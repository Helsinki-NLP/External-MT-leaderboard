Members of the National Assembly for Wales worried they 'll be compared to Muppets
There is a stir among the Members of the National Assembly for Wales over a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name of the Welsh Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly from various political parties are concerned that the new name will seem ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly for Wales from the Labour Party said that MWP rymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly for Wales from the Plaid party said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is "open" to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The National Assembly of Wales committee, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: 'It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who make the final decision on their new title.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the National Assembly for Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people thought the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty in reaching a consensus.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that it would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the result of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's are silent, those of Harlem are hard
"The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a café and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today there is no trace of a café or church.
He said it's understandable that coffee shops have disappeared.
"People are now socializing in a different way", he said.
Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighbourhood, where people regularly visit.
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the churches will not last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to the beginning.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people who will not help would live in the remaining neighborhood shelters.
"The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white", he says, "which will lead to the closure of these churches even faster, because the people who move into these flats are unlikely to become members of the church community".
Both churches were once built by a white church congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A black church congregation from the area took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or get promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the church, they also purchased a brick structure.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St Martin's, proudly called the bell tower "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the instrument in July referred to it in a different way: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bar in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bar of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would want to pass the costs to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who went for lobsters in California
Saturday, the first day of lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was hiding for lobsters in California, and the boy sustained injuries, according to the report.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and several others paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was screaming because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I got bit!
His clavicle was open, and Hammel saw it as he approached the boy.
I shouted for everyone to get out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach watch captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the vicinity a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and is setting up beauty salons where specialist assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to take over the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods continue to fall. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove successful, they will be introduced in even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets are trying to replace the shelves that once stood for TVs, micro-movies and interior goods with other products.
Sainsbury's is looking to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be increased, with exhibition space per brand, as in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume house will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first having opened in Croydon, south London, and the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets on a daily basis, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, says that the stores will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes on discount stores Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago, which the company says has increased food sales and increased returns on acquisitions.
Last time the supermarket tried to make its beauty and pharmacy departments look different, it flopped.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy department to the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy units in stores three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a comprehensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have completely redesigned our beauty department to make it more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our staff, who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands offers something for everyone, and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make it easier for our customers to buy their beauty products from us and not to shop the old fashioned way.
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs out of £11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "outraged" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle company, and wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories.
The Jones and Willoughby company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby for withdrawing at the last minute from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "outraged" when Willoughby announced during a tough meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new contracts (worth up to £1.5 million) were not allowing enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said "Truly" was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would secure its future in the long run, and provide enough for the next few decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the head office in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a friendship that lasted for years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became chairman of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source in Jones' entourage said last night: "We have no comment on his business affairs".
♪ Hard language ♪ ♪ And then there was love between us ♪
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment he made that some people would find "inappropriate for a president" and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
I didn't give up anything.
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting, and Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step toward denuclearization in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States following North Korea's initial disarmament initiatives.
The United States, meanwhile, is continuing its sanctions to keep the pressure on, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We're doing very well in North Korea", he said.
We were close to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results, with the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers to their home countries.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was homeless, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
'In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they are not asking for international help, which is difficult for us,' said Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the foreign rescuers will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, it is still particularly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to protect against tsunamis, but along other coasts, you rarely see them.
The fact that no tsunami warning siren was present in Palu, even though a warning was in effect, probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under ideal conditions, traveling from one Indonesian island to another can be difficult.
National disasters complicate the logistics even further.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the disaster site.
Improving Indonesia's seamless infrastructure was one of the main focuses of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is facing a funding shortfall, and that's while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority now follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool has secured an impressive draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, scoring in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was passed by Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 100 feet from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 down.
He taped the ball to the left and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He evaded the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was very difficult to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching and I tried, I didn't really think about it, I just kicked the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time, after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel at Mateo Kovacic, then rushed through the midfield to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool into the net, next to the back post.
Liverpool play at 3pm on Wednesday in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Relief Agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the 7.5 magnitude quake last Friday, which also produced waves as high as 20 feet, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
This morning the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am in Grayson Mews on John Street, her body showing stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking local residents to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they have any video footage of a dashcam, because they may have information that is essential to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now being told it will be hours before they can return home.
A cop would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
She keeps saying, "What a pity!"
At 2pm, two police cars were inside the compound and a third was just outside.
Inside the compound, a number of officers were watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with a log 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue in the British Parliament is the latest victim of the "history rewriting" scandal.
The banishment of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the current debate over the removal of statues would lead to the painting of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful statue of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion held in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many say still deserves recognition.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognised and commemorated.
Murder-lusted pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, whose surname is only known as Yuan, was found dead at a barn in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, with his artery punctured and covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have traveled from the neighboring province of Yunnan with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and a door to a neighboring pigsty was open.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on its mouth was in the pigsty.
A forensic examination showed that the 250-kg pig had killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and mutilated", said the cousin, whose surname is Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his nephew's.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
It is reported that Yuan's family and the market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare, but there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect, he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it reaches the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With winds of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time Sunday morning, and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is being pushed northward, toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture reacting with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Local rainfall of 2 to 10 centimetres will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause rainfall of 5 to 8 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected to be about three to four inches in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible, because tropical rainfall can be very scattered.
It is strongly discouraged to walk into the desert when tropical rainfall is imminent.
Heavy rainfall can turn ravines into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching trough will bring some heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There's a chance of up to a half inch of rain, which could lead to small debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening through Monday morning, after which the rain will be more dispersed late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, temperatures in the United States can fluctuate greatly as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes results in large temperature differences over short distances.
There's a nice example of a dramatic temperature difference in the middle of the United States on a Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm October, with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] everywhere, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, it could be 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States until mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on one of the six television networks the poignant testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, as broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the indictment for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that a drunken Kavanaugh touched her and tried to undress her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a lively testimony that he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who are looking in an office.
By comparison, that's like a football playoff or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which has all the support for Kavanaugh's appointment, had the most viewers on the day of the hearing, averaging 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure in the events of Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, CNN and CBS cameras recorded Friday morning protesters shouting at him as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood there for a few minutes with his eyes down as he was being insulted, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, "You have power, while so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various stations were broadcasting the whole thing live as the Judiciary Committee voted hours later on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee by next week, something the Democrats in the minority are pushing.
Flake was persuaded by his friend Chris Coons, a Democrat and senator.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have the votes to pass Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of 'politically playing' with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a separate interview, on the same front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's taxes was "absurd".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the death of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
Police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail has been set at $350,000, the attorney general reports.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their efforts and their commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6'2" and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "destroyed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"This is an event you always hope will never happen", says Wade.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected multiple rumblings and vibrations.
Photos of a thin layer of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, have appeared on social media.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with riot police, as thousands participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote that split the region into two factions.
A group of masked pro-separatists, stopped by riot police, shelled the officers with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled their batons up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive", while their opponents shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but is being celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent, although turnout was low and people who are against secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, leading to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out on the spot from Friday night to Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but people were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won a decisive victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was a snap election, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"Tensions are rising", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
'A run for the European elections is the best way to denounce the deterioration of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,' he said.
London: men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly hit in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. local time Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It's possible that at some point, a crossbow was fired at the car.
Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought them the win
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers, and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in an 18-game series since he has been manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came up against Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have failed to win a play-off in the Premier League this season, and they face leader Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, is undefeated, the team has now won six straight games in his division, and Coach Holt has not suffered a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing chances against strong visitors
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the first goal, as their direct play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal, then Alan Lithgow, who was catching the head ball from Craig Halkett, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team enjoyed the Rangers' play, and waited for their chance calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston opened the scoring, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At that point, the Rangers had been in possession of the ball for a while, but the home defense was unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to prevent a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball into Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow missed the goal after a run by his fellow Livingston's.
Continuously, forwards reached Livingston's penalty area, but were denied each time, twice a penalty was denied, once after Halketts attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and once for handball.
Livingston's 'phenomenal' - the analysis of the work of the
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played exceptionally well and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their squad has hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but Holt in particular deserves much recognition for the way he has blown up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with a superbly organised defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were unable to break through.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed to beat the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security concerns when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and accused by others of being an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were identifying the man and will notify his next of kin.
The road is closed in several places, buses are being diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in disorderly conduct
Six guards were injured in a disturbance at a maximum security men's prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.
The riots broke out at around 9.30am local time on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado-cipher units have been deployed to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one ward.
The guards were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison department spokesman said, "Special trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible will at least be referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had been treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to jail for a serious disturbance involving a personnel attack with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (with potential positive effects for dry areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest desert area, bringing with it flood risks.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's expected to start raining Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts as high as 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get three to five inches of rain, and here and there, 10 inches may be possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
While flooding is a major concern, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map that identifies current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
The trajectory of Hurricane Rosa is reaching the mainland through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still hurricane-force Sunday morning with maximum winds of 140 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm is hitting cooler waters in the Pacific, weakening them.
That's why it's expected to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall could occur in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 8 to 15 centimeters of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 25 centimeters possible", weather.com reported.
Rosa is moving north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest desert area", said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded at approximately 4 a.m. local time Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed anything that happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has suffered the meanness, the wrath' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has continually "suffered the meanness, the wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliant and incredible character, quality and courage that day.
"A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to recognize one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record", he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president was referring indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican lead in the midterm elections.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part, he said.
That's why I'm always up for great candidates.
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct us".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is rising
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, with many washed away when giant waves washed ashore, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet hit the shore as night fell, crushing many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, there were people on the beach who did not leave immediately and became victims of the tsunami", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Bureau (BNPB), told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also brought other dangers: it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Relief Agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to shake with aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, with some 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication with Donggala is completely broken, we have no information at all, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement.Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", the Red Cross said.
The organization was heavily criticized on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building in panic screaming at people on the street below to warn them of an impending tsunami.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for emergency use only and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami is rising above 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city, where workers in the courtyard of their office are sheltering in canvas tents, but passed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult task of getting the relief effort under way, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, goods and personnel can only be admitted if the location of a disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 As soon as the government says: O.K., this is a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami hit Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people are so eager to hear in terrible natural disasters like this one.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a veteran of the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse had spread through the paragliding community and that in the hours after, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling out an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was trying to fill it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the report.
While he was doing it, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: "The being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been briefly referred to as Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the lead-up to his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance on the show for "emotional reasons", says the show's creator.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means jij, West said earlier this year, when he was talking about the title of his album to radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it is us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means "the only one", to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also worked with and without the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican President Promises No Use of Armed Forces Against Civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has pledged never to use military force against civilians, as the country marches into the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military force to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, and leftist student movements erupted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that youths often join criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The United States should double funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal A.I. strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: it wants to be the number one country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could lead to doubling the chance that the next big achievement for A.I. will happen in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that beat the best player of American Othello, and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese division of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help discover the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"China doesn't take our best academics, the companies do", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been recruiting the best people from universities to work on A.I. in the last few years.
Lee said that U.S. efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
"Doctors in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card", he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides financial support to staff from academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to engage partners from industry and academia in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it would invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in A.I. research.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the creation of a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change
Last Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name to the 'Republic of North Macedonia', which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and would no longer prevent Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims Greek territory, so Greece vetoed Macedonia's admission to the European Union and NATO.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign would not guarantee the required turnout of at least 50 per cent, thus making the referendum potentially invalid.
The question on the ballot is worded as follows: Do you support NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have indicated that they will respect the result, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout at the time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters turned out to vote.
"I come to vote because it is important for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on changing the country's name to open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that had been set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
'We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as full members, not through a back door,' said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the overwhelming majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" as a result would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, it must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes Brighton's full defence and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a short-cut to Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, with Manchester City winning the match 2-0.
It was like a dime, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got the ball first in the midfield.
He raced through three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
That's when Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he passed to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
Aguero is suffering from foot problems, Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first Premier League lead.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful pass across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player kicked the ball into the net just before it was too far.
City will face Hoffenheim at 12.55pm on Tuesday in the group stage of the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play ball and make it hard for the Rockies to make the playoffs.
With the Washington Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force a fresh start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are any repercussions for the Rockies' playoff run, which is currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least secured a wild card for the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win over the Nationals last Friday, but now they're looking to do everything they can to secure their first division title.
While there's nothing left for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with this crowd is going to be optimal and the other team is probably playing at the highest level I'd encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of that?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on the move Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to draft Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was scheduled to make his 34th start, was in the pitching field Thursday and would pitch the following Sunday, although that's normally his day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is organizing a rally in West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republican ticket in the midterm elections.
Everything we've achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't run, but I actually do run. That's why I run for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued: "We're seeing a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do to do it.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct us".
"And we've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and false and lying".
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to loud cheers from the public.
Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
I am, after all, the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told we are not welcome simply because we say what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on issues like this one where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
And that has been the case at most of the Friday night GC meetings during the eight years that I have been a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a 'kinder, softer' policy has long since been forgotten, if it had ever been started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had similar political views to me, suddenly expected me to make a change and take a position that I would never have otherwise agreed to, from topics like national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to an audience, whatever I say, there are insults on social media calling for me to reject my candidacy for the next election, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a Labour member.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day but do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that severe abuse seems to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of no confidence" or change in selection rules, the party is getting smaller.
I have been advised many times over the last two years to keep my composure, not to just voice my opinion out loud and then I would not get into trouble.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I've never kept my politics a secret, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East was clear about my policy positions and my differences with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country is dragged into a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have only one message, and it is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy for the next election or political opportunities will not deter me from acting in what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on its way to the top
Two late tries may have slightly skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr rightfully triumphs in this glorious match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that brought home the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was content.
"We've had a tough time so far in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I'm a happy man", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: "All credit to Ayr, they've used their chances better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, completed by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to a lead, but a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors game) allowed Melrose to make the figures speak and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
Climo took a penalty to give Ayr an extra lead and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the break, making it 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long halted by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and once the match was restarted, Ayr could continue to run out by a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and again Melrose was dealt the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a very high-pressure match.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score a touchdown on the penalty line-out behind the advancing Ayr mound.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.

'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a rigged naval office in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean blue flag.
At all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is ours".
It is a duty to win them back.
Throughout land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to cede to Chile after a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which is due to be delivered on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is naturally looking forward to the outcome with positive prospects", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the Court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will argue in Bolivia's favor that Chile, after decades of heated talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also, much is at stake for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is up for a controversial re-election bid next year, with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings indicates that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have worsened over the last four years.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government", Zárate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has completely undermined all the goodwill that Chile may have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue their talks, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further after this.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision was unusually hasty.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "utopia" that the continued sanctions and American objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubt that Pyongyang is serious when it says it would give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris unveil the latest collection of huge head covers, soon to be on sale in your neighborhood
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your eyes completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were a must-see on Instagram this summer, and these designers have been sending their eye-popping creations onto the catwalk.
Valentino's signature piece was a giant beige hat with a feathery wide rim that hung over the models' eyes.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons studded with gems, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had the lips sewn tightly, more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream.
And if you're willing to follow this bold fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by "La Bomba", the straw hat with a two-meter-wide rim that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was all over social media also led to another big creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that was sewn into the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather hinge, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores this summer, and given the enormous impact the designer has made, it would be hard to ignore the demand for extra-large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have an excellent record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of further excellent exam results, and furthermore individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects at the forefront of schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and bonds of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's examinations, we can deduce that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
In all, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages scored high.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS-affiliated schools, showed that 72 percent of students scored high (A) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French, and 63 percent of students in Spanish also scored A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of the barriers to filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, having learned a second language will give him a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only language to stand out above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is important for today's children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools choose the languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK as they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done right.

LeBron is making his debut Sunday with the Lakers in San Diego.
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first game against the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It's still to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games leading up to the season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare", he said.
Trump's election rally period in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a long series of rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
It's the first of five rallies Trump is planning for the coming week, including stops in places he loves, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on the nomination of his favorite Supreme Court nominee pending, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November vote is held.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you view it online?
The rally for Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the YouTube livestream.
Trump will likely be referring to the hearings for nominee Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have been heightened with Kavanaugh being charged with sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republican candidates for the November election gain momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the five rallies over the next week are meant to "boost volunteers and supporters" as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, Reuters reported.
"Control of Congress is so important to his program that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help the Republican nominee for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the lead-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of chance is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's got the best shot right now?
"They had a six-point lead at the start, and now it's just four more, so we kind of feel like luck is on our side at the moment", said Jordan Spieth before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead of the other 12 in the game.
Americans feel, as Spieth said, that they have a little bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points each of the four.
Spieth has been a formidable opponent from tee to green and he's setting the example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when playing well got louder as his round progressed and he made a crucial putt that made game four a success as he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt that won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind that would suggest he believes the U.S. team is undefeated.
"You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game", said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delightful European duo has four out of four and can do no wrong.
Mollywood was the only duo not to play bogey on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the back nine on Friday mornings they avoided bogey.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy crowd, they are the players to beat on Sunday.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
It is premature, however, to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were short-handed by Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a gap for the Spaniard and the Swede that they could not overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The European team has played its best so far and has a good lead in the run-up to the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is off to a great start on the final day of the Ryder Cup, with the four-ball and foursomes on Saturday, 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The spirited duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team to two more wins than Tiger Woods, who was having a hard time, giving them a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who are eager to win back the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, were stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needs to score eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After they had knocked Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully matched, beating a disappointing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for Thursday morning's four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three, with 2&1.
Yet Europe was not at ease on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the American standard on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 from the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It is only twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with a four-point lead at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has plenty of tie-breaking as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they've been second for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems overrated.
North Korea says it will "by no means" unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are increasing distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see a corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm".
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, with North Korea being rewarded as it took further steps, it was striking that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the international community to ease the tough sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is pushing for denuclearization first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the declaration of the end of war", Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a castle in the air by people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only reinforce our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader did suggest at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: If the other party to this denuclearization issue had been South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at the US mainland after President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, this year praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much more needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued vigorously and firmly until we have achieved complete, final, verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to severely curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
Barely hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised during a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all students more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world's largest university often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which, to his knowledge, is unique in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being organized for the first time this year, will teach students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students were severely sleep-deprived during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices, and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how lack of sleep increases the long-term risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a campus map with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know all this, just as people have a right to know what the choice of cigarettes is doing to their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in studying overnight still exists, he says, and with modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Providing adequate, good-quality sleep should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to write the course, having attended classes with the professor last year when he was a freshman at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure the course was available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar programme of study before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm for getting up, but also to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" from electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men out of the game
The Rangers again saw their away game disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and beat Steven Gerrard's weak team 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox were hoping for their first away win since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to clinch the defeat, just Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games, with his side now eight points behind Hearts, who are still at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored at seven minutes into the half, and the Rangers failed to score the equaliser.
The Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston rising to third, with only a difference in goals against Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get into even more trouble, as Boundary Judge Calum Spence was being treated for a head injury after apparently being thrown an object by the visiting team's supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his squad, they passed Ayr and go into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained in the same team for Livingston, who had taken a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have been delighted by the way his well-trained team was able to block the opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga first passed the ball and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in his sights, but the midfielder could not finish.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked into the back row.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in getting close to the goal.
Alfredo Morelos at least felt he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after 15 minutes of play, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to score twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who had previously been goalkeeper at Ibrox, was able to stop Lassana Coulibaly's head ball and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot with ease.
Livingston's 34th-minute opener may not be in the running for the overall game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not up to par with Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and selected Menga, who kicked the ball into the goal with ease.
Gerrard made an interception with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent switch, which had almost immediate effect when winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racketed off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston kept forcing the visitors to play the kind of game Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor held on and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton requested a penalty kick after a run-in with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for those who can count... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become a staple of science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in "Bells or Coronado", a 1950 film starring the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers:  That's a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
It's really popping now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and "kill" malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient to transform them into a laboratory.
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers and then they get re-injected.
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, then modifying the cells in the laboratory to see the HER2 protein, which is common in all types of cancer, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching these cells to target cancer cells has been shown to work in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West takes a pro-Trump rant and wears a MAGA hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a dissonant performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After delivering his third number of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a cap with the words "Make America Great Again", he lashed out at the Democrats and repeatedly backed Trump.
 Often when I talk to a white person, they ask:  How can you sympathize with Trump? He's a racist! 
If I was worried about racism, I'd have left America long ago, he said.
The Saturday Night Live broadcast began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon defied the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's rant was not aired, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock's post is a way to play the dragon with West.
West also complained to the audience that he was shot backstage for his hat.
They teased me backstage.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat".
They've been treating me like shit!
And then they say I'm apathetic, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how apathetic he looks?" He said he was going to put on that Superman cap, because that means you can't order me around.
Give me some love.
At least two cheers came from the audience, and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who heard from an attendee: "The whole studio was suddenly silent".
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR FAILING THE MASS".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "just being herself, and that's beautiful".
But I choose NOT to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
"We too", she added.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, as of now, he says, he is "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also went by the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is coming out to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor echoes the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that when young boys see such roles on screen, they often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something went wrong" and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he strongly believes the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is a really important question for me personally at the moment: where has our manhood gone wrong?' he said.
"What did we teach men as they grew up, that now puts us in this situation?"
Kit thinks television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, through its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and on the street that makes young boys think they must be a certain kind of man?
And I think that's one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
Because something has clearly gone wrong for young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be acting in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, as he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful follow-up to Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife during the series, so in that way I have left my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people in the country have been affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in the past in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contract HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminalized in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff member leaked Republican senators' records and points to "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters is challenging allegations that one of her staffers has posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the accusations are being spread by "extreme right" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data, which appeared online Thursday, was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and contained the information of a Waters employee, Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie", Waters said.
My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angry", wrote Fleischer.
From this, you can tell she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
If a man is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He must not rebel.
He mustn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
"Strong, if it is true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified the relevant agencies and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice", she said, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new British-themed film, we now traditionally look for references to Brexit, and that certainly seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comedy action films starring a weak spy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this lighthearted satire about how badly we're doing going to be the latest export for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with his protruding eyes and flexible facial features at least manages to control everything, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was designed for movie-goers in countries where people speak a language other than English.
He's obviously the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to glamorous glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a touch of that guy who contributed one note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is originally based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials (which everyone has forgotten by now) who always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English has one or two good moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tap against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves include comedy as an ingredient, and do it well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and the mad disaster of Johnny English seems to me less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean played by Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identities of all active British secret agents, much to the dismay of the acting agent, a sadly minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems in her head and terribly unpopular as a politician.
Her intelligence advisors say she should use a retired spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunt-ass Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher in a fancy institution, but informally teaches undercover work, and here's some fun in the story, because the spy lectures of English remind me of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine captain, a turbulent and juvenile role below Vicki Pepperdine's.
So the Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is unfortunately falling for the charms of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of creepy, crazy fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, they start a riot aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes sheer anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all the registers are opened, but as well-intentioned and as tumultuous as the scene is, it does remind you of children's television.
It's not all that original.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I wonder, can't the British film industry really come up with a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies the party is devising a plan whereby Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan whereby British people work four days a week but are paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants employers to pass on the savings they are making as a result of the AI revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
This allows workers to enjoy a three-day weekend and still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea fits the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the balance of the country towards the workers.
The change to a four-day week has already been approved by the Confederation of Trade Unions, which sees it as a good way to ensure that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits within the party's drive to shift the balance of the economy more to the benefit of workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy".
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
The aim, however, is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to make clear his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the "faceless executives" and the "profiteers" at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not get back the full value of their shares, as a Labour government could apply 'reductions' based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees on company boards and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI's findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support for the nominee.
In an interview aired Sunday on "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that might cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open about this than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I told the court that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be firmly planted.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the charge should contain dynamite", he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival is being organized, an annual music event that will feature a very impressive lineup of stars with an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will gather at the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to raise awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
Concertgoers who wanted to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise meaningfully raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of 'clicktivism', making people feel like they're making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, aimed at a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have helped world leaders to commit to more than $37 billion in policy proposals that will change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised through sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds raised have so far impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most prominent declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives aimed at "helping children realize their full potential", which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, of donors, of other national governments and of Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after sending over 5,000 petitions asking the UK government to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced support for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website, which asked, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, in which we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed in the end because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use navy for 'blockade' to impede Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can resort to the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, stated Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to trade in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And the official says there are ways and means to stop this.
"The United States has that capability, with the navy, to keep the shipping lanes open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia with the approach to Iran and noted that they are not fundamentally different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a country that has only a "small art", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trum of Berlin says has made Moscow's "prisoners".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "seriously considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she is "seriously considering" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a local rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and that includes a woman in the top position", she said, according to the political newsmagazine The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump at the town hall rally, saying he was "steering this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and of Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we have to wait for an investigation by the FBI before we vote on this".
However, a poll released Thursday found that a majority of Warren's own supporters believe she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of her running.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names associated with possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD from Track Palin during a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the force in September.
He was arrested and charged following a domestic violence report Monday night.
"Through what my own son has to go through, what he's going through now that he's back, I understand other families who are suffering the effects of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they're coming back a little different, they're coming back and they're getting harder, they're coming back and they're wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military people have given for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, Wasilla police spokesman.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a "friend of the court" statement in Washington state court last Friday in support of an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been released.
She says that her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's been detained in Texas for that.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of people seeking asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an impediment is contrary to that principle", states a statement by the 'Friend of the Court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants entry to the United States harms the U.S. economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and "provide the country with the necessary workforce".
Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, in June ordered judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these are serious problems, that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched their soaked possessions for valuables that could still be used.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded, as far as they are not damaged by the 7.5 earthquake.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of the possibility of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of his feelings as the devastating earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed against the remains of a wall", Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, and then I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in an American daily, praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid-for op-ed page of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, according to US officials quoted by Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, with each other imposing ever-higher import tariffs.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and formerly longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading this propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the freedom of speech and the free press, a long-held tradition in America, by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find in a kiosk in the center of Beijing vain dissenting voices and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article", as if he did not say which newspaper it was.
The Kavanaugh debacle alienated Republicans from female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
With many prominent Republicans rallying around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him against various sexual assault charges, analysts warn that this will hit them hard, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this issue have been heightened and most Republicans have already indicated they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) 's last-minute attempt to advocate for an FBI investigation would be enough to satisfy angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow and they are not going to forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.-based news outlet.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach record highs", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high, and it's true.
But it can go even higher, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they disagree with the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her allegation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a setback might follow if the Republicans pushed through the nomination.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former Republican Party chairman, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in committee, or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is going to be in court, but it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be divided on who to believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a small majority opting for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony and 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was definitely or probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's prosecution, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was under the influence of alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both students at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the tech legend, is a company that is based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "world domination" is the guiding idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now", he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
It can store contact lists, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all coming together in one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was bought by IBM, a few developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not be in talks with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that completely turns all their business models on their head at once".
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web being built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
After the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergyman and Victoria Cross recipient from WWI
The only Church of England clergyman to have won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier is being honoured 100 years later in the town of his birth.
Lieutenant Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been honored.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He later rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and killing three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never guess, but also something that makes me feel humbled".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honoured to be able to play a part in the parade", adding that "the bravery of a true hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a Bellator 206 full of followers and you miss the most important moment.
The San Jose poster listed 13 fights, including six in the main section, and was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed up all night for this fight.
One fan described the move to the children's show on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"Government regulations prohibit showing content that is not suitable for children after 6:00 a.m., so we had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, "yes.
Scott Coker, Bellator's chief executive, said they were adjusting their programming to ensure that UK viewers would also get a chance in the future.
"I think, in terms of the counter-match, we can solve this problem", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of texts went back and forth, and believe me, not all of them were equally friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case. It was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We're limiting the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally do, we're trying to make it even better for the fans, but we're just going too far.
It is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Olympic long jumper Tom Daley says that while he felt inferior because of his sexual orientation as a child, this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to college, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that parenting had contributed to his less appreciation for winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a disconnect on Laverne's first program, Daley said that during his childhood he felt "less than" others because it was "not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys".
He said: "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are real facts that have given me the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "somebody" so that he would not disappoint people if they eventually found out about his nature.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he considered himself fortunate to be able to live openly without further consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to go through so much at such a young age", he competed in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find anyone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have said that it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already gotten the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, 'You won't be there to sit in the front row anymore, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until his breathing actually stopped and he died that I could finally recognize that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd been dreaming about this all my life, diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Pride by Heather Small, which had taken a strong hold on him on the way to the games and which still gives him a kick in the ass.
Desert Island Discs is heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is competing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors splits the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, trying to figure out what's missing.
Having never been known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs routinely penalizes stray balls.
And if the track itself isn't daunting enough, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth match on Sunday, who is tied with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the start of the 12 singles matches, start well, Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he could hardly do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's done so much for these teams, in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more from it, but it is what it is and it is the way we felt we should have acted.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson could beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties to his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain tangible impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's got a way with people, he likes to make jokes with people, and he's a great guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to play him occasionally last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game".
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that a big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the singles matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually crossed the finish line by the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just", said Bjorn, who was called here, after watching the 2018 squad win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not a game that's been played.
Everyone will have to be fully committed tomorrow.
Get to work and execute the plan properly.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to win this trophy, and that's what we have to stay focused on.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have, but we're also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world".
Pleased with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of the game.
Tomorrow is another challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performance, and that's another whole other discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, your skills as a golfer are really tested.
That's the message you need to get to the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go and let him get the best of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience on both sides of this kind of turnaround on the final day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had pumped up his players for the final day.
"We have 12 important matches to bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medina.
When we get the momentum, there's gonna be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've aligned our lineup to this and we're sending the men out in the order we think is best and, you know, we're going to try to pull something out of the hat tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the lineup.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we're so constantly covered", Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to enter service in 2014, replacing the aging Cold War-era warships, but it will take at least another year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the lead ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates up to two years in a row, far from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to enable Germany to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware flaws' that would render the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels are operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, half the manpower of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also clear that the ship was suffering from severe overweight, which would reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion, compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the newest frigates are made all the more important by recent warnings that the German navy is losing power.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defense committee in Germany, admitted that the navy actually "has a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said that the problem has grown over time like a snowball, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were available for the navy.
National Trust eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation efforts.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bats, the brown great-eared bats and the water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the bat's activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and what kind of what it does.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to provide a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how best to maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of accommodation and sometimes rescue operations.
In fact, the organization has set up the first and only bat sanctuary in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there's so much we don't know about bats, and so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of bat control before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unintentional destruction of a nest could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and many of our species simply don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies assault charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo qualified accusations of assault as 'fake news' and said people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news" hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just like,
What they're saying today, fake news", says the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's not a bad thing.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and by and by", the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to the indictment filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a "99 percent" "good guy", but that he is sometimes abandoned by that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that it was mutually agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "afraid of the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says she wants the arrangement invalidated because she's been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of leaving Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and has left for Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' if car manufacturers leave
The UK 'will forever regret' losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the economy minister.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory come to a halt", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concerns about the impact of a no-deal exit from the EU on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The most worrying concerns of car manufacturers are risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy operator in the Union.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border unrest, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be halted in that case.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU 'is precisely tailored to avoid those checks at the border'.
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity", he told listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long the production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and who represents the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been the Washington gossip machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to impeach the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors were circulating that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the Trump press secretary, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set for it yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters were troubled by this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not caused by a dislike of the "attention-grabbing" TV reporters, although, she added, "I won't deny that they are trying to get attention".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any other president before him", she said, without providing any evidence of this, "We looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, making an outspoken and sometimes bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to EU staff working in NHS Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and wishes that they continue to work in the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working in the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: 'Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
I therefore want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is surely your home and we would like you to stay".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters the accident happened shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline and he kind of went down there", Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen immediately on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are known as to the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher levies when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher levies when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless, according to new plans by the Conservatives.
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in levies is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when buying a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who is attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to pass it on to high earners.
The increase in levies is levied on individuals and firms who do not pay UK tax, with the extra proceeds being channeled into a government effort to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which is on top of the current levies, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes bought for rent, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year in this way.
An estimated 13 percent of new construction in London is bought by non-residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for startups to gain a foothold on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'ghost towns' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a reduction in the fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it and called on May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to repair Britain's 'housing scandal'.
Corbyn has announced a striking set of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to evictions 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister restoring the 'British Dream', that life is better for every new generation.
And that means our broken housing market needs to be repaired.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for non-residents and foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of ever owning a home has become too vague, and the humiliation of living without a roof over one's head too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to one day manage Scotland.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east of England, which is currently third in League One, three points from first.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B team and that was the end of it", Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child I often saw Scotland play at Hampden Park with my father and it's something that continues to attract me.
However, that possibility would come only if I was successful in managing a club".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not intimidated to become the successor to these established names at a big club, having previously turned down advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment is measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he says.
"It is not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there".
Ross has only been managing for three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching group.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more at ease now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads", he recalled of the moment he took over Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I was doing pretty well, I was earning pretty well, and I had a few pretty highlights.
But football can be hard.
There are a lot of things you face every week.
I still do, given the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I am, I feel more comfortable than I ever have in my adult life".
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for British pubs struggling to survive, but it has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue was down 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that restaurants were now hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on selling liquor fared best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants declining.
Pubs that also focus on selling food also get sunlight, but not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems people only went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the monthly beverage turnover was 6.6 percent higher, while the food turnover was 3 percent lower".
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst for the leisure and hospitality industries, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the outdoor market.
It is not surprising, then, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-oriented operators and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures of August will give the much-needed respite".
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, a survey reveals
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth in 'fake Insta pages'
This news has reinforced fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "main account" that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11, set up social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta accounts", a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news has reinforced fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean "main account" that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager asking others to "rape" her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where they cannot be found by their parents and teachers".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletic World, as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete on and off the track and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport's governing bodies to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish athletic community, the UK and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her election to the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope to contribute and help to govern the sport in Scotland".
The American who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four Olympic gold medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, was unable to walk after a TIA.
He tweeted: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It's been a tremendous amount of hard work, but I'm now fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has spread the word online by advertising nursing mothers as compared to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what has been called "the world's quietest portable breast pump", consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released an ironic music video-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump offers to pregnant mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a haystack to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't onions, these are my breasts".
The chorus then goes on to say, "Pump, pump, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, pump, I milk the ladies".
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, immediately sparked an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has generated hundreds of comments, mostly mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it justifies the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of birth".
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: "This is obviously traumatic for mother and baby.
But, yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "This ad is so far from reality".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Those pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I didn't do much research.
This is a brilliant product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who pump (often at work or in a toilet) and then feel like 'cows.'
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative for the dairy industry.'
At the end of the video, you see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who plow sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing mothers who pump and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping and the challenges that come with it, and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the tough rhetoric and tough policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and they are afraid to jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to hand over their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that his organization had arrested dozens of people who had signed up to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or relatives of sponsors are illegal in this country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
We are prosecuting these individuals", Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within one month of the start of detention, instead of the standard 60 days, according to the shelter staff.
Many of them will be in court via videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their legal status application before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in detention, the greater the likelihood that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child struggling are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey's 'occupying force' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy fight until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly trained and advising Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that conditions are favourable for their return and he blamed "some Western countries for spreading irrational fears" that keep most refugees away.
"We have made an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They politicize a matter that should only be a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has opened the way for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement has "clear deadlines" and said he hoped that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to revising the articles of the current constitution" and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is ended prematurely by impeachment and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever".
At the moment, however, there are no signs of watching fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership at CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings for cable with 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, the executive producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", a series about a secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you realize that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of "deep-secret" sources by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear", who are talking about Paul Manafort's $15,000 paul leather jacket ("a garment full of arrogance", according to The Washington Post), and who are discussing the implications of Stormy Daniels' colorful description of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I'll never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"What he does to give you the impression that it's a reality show is, in part, he puts you on something new every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the rotating cast of the Trump show and the daily plot twists (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you feel like you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all these weird shows, not so long ago, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right".

Money from outside is pouring into the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a flood of money, thanks to a redistricting that will force two incumbent representatives to run for the same seat.
The newly redistricted district of Pittsburg faces Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were rescheduled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally rescheduled ("gerrymandering") in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a campaign finance brawl between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-attended special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump had won this district by a margin of 20 percentage points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China and has refrained from doing so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While internal meetings were going on, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced their desire for the conference to continue, making it impossible to take any possible punitive action against El Salvador in advance.
The plan now is for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys have returned without further ado to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any harsh messages about punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Mr. Bolton's behalf declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, for which weighty evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in a Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump will have to answer to that institution, just as he's preparing to address the voters again, and maybe he'll have to answer to a jury in a court of law.
That's a lot of knives, and I'm not suggesting that Trump's downfall is inevitable, or that of his European counterparts.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points and the implacable advance of democracy is either accelerated or slowed by them.
Americans are currently facing several of these kinds of inflection points.
What are we going to do when Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's in charge of the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this paper reported that he had suggested last year that he would hold secret talks with the president and that he had speculated about the president's fitness for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me, 60 years later, away to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the game against Rapid Wien
Rangers are to visit Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really have a good squad", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but overall, a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game too but if the public is behind us I'm sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, with all that's happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a feel-good factor hanging over the club.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can push through now, put the past behind us and be successful again".
Women can't sleep because they're afraid of their pensions
Although the survey respondents had a clear idea of the type of care they wanted, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said that they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps necessary to have this conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where we're gonna start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known in good time.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial adviser: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care could include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or putting your equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when insurance is required.
Get a health care proxy so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals abide by your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to make sure that bills are paid when you are no longer able to do so.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Record these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes through".
Man shot multiple times with an air-pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air-pressure rifle as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, over 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because of the shutdown of communications, official authorities have not received any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of Central Celebes Province, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Atjeh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that has hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed some 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offenses, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention center on $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "innocent, absolutely" when asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before the Alaska Department of Veterans Affairs.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic abuse, interference with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while under the influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran's group in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly continued during his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred just outside the center of Celebes, which is northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for suspected terrorist in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, was charged with using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists who came in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent demanding the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry the death penalty, according to the court filing.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering-related murder, a typical charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation", according to the prosecutors, and they described the manner in which Sajpov carried out the attack as "horrible, cruel and depraved".
"Sajfoello Habiboellayevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than a decade since a case in the Southern District of New York called for the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed two years earlier after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He let the detectives know he felt good about what he did, and they let the police know.
Sajpov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts of conspiracy.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a "people's army" today at a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians should 'feel the heat' of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested giving him the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would 'be out of it' if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the deeply divided ranks is underlined by two pro-Remain Conservatives taking part in a separate anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track as it is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
She is also a strong supporter of the European Union, and she has been a strong supporter of the European Union.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wants to "throw Chequers in the trash".
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was the one who was pulling the plug, we'd be out of here", Bone said.
The Member for Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash.'
He said: 'We did not fight two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false".
Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns also joined the march, telling reporters: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not for votes, it is unpopular with our party and with our activists who go door to door and make sure we get elected.
Drop the Chequers and listen".
In a message directed to May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the gathering that politicians must "feel the heat" if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you get away with this.'
In a message to the elated crowd, he added: "I want you to set fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has won us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we are once again an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved Tories Against Brexit flags after the group was formed over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Labour MP, made a joke about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can take care of IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete and utter farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to "think hard" about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's "going to think hard about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican congressman who co-chaired Trum's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might be running against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at a town hall since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she would run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrested after shooting LSU's Wayde Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died from the effects", police commander Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has confessed to being at the scene of the crime, possession of a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-4 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games and started 10 games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel leaves him the victory after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold as he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowded tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back to the lead after a wheel-on-wheel action that reluctantly forced the Ferrari driver to release space on the inside after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a while, sticking to his tyre choice and aiming for a quick finish, so he could overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and he let me pass.
The team has done its best for places one and two", said Hamilton.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday election rally for insisting she was not the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people can be 'cruel, unkind and untruthful.'"
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that's been taking place in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you're the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue", he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer -- did you leak the document -- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak", he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter listing the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's allegations secret, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go along with it in confidence and I handled it in confidence, as she had asked".
But the president didn't seem to believe her denial, and he commented at the Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
"They are determined to seize power, by any means necessary.
You see the cruelty, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to ride to take power and get control back", the president is reported to have said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League to Belfast Giants by winning the return leg 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals to lead by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team over, before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied the game for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up for a late loss on Friday night to then beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave the assist that doubled Beauvillier's lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt took the lead for Cownie's equaliser at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer led the Giants into the first half with a lead, as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard brought them back to a level with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match, late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while arranging for hundreds to escape the earthquake in a plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after he died for making a plane with hundreds of people on board take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday, an earthquake that subsequently triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still afflicting the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then ready on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart to hear that", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, and the country's disaster management agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of 20 feet [6 m] have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Bodies are brought in by ambulances every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimum markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse".
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the soldiers present: "I call on all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing, after previously reporting that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane was flooded during landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and some others managed to wade through the water that came to their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working at a nearby shipyard also helped with the rescue work by taking people ashore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank further into the water some 100 feet [30 m] deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered with PNG over the past 20 years, but none of these have been related to Air Niugini.
Analyst tracks the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a few hours of testimony as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used cell phone logs to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she took her own life.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talking to Sanford.
Sanford was on the stand Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told Sanford that he was with him in his truck that night, Sanford said that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis wiped his phone's text messages, phone calls, and contact information.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin with final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip hop"?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently enjoyed a revival in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York nanny sues a couple over a "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mis-sent text message in which the mother complained about 'another black man.'
The couple denies being racist and calls the lawsuit "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her horror when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro woman when she met her on her first day of work in 2016.
"No more black weather", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice no less than twice.
According to the New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her mistake, explaining that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was therefore expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for $350 a day for the six months she was hired to intern with the family, albeit without a contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that,' Maurice said in the New York Post last Friday, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple refrained from the accusation that she was a racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they were afraid that by offending her they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", her husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children with someone who had offended you, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Stop it.
Comparing the lawsuit to "blackmail", Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was "in a very difficult situation".
"You're going to prosecute someone like that?
That's not very nice,' the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to capitulate to the couple on social media, where they are scolded for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared the public wouldn't be very interested in a talking bear, reveals newly discovered letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: 'It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it's very entertaining".
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the British broadcaster BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication felt "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very prominent member of the family", she said her father was secretly proud of the eventual success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man".
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost seemed like a child's achievement; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington about that way.
Though Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for the success".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was not expected to make it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together again soon.
I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly wore off and left her body.
She had died some time before and this process shut everything down.
I could only sit there, knowing what was happening.
I could not whine, scream, or cry, for I was in the midst of all kinds of people and families.
I had to keep it real big".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea of the ordeal she was about to undergo.
"No one knew", she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women stick messages on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide, they become strong to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys stick inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at age 18.
'I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,' she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
It was said that his smile lit up every room".
Yet he stopped working before he died because he was deep in the pit.'
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Do not keep silent - talk about it".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling gloomy or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all over the floor on Christmas Day - when the kids unwrapped their presents he didn't look at them or anything.'
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that they had to deal with it: 'It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI investigates.
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asked for, an inquiry limited in time and scope, we might be able to create some more unity,' Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was 'falling apart' amid a firmly entrenched stalemate within the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their efforts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the land will be severely hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and that's how he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes the report?
Then there's a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to cast the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers are the main factors behind the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where it is easier to cross than in the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they discussed the stagnating denuclearization negotiations.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed in broad terms to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of the lack of progress in lifting the U.S. sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,' Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and finds him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes nearly screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats", Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I can say this about that, if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he's now serving", Pelosi declared.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh evaded questions about reviewing certain Supreme Court decisions during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to cheer when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court", Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit to this.
It's a righteous tirade of months and years of accumulated anger that drains, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We'll cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere who told me that she would cry when she got angry, and she developed a method where every time she got angry, she would cry, and she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant".
Tears are partly permissible as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best memories from a previous job, in a male-dominated office, is when I was crying my eyes out because I was so angry, and an older woman, a cold company manager that everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy to have you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat-eating' or 'monkey-trapping') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she should not run.
"It was not a well-considered decision", she told me 30 years later, smiling.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind on fundraising, so she solemnly promised not to participate unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who were going to give men $1,000, were going to give her only $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign after all, she was so overwhelmed with feelings -- of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration that the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of representatives, and anger about sexism -- that she choked on it.
'I must have been thought to have had a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs Schroeder of the media's reaction to her.
"They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my headstone?
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war could turn out for Beijing
The opening salvos of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, experts say a rift between the two countries could be a long-term win for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was revealed this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unveiled on $200 billion in goods; half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has taken retaliatory measures in kind each time, most recently raising tariffs from 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to match the United States every time, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to blink its eyes any time soon.
To make Washington bow, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the United States is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US could support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could send either country into economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously recognized", says Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues focused on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to let refugees return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in his country were improving.
'Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he says.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still some six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional assistance or aid from countries that had subsidized the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course southwest of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six straight times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the required 14.5 points to beat the USA.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, dropped his long shot from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, conceding his loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off by the European team's lowest scorer, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest-ranked player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter of Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
Spanishman Segrio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, became the best European player of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry so quickly, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I could help,' said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods by two holes down and one hole to go in the singles game on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel for beating Tiger Woods, I've been following that guy all my life growing up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairways over the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
For a short time this morning we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
We're gonna regroup, and I'm gonna work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to the opponent.
We've been cheated".
Red glow update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties.
