Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that she looks like a doll.
Some Members of the Assembly have waited on the proposal to change their name to MWP (Latin: Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This relates to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could be politically ridiculous.
One Labour member said his faction was concerned because it was in conflict with the Labour Party and the Labour Party.
Not for Welsh readers: in Welsh twp means kwilil and pwp means ka.
The Member of the Assembly said that the whole faction was unconvinced and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative claimed that his faction was open to the name change, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to λλου.
For the letter w is spoken in the same way as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly committee, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the name, said: 'The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will of course be the members' own affairs.
The Welsh Assembly was created by the Welsh Government Act 2017 to change its name.
In June the Commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals which received strong support for the Assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the most support was given to the MWP during the public consultations.
The Assembly members clearly offer alternative options, but the effort to reach an agreement could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The legal acts on reforms shall include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and a plan for the committee system.
During the legislative debate, the members of the Assembly shall have a decisive vote on the question of their name.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia on Sunday.
The global vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the plebiscite over the name change, Macedonian President George Ivanov said the vote would be ignored.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
During Harlem's trouble, the names of St. Martin and other churches fell
"The old people I spoke to said that historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
 There are no other ones today.
He said it was understandable why the bar was gone.
He said that people communicate differently today.
 The bar is no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.
When he talks about churches, he worries that the money from selling property won't last as long as the leaders hope, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced with multi-unit cooperative apartments with people who would not help alongside the remaining shrines.
"The majority of people who buy cooperative apartments in these multi-family homes will be white", he said, "and therefore will accelerate the moment when churches close down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built in 1870 by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis in the metropolitan community, and St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation emerged in the 1940's.
A nearby black congregation organized a worship service and named the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by the Congregation of the Black People, led by John Howard Johnson, a clergyman who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street in the main Harlem store, which denied black people employment or higher office.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but as the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they commissioned a carillon.
Spiritual Father David Johnson, son of the spiritual father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon the name of the poor.
Experts who have been using the carillon in July have called it a cultural 'glory' and an 'irreplaceable historical instrument'.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that this was the world's first black choir to be played by Dionisio A. Lind, who started playing the big choir at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's Church hasn't changed him to another musician.
What happened in the last few months at St. Martin's was a complex story involving architects and contractors, some of whom were called by the lay people of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
In July, the parish's governing body, which is made up of lay leaders, expressed concern to the bishopric that the bishop would try to reimburse the church for the costs, even though it did not hire architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A 13-year-old was injured by a motorcycle accident in California
Officials said a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught a shark on California's opening day of the shark harvesting season.
It was attacked just before 7 a.m. in Ensinitas, off the shores of Bright Beach.
Chad Hammell told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends went down for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and then he went down with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was excited to catch the cabbage, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, "I'm getting sick!"
I'm getting it!
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire body had been torn.
I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water: 'A shark is swimming in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was flown to San Diego's Radcliffe Children's Hospital, where he was declared in critical condition.
The kind of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, a rescuer, told the media that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the thigh.
Officials have closed the beach from Kasablado Bridge to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for security and investigation.
Giles mentioned that the area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, but most are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will take over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a universal store style beauty department with specialist consultants.
With the UK's £2.8bn beauty market continuing to grow and sales of fashion and household goods falling, the larger beauty departments will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more will be set up next year.
Investments in beauty are on the rise, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use shelves once used for televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be available in more local brand zones similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The mall is also releasing its new range of boutique make-up, most of which are vegan, increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will try out the discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second in Sale Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the desire to shop in small quantities daily at local supermarkets have led to more efforts to attract people to visit.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said that corporate retailers are increasingly looking like universal stores as retailers try to compete with cheaper retailers by offering more services than food.
Sainsbury's has included Argos retailers in hundreds of stores and has also set up a number of Habitat stores, as two years ago it acquired both networks, which are said to have increased sales of foodstuffs and their acquisition was more profitable.
An earlier attempt to revamp the mall's beauty and pharmaceutical department failed.
In the early 1990s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended in a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from the pharmacy stores in the malls.
The new strategy came about after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network for £125 million three years ago.
It was claimed that Lloyds' contribution to this plan was to add an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be willing to give advice.
Our brands are designed to meet every need and, thanks to attractive environments and convenient locations, we are now an attractive place of beauty that challenges the old buying habits.
Peter Jones is very upset that Holly Willoughby has terminated a £11m deal with him.
Peter Jones stars in the drama series The Dragons, and is back after TV presenter Holly Willoughby terminated an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business has been likened to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand name Goop.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure on her Instagram account.
Holly Willoughby, leaving a profitable lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones.
Prosecutors say Jones was upset when, during a tense meeting on Tuesday, a golden TV girl at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlou, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new deals totalling up to £1.5 million would mean she would no longer have enough time to devote her household goods and accessories to the brand Truly.
The business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was estimated to have doubled Mr Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on his Instagram account that he was leaving, Jones left the UK for one of his summer vacations.
The source said, "Truly, it's been one of Holly's top priorities so far.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave was a great surprise to everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
Marlou's headquarters has a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of The Morning Show, one of Britain's most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions of dollars for large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the fact that it will be too late to start.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, maintained close ties with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
In 2016, H. Willoughby co-founded Truly with T. Cappu, and 52-year-old P. Jones joined the fight as chairman.
The couple is on vacation together, and Mr. Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace ITV's I'm A Celebrity host Anne McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We're not going to comment on his business".
We talked hard and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism of the comments he made, which some might consider to be "Vice-President" and also for his positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so much?
The briefly speaking news anchor said:
I didn't say anything.
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was supported by a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations are on hold.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not getting an adequate response from the US over its early disarmament.
He noted that the US is instead continuing sanctions aimed at keeping pressure down.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We're in this great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the completion of missile tests, help in the release of hostages and the return of American troop supplies.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were displaced, this was not declared a national disaster  a necessary condition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been very clear that international aid is not needed, so this is a bit complicated", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Poland, it is not clear whether workers working abroad will be able to work locally.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Pal to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the effects of natural disasters.
Although tsunami relief was built in Ače, it is not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens likely increased the number of lives lost in the area despite the warning.
Traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is difficult at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok, which is treating earthquake victims, is sailing to Palos, but will arrive at the new disaster site in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen the reconstruction of the infrastructure of the destroyed Indonesia as the centre of his election campaign, spending generously on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has not given the Joko administration any peace of mind as he will run again in the next year.
Yoko is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members hold more conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim mobs fight in the streets using machetes, arrowheads, and other simple weapons.
Watch Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge score a long-distance goal in a game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League by striking out a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in London.
With their team down 1-0, Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball to former Sturridge Town about 30 metres from the Chelsea gate.
He passed the ball on his left foot and hit the far back.
The ball raised high above the penalty area flew into the upper right corner of the net.
It finally flew over the dancing Cape Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
"I was just trying to get the ball in the position, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to keep as much time as possible for the shot", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw a running back at Kent, and I hit the ball in one rain, and without thinking too much, I just threw it.
After the 25-minute kick from Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea led 1-0 from the first ball.
In that attack, the Blue Devils striker in the middle of the field returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic and rushed towards Liverpool.
This one in the middle of the square quickly hit the wall.
Then the goalkeepers sent the ball between the opponents to the penalty area for the struggling Hazard.
Hazard hit the defender and through Liverpool player Alison Becker, he hit the ball with his left foot and threw it into the net at the far end.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Italy.
Chelsea will meet with the UEFA Europa League side at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from the Indonesian tsunami now stands at 832
As the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832.
A spokesman for the agency told a news conference in Sutopo Purwo Nugroho that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which caused a 20-foot [6.5 m] wave.
Half the city, home to more than 380,000 people, was destroyed by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Berkenhead, Mercedes, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mouse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on anyone in the area who saw or heard to speak out.
Detective Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still early, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard anyone suspecting that they were contacting us.
I would also like to appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something with a video recorder and contacted us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of the Berkenhead area and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who knew the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police have reported that they are informing the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his promise when he found out what happened.
Residents are now told that they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed to return home.
One police officer was reported to have explained to one person that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene of the crime, covered in blood.
She kept saying, "It's so terrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were parked in front of the barrier on the inside, and another van was parked behind him on the outside.
Many officers were standing on the inside of the fence and watching the multi-unit block.

The statues of Cromwell in Parliament are being struck by the final blow of the debate over the rewrite of history.
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban's actions reminiscent of the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage by the fanatical Cromwell Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society described J. Crick's proposal as a travesty and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the move of the statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell at Westminster Palace was bound to become the target.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out the iconoclasm of the English Civil War.
Perhaps it is not this Cromwell who will be sacrificed for the actions of the patriarch Tom in the last century.
The stunning image of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft reflects a 19th-century view and is still considered by many to be a dignified piece of historiography.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "For many people, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, Cromwell was seen as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, and that was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is fully imagined is still debated by historians.
One thing is clear: the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became a unique figure representing one side of this tacococoir.
His success as a defender of Jehovah is also worthy of mention and praise.
A pig killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan was found dead, covered in blood from a damaged artery, lying next to a pig in Liushansai Pork Market, Guizhou Province, southern China.
On 30 May 2005 a pig farmer in Sininge, Qinghai Province, China, prepared a vaccine for pigs.
He said that on Wednesday he and his cousin from neighboring Junano province are going to the markets to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found a dead relative and found the door open to the nearby pigsty.
He said there was a big hole in the pig's mouth that was covered in blood.
As the report states, the court's examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms struck the farmer.
Guiyang Evening News quotes: My cousin's legs were bloody and injured, said the cousin, naming himself Wu, 
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up to prevent it from invading other people and kept until the police gathered evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the government of the market are negotiating death compensation.
Although rare, cases of human-eating pigs have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 200-pound pig slammed a Welsh farmer into a tractor and pressed it until his wife took the animal away.
After a pig ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told ABC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but blood tastes can trigger aggression.
They're just playful.
They like to get married, they're very curious... they're not willing to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them properly, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose are bringing heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves through the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
But in the coming days, Rose will bring heavy rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Eucene Peninsula, Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure area is beginning to form on the Pacific side, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rose approaches the California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to bring strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, the Rose will bring up to 25 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low-pressure area, will bring extensive rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Instead, between 2.5 and 10 inches [2.5 to 10 cm] of rain will result in dangerous flash floods, landslides, and possible desert landslides.
The high humidity of the tropics has caused some areas, especially southern Nevada and Arizona, to drop by between five and eight centimeters per hour.
A total of 58 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, particularly in large parts of Arizona.
The nature of the tropical rainfall has led to possible flash flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of hurricanes, it would be a particularly bad idea to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into floodwaters, and hail can cause wind and dust to gush.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to the southern California coast.
More than 1 centimetre of falls are likely to cause a small flow of debris and the roads may become slippery.
It would be the first wet season to fall in the region.
Some of the strongest tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday nights and early Monday, and then rain later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread across Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
There may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic is warming, but the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this causes huge temperature changes over small distances.
Sunday was a great example of a huge temperature difference in the central United States.
The temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, are nearly 20 degrees below those in St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The summer heat held over the next few days should rise again and cover more areas.
A warm, 27°C [27°F] temperature is expected to hit much of the central and eastern United States, from the Great Southern Plains to the northeastern regions.
New York's temperature is expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that temperatures in the eastern United States will be higher than the multi-year average in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the trial of Bret Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the eye-catching speeches of Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh and the accusations of sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford in the 1990s on six television broadcasts on Thursday.
But political blindness continued as regular broadcasters were cut off from their schedules due to Friday's last-minute change: An Arizona senator has agreed to a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was a high school prom student, robbed her and tried to strip her.
Kavanaugh testified in a bitter manner that he was absolutely certain that it was not.
Nielsen reported on Friday that the broadcast was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The accounts were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nielsen has generally some difficulties in counting people watching television in offices.
To clarify, I understand that this is an audience the size of what would happen in a fall football game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, led the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers per day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
There was considerable interest after the hearing.
The main character in Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to get in an elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
CNN filmed him directly with his eyes down when people were flooding him.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before closing the elevator, added that he would have more to say at the Judiciary Committee meeting.
Later, cable and broadcast networks discussed the matter in person when the Judiciary Committee voted in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate.
However, Flack said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the allegations made against the candidate, which the Democratic minority had called for, within the next week.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Senator Chris Coons, was partially convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flack made a decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh's failure to investigate.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister blames critics for playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the Sunday Times of her plans to leave the EU of criticism by playing politics against Britain's future and at the expense of national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson continued to challenge her so-called Brexit plan for Britain and the EU to collect tariffs on each other, saying it was "absurd".
The shooting of Waydeon Sims Police arrested the suspect, Dayton Simpson, for the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed 20-year-old LSU basketball player Waydeon Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department reports that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's fight, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the riots.
The CBS affiliate, WAFB, reports that police removed the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After Simpson was questioned, police reported that he shot and killed Wade.
His lawyer reports that his bail is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Office of Experts released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, facing the neck.
The department is distributing the proceeds to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police Department and the residents of the area who helped investigate the suspect's arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the district attorney for his bravery and justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-1 boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the junior averaged 5.6 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "cluttered and confused".
"It's all in your head", Wade said.
A volcano is burning ash in Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have erupted and reached the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after a crater activity and 183 recorded gas and ash emissions within 24 hours were recorded.
The center has observed a number of tremors and tremors.
Social media photos show a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighboring Mexico, such as Chochimilke.
Geophysicists observed that the volcano's activity increased 72 km southeast of the capital when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Before the annual independence vote, the police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote against secession.
The riot police who stopped the masked separatist group were covered in eggs and powder, causing dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The police used the bars to stop the fighting that began the next day.
Within hours, the independence group, which chants 'Unforgettable, unstoppable', met unionist protesters who shouted: 'Long live Spain!'
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but condemned by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region.
Most voters chose to become independent, but the majority of the voting was limited by the number of people who boycotted the vote and did not want to split.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police across the region tried to stop voting in electoral districts.
The pro-independence group set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but they were forced to change course.
Electrician Narcissa Termes, 68, who was taking part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about the prospects for Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best times.
I watched parents shout joyfully at those who could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a decisive and difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep pace this year as many of their most prominent leaders have either retired to a voluntary stint or are in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and later declaring independence.
Police-supporting mechanic John Puig, 42, who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
The pressure is rising, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
'Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,' he said.
London, arresting men who entered the house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they repeatedly entered a London home by car.
The incident occurred at approximately 7:30 p.m. on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car could have also been shot with a shotgun.
The Mango's hit secured a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
The first goal of the player Dolly Mengo guaranteed a victory.
Livingston's promotion to the top flight surprised the Rangers, forcing the current manager of the Ibrox club, Steven Gerrard, to lose the second of 18 games.
Dolly Meng's hit proved to be a big one, as Gary Holt's team was in a moment's notice against the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is undefeated in the Premier League this season and will meet the leaders of the Heart of the World on Sunday, eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will play their home games in the Europa League against Rapid City.
Livingston has extended their unbeaten streak of unbeaten games in the division to six, and head coach Holt hasn't felt the taste of losing since replacing Kenny Miller just last month.
Livingston missed his chances at a game with a few guests.
Even before the Holt team was knocked down for their endurance, which caused the Rangers to face various problems, it had long been ahead.
At first Scott Robinson broke through and hit the butcher's door, then Alan Lithgow slipped and couldn't reach Craig Hallett's head and he stopped by the door.
The hosts, allowing Rangers to play in the front, were not worried because they knew they could cause trouble for guests by creating standard positions.
That's how the decisive blow was struck.
The Rangers lost the free kick and Livingston started to race forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to pass the ball to Menag, who stopped it and won a penalty kick from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the Rangers have been in control of the ball for a long time, but the owners' defense has been ineffective and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly has had almost no job.
That game continued in the second half, though Kelly had to work hard to get Alfred Morelos to the gate.
Scott Pittman's shot was taken by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor in the leg, and the second live-to-stand Lithgow shot was fired near the gate.
The ball was always in Livingston's penalty area during the transfer, but was always blown out, with two demands for the penalty being met, one for Hallett's encounter with Glenn Middleton, who had run away from the bench after the transfer and the other for the rain of the ball.
Analysis of the phenomenal appearance of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from the Tony MacArony Arena
A phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
They were all great, one by one, and they continued to exceed expectations for the game that was improving.
The style of play and staff have changed little since he returned to the top flight, but the big profits are worth giving to Holt, who has been burning the team.
He's got a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played well, concentrating on a well-organized defense, and Meng helped Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall stay awake.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
While they're playing well under Gerrard, this time they're missing a lot to reach their level.
They scored few decisive hits and only one run through the hosts' defense, a certain alarm call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was met in various ways in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there was a smile and blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to try to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kelen to open a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police banned 25,000 people from crowding outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdish, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him in their country.
Various protests have shown a split among visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others flatter him and call him a dictator.
Motorcycle accident in Deptford, death of a motorcyclist
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford Road, southeast of town, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, hit by a convicted felon who then escaped.
Police said officials are trying to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison, six officers injured in the blast
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured in a major riot at the men's prison.
The break-in took place at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30am local time, where it remains.
Special Tornad officials have been called in to handle the robbery, which involves eight inmates and takes place in one prison wing.
Officers are treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "In an effort to control the ongoing incident, HMP Long Lartin's prison has been called for specially trained prison staff.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we ensure that those responsible are turned over to the police and, possibly, spent longer periods behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police officers were called to the prison to handle a serious riot in which some staff were beaten with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its flash floods (which may be beneficial for the surrounding areas)
It's not uncommon for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rose, with its remaining energy, hits the desert southwest, causing a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already announced flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading south and east to Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
As the rain approaches on Monday night, it is expected that Rose will be drawn directly to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Weather Service noted that only about 50 tornadoes have maintained the status of a tropical storm or a tropical depression no further than 50 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that struck the state of Arizona, about 40 miles [64 km] from the border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict that 510 centimeters of precipitation will fall, and that some areas of Arizona's Mogollon Rim will have a 5 centimeter drop.
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have a drop of between two and a half and five inches [2.5 to 5 cm], with falls reaching up to 10 inches [10 cm] in some places.
For people who are not affected by flash floods, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing, as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a serious problem, some may benefit from these falls, as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Monitoring Center, slightly more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very severe drought, which ranks as the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rose is heading for the coastline across the California peninsula, which is part of Mexico.
On Sunday, the still-originally named storm, Rosa, with maximum sustained winds of 137 km/h (619 miles) was 619 kilometers (620 miles) south of the Eucene Peninsula, Mexico, and was moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is experiencing wetter waters in the Pacific region and is therefore severe.
So it is expected to reach the Mexican coast with hurricane force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Falls in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
From the California peninsula to northwestern Sonora, the rainfall is expected to reach 815 centimeters, but it is possible to drop as much as 25 centimeters, weather.com reported.
Then Rose will pull north through Mexico like a hurricane, then, Tuesday morning, it will reach the Arizona border like a tropical depression, and Tuesday night, it will pull south through Arizona to Utah.
"The primary threat expected from Rose or her remains is heavy rainfall in the California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. Desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause sudden floods, landslides in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas that are dangerous to life.
Attack on Midsomer North, four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Midsamer Norton Excelsior terrace area at approximately 04:00 local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Police in Avon and Somerset have reported that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock area on the night.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh was upset by the D.C.'s crap, anger.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said in his speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been very angry about the demons of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday that the strongly and emotionally negative accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said Americans saw Kavanaugh that day, how cool, noble and brave.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a solid reputation in public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's candidacy, while also highlighting the importance of Republican campaign activity in the midterm elections.
We have five weeks to go before the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not participating, although I'm actually participating, he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere".
Trump said the Democrats were trying to resist and block.
A senior GOP aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination should be held no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Authorities reported at least 384 deaths, many of them devastated by massive waves hitting the coastline when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter-high wave began to submerge the shore in the dark, killing many and destroying everything that happened along the way.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run away, so they became victims", BNPB, Indonesia's disaster relief agency, told the press during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not strike alone, it pulled cars, poles, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that before it hit the coast, the open sea was flying at 800 km/h.
He said some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Paul centres.
Aerial images from the Emergency Management Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges flooded and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by repeated attacks.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported that the energy released during the particularly strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The tsunami may have been exacerbated by the city's geographical location, as it was located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "big", and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast, 300 km north of Palau, in a region called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communications networks had been completely paralyzed, so no information was received from Dongal.
There are more than 300 000 people living there, said a Red Cross spokesman in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were moving to the disaster areas.
It was said that the situation could be considered a tragedy but could worsen.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting the tsunami hit Paul, although officials said the waves came after a warning was issued.
A man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting about an approaching tsunami to people standing down the street.
Within minutes, a water wall breaks down on the shore, sweeping buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami interrupted the electricity supply, disconnecting the communications networks around Palos and making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the delivery of aid.
Authorities said that while the army from Jakarta and other cities has started sending cargo planes with relief supplies, the evacuated person is still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city was reopened only for the purpose of providing aid and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the Paul evacuation centres on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
This is very bad.
Doseba reported that while World Vision personnel from Dongla were safely travelling to the city of Pallu, where staff were clinging to the uncluttered tents in the office yard, the images were destroyed along the way.
She told me she saw a lot of houses destroyed, he said.
This is very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take complex steps to provide relief in the disaster, some people complained that experienced foreign aid workers were banned from traveling to Palma.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and foreign staff can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 When the government says, Yes, this is a national disaster, we can call for international assistance, but that status has not yet been announced.
On the night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and loved ones of missing people were hoping that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would shape the bleak history of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled from the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been crushed for two days by the rubble next to her mother's body.
Indonesia's national paratroopers' coach Gendon Subandono has trained the two missing Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, to paratroopers.
Others trapped at the Ro Roa Roa Hotel, including Monday, were his students.
"Because I'm older in the sport of parachuting, I carry my emotional burden", he said.
Gendon briefly told how within hours of the announcement of the collapse of the Ro Ro Ro Ro Hotel, the news reached the skiing community, and he desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app Paul to the contestants at the beach festival.
But his messages contained only one grey, not two blue rings.
I think that means the message wasn't received, he said.
A bank robber filled an ATM at the Newport on the Levee stole $26,750.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled an ATM at the Newport on the Levee Entertainment Center on Friday morning.
"The driver of the car was holding a cash machine in the entertainment complex and was willing to add more money", Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man ran off behind the back of a Brink's employee and stole a purse of money to fill.
According to the press release, witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Any person with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the changes to his Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: "The man formerly known as Kanye West".
41-year-old West, known for some time as Ye, named his eighth album after the name, which was released in June.
The change began before the show Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He has to replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
It's not just a shortened version of the current professional name -- K. West has said earlier that the word has religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means tu, which K. West said earlier this year, talking about the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the one, and it became just Ye, which means our good, bad, confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Bigdy or Bigdy, but this year he announced the preference for the names Love and Brotherly Love.
Former West's colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a brooch and in capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obradoras (abbreviated AMLO) has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday in Tlatelolco that he would never use military force to disperse the Mexican population.
On October 2, 1968, at the same time as left-wing student movements swept Latin America, military forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has made a proud pledge to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student grants and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal groups.
The US should double funding for AI
"As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field", says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government agencies published reports on artificial intelligence, even after the U.S. had no official AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China last year presented its plan to lead AI innovation by 2030.
An increased AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are ahead of the US and are expected to make another breakthrough in AI, said Lee.
The double funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI achievement will be in the US, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, an investment firm in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1990s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked with an AI system that beat the top American Othello player, and later served as Microsoft Research's CEO and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's "Robotics Challenge", and asked when the next one would be, to help find more intelligent people.
Lee said that US scientists often have to struggle to win state grants.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US strengthen efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its New Generation AI Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, the National Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies donate money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced an investment of about US$2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, in recent months, nothing has been done about the US legislation that aims to create a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name refers to a claim to Greek territory and vetoes Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but opponents of the nationalist movement say the name change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether voter turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to take effect.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership in favour of an agreement with Greece?'
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
Today I am here to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said 79-year-old Oliver Georgijevacka in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will keep the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A change of title would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no violations had been reported as of 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% voted.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said Gose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonia's parliamentarian Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum on changing the country's name to open the way to NATO and the European Union.
Standing in front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov staged a small stage and pulled chairs in front of tents erected by boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not go through the servant door", Kavadarkov said.
 We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership of Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent, will attract much needed investment.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaeva said after giving his voice.
He said the result would be to secure our future.
According to the poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, 3043 percent of voters should participate in the referendum  less than the required voter turnout.
According to another poll by Macedonian television Telma, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, 50% of the electorate plus one vote must participate.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-government policy since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero defeats all of Brighton's defenses and wins
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton defence, and Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's 65th minute shot seemed incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
Before he was forced into the open, he jumped between three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players in green shirts.
He's been through one defender before, bypassing a few others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he passed the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with a single spin from the penalty area and he hit the right foot and threw the ball into the right side of the gate grid, beating Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
Aguero has foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We said he'd play 55 to 60 minutes.
Here's how it was.
We were lucky to have him win the trophy that moment.
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues to their first ever Premier League title.
The score is tied at 29.
Aguero was in the depths of Brighton Field when he was attacked.
He handed the ball to Leroy Sane on the left side of the field between two opponents.
Sanny pushed the ball forward with several spurs, while Sterling ran toward the next turn.
The Sky Blues striker hit the ball to the gate just before he slipped out of the field.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 pm, City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a friendly against the Rockies.
After the National team dropped out of the relegation play-offs, there were no more grounds for forcing the weights back.
Scherzer, a competitive player, hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the playoffs; they're one point behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, have at least secured a chance at a trip to the big leagues, but they still have to fight to win the division.
Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the court knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will be gathering, will probably be the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you move?
The starting line-up for Sunday's match has not yet been announced, but they are clearly willing to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the lineup for this match, has a throwing practice on Thursday and will take his usual position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander's stats for the season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 carries for 220 2/3 innings.
Trump speaks a language in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voter activity in the midterm elections, the President indirectly mentions the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Everything we've accomplished will be put on the scales in November.
We have five weeks until the most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I don't run... but I do run, which is why I fight for the best candidates everywhere, he said.
And then he went on, "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see how it's happening right now.
And they're determined to get back in power by whatever means you can see, it's low, it's evil.
They don't care what they hurt, what they went through to gain power and control; this is what they really want -- power and control -- but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to resist and stop.
And you see that the last four days, he's been talking about calling Democrats angry, ugly, low-key, and unfair people.
He referred the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and this drew a huge audience ovation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, um, how.
No, um... no, I'm expecting one. It was really bad body language.
Labour has lost the diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate openly speaking
When the momentum activists in my local party voted against my confidence, I wonder if it was surprising.
Finally, I am the latest Labour MP to be told I am unwanted, and that's for my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was threatened with similar things because she was firmly against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed by criticism of me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It's ironic about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and the kind of issues Jeremy didn't agree with his predecessors.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we would like to see more members attending the meetings and that the meetings are productive.
For most of the eight years I've been a local Labour MP, this is what the GC meetings on Friday nights were like.
It is sad that today many meetings are not in the same tone and that the promises of dirtier, more pleasant policies have long been forgotten, even if they have been implemented at all.
It is increasingly clear that any difference of opinion within the Labour Party is intolerable and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues, who I thought had similar political views, began to expect me to turn a 180-degree angle and hold opinions that I never agreed with, either for national security or for the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly, and no matter what, on social media, they're constantly looking for insults to promote my resignation, denouncing the Centre's policies and saying I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I've been much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I'm getting are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the harshness of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most frustrating things about this political era is how abuse has become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn last week said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are not a party of the same views, and with every change in the confidence procedure or electoral system this party is getting smaller and smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years about not jumping, not talking so loud, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not what I came into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect, which in a sense has led to the collapse of my entire school class, I have sought to provide better public services to those who need them most  either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political views and disagreements with current leaders in the area.
To those who encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have for my constituents, the members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of resignation or political correctness will prevent me from acting in my convictions and in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
38:17 Not in operation
Two late attempts have distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayrton has earned this moment of triumph in the impressive promise of the Tennent's Premiership Day.
Now the team is at the top of the table. The only one left out.
Finally, they were rewarded with a perfect defense and a good opportunity, so coach Peter Murchie can truly feel content.
"We've taken all the tests in all the games we've played so far, and we're still not done, so I'm really happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The air was good, the players took their chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, which Frazier Clima successfully completed, led the A's forward, but the yellow card for Scottish winger Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers and Baggot to stop the unsuccessful attempt.
The climb increased the penalty advantage of the team by gaining points and finishing the personal test successfully in the middle of the race, helping the team to improve to 17:5 before the break.
However, Melrose's second leg started well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer period as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was knocked out of the game on the bench.
Captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose tried to take advantage of the players' surplus, but Bruce Colvin's attempt to overcome the intense pressure was unsuccessful.
The home team player returned, however, after receiving a yellow card for stopping Clem without a ball, MacPherson hit the ball from the penalty line for the remaining A-Line foul.
Clima successfully completed his test, as he had done almost since the start of the matchup, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong's spike in the corner of the field and prevented quarterback Gregor Henry from making his fifth home team try for points.
Still Game's star, apparently ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems poised to make the move to the housing and catering industry after being named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, writes and stars alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's final season, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Craigslist.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although Scottish Sun sources said Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
Bolivia's land captive hopes that the court will reopen the sea
The Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The flag of the blue sea is flown on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the slogan: "We have the right to own the sea".
It's our duty to get her back.
In all of landlocked Bolivia, memories of access to the ocean sacrificed to Chile in the 19th century's bloody resource conflict are still alive and long, and the Pacific Ocean is once again bursting with life.
The hopes that have been raised in recent decades have now been particularly strong, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
'Bolivia is committed to a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes for positive results,' said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will watch the ICC ruling on the big screen, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia's complaint  Chile will be forced to negotiate the Bolivian state's access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian Indian president facing a controversial re-election campaign, is also keenly interested in Monday's decision.
We are very close to the possibility of returning to the Pacific Ocean, he promised, by the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to think that a court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely, even if it were, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to draw up a landmark for Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ICC decision will be published only six months after the last arguments have been heard does not indicate that the case has not been complicated, said Paz Zárate, an expert on international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia did push back, the last four years could have pushed it back.
The issue of illegal access to the sea was raised by the current Bolivian administration, said Zarate.
She believes that any remnants of Chile's goodwill were destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but after all this, it will be very difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the view that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
He said that on Monday, Bolivia will have the unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of dispute for mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales was still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, and used the issue of the sea as a political manipulation.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Deciding is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile with the past.
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is possible only if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has assured his people that they will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on its pledges, which the leaders of the competing countries agreed at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently was about to resume a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the ultimate dream is that if sanctions continue and the United States declines to declare the end of the Korean War, North Korea could be hidden someday.
Washington will avoid approving the declaration unless Pyongyang takes convincing disarmament action first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is not seriously planning to abandon the arsenal that the country seems to see as its only security guarantee.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they'll quickly take over the nearest fashion stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne introduced a wide range of eccentrically large headgear in their spring and summer 2019 collections, and it just hit the streets of Paris Fashion Week with its style.
These particularly impractical hats took over the social networking site Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The most striking feature of Valentine's work was a huge body-colored hat, decorated with a wide, feathered border that encircled the head of the model.
Other non-standard size accessories were jewels to decorate with a bow tie, a witch hat and even a pineapple but they were not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of weird masks at the same time to Helvin.
Many of the colorful masks were lipstick and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a cloak suit with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other looked like a melting ice sheet.
And if you follow this trend of huge fashion sizes, you're not going to ask.
Fashion experts speculate that these huge linen can reach the stores.
The big hats were popular with the high-heeled La Bomba, and the straw hat with two-legged sides was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand, which has created extremely impractical hats that have taken over all social networks, has released another huge piece on the podium, a straw beach bag, almost the size of a model wearing a swimsuit.
The red brick raffin bags, decorated with raffin shells and a white leather hand, became the highlight of the La Riviera SS19 Paris Fashion Week in Jacquemuse's collection.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think next summer there's going to be huge hats and beach bags in stores because the designer has made such an impact, so it's hard to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories".
John Edward: 'Speech skills' are a vital skill for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have improved academic achievement records, not including in 2018, and demonstrated exceptional test results, which have only been further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other community achievements.
With a total of over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to become global citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can develop and implement the intended school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are being eagerly selected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you can talk to a person in a language they understand, they will understand you by your mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.
It's a strong reminder that we can't just speak English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
And from the results of the recent exams this year, we can say that languages are at the peak of their popularity and they have the best maintainability ratings in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A-score.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of pupils received the highest A score on the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent of those who learned German received the highest A score, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish received the highest A score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider learning foreign languages an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as an optional subject is now considered as important in independent school curricula and elsewhere as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The UK Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 found that 17% of employers had insufficient language skills for all the reasons why they were finding it difficult to fill jobs.
Therefore, speaking skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
As the future of employment will depend heavily on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globally changing world.
No matter what career a person chooses in learning a second language, he or she will be far superior to others in the future if he or she has the skills needed for life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will make a multilingual person much more competitive.
According to a 2013 survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to participate in a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a bilingual percentage of the population, or 15%.
That is why it is important for today's children to invest in language learning.
Learning several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children better opportunities to gain meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the language it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be of great importance to the UK for the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are ready to create an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need for the future.
There is no denying that in today's global business environment languages remain vital for the future of the country and that this must be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and outcomes to Scottish youth.
It's a must.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council for Scotland
LeBron is making his debut Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego.
Fans are looking forward to LeBron James' season opener with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes you'll be playing is still unclear.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans for the Lakers for six preseason games.
At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to get ready, he said.
A short speech in West Virginia, on a YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump speeches scheduled for next week, including a stopover in friendly areas like Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting to approve the suspension of the nomination process for the Supreme Court of his choice, Trump is seeking to focus support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans face a threat of losing control of Congress in the November vote.
At what time is Trump's speech in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
A short speech in Willingdon, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the short speech in West Virginia online on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to touch on this week's topics of Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, as she has been under a lot of strain over suspicions of sexual misconduct when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination until a week before the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this campaign is to help the Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
President Trump's campaign therefore argues that the goal of the five meetings next week, as reported by Reuters, is to energize volunteers and supporters who are trying to protect and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and House.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the very hot campaign season begins", a spokesman for Trump's campaign said, declining to reveal his name.
The talk planned for tonight at the Westbank Arena in Wyoming should draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring Pittsburgh media attention, according to West Virginia's Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, a state that won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate nominee, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is ranked low in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president had to come in to push him to the top", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: US team fighting for entry into Sunday's unit race
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the quarter-finals could be just what we needed for this Ryder Cup.
This kind of success is completely fabricated, but players really believe that, especially in contests like this.
So whose side is success now?
She led by six points, and now by four, so I guess we can call it that much of a success", Jordan Spieth said in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe leads, with a four-point lead and 12 games to go.
The American enthusiasm, Spieth says, is overwhelming, and they're not lacking, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was unstoppable from start to finish and led impeccably.
As the round progressed, the wild victory rallies continued to grow, and in the fourth game, Thomas scored two points out of two possible.
His hit, earned by them in this game in the 15th hole, was healed by similar slogans that seemed to say that the American team was not finished yet.
"You just have to focus and focus on your games", Spieth said.
Now each of these players have to play separately.
18 dips to the successful end.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange, but charming couple from Europe have scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Mollywood was the only couple that didn't need extra hits not only on Saturday afternoon, but also Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
The pace of events and the reaction of the thrilled spectators only confirm that they will be the winners on Sunday, and that no one else will achieve the popularity of Fleetwood or Molinari, who, after the last rays of sunshine have come down the field at Le Golf National, have a chance to secure a European victory.
It would be nice to be in different caves at the same time.
Although it's too early to talk about European fame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, the Eastern Four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The extra hit and the two double extra hits in the first nine-pointer series got the Spanish and Swedes in trouble, and they never got out of it.
But on Sunday, no one will get out of trouble.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the fact that the strategy can change more quickly.
Europe played better as a team, so they took a decisive lead in the final, but this fourth stage also showed that the US team has a fighting back that some, especially in the states, questioned.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 10:6
Europe will meet on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a heavy weight, ahead of the United States in the quarter-final on Saturday with a 10-6 lead.
The inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario duo continued to change the atmosphere with two wins to the hard-fought Tiger Woods and a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who were trying to keep the trophies they lost two years ago to Hazeltine, dominated the fourth game of the morning against the unsuccessful American side and finished the stage with a score of 3:1.
The United States showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games but failing to overcome the points gap.
They need eight points from Sunday's 12th inning to keep the trophy in their hands.
Fleetwood are the first European rookie to score four consecutive points in a double with Molinario in the Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to score four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they unmistakably broke the confidence of losing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better 5-4 record.
Woods, who had won two games on Saturday, at times showing a high level of professionalism, had already lost 19 and 29 of his four games, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose took a break in the morning's fours and returned to play partner Henry Stenson in the fours, who beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk, who finished first and third in the world rankings, 2&1 and 2&1 respectively.
On a pleasant, gentle day in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not in a hurry.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have led the American team to two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they scored an easy 2-1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in the fourth match they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3, without knocking the ball out in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have teams managed to get up four points from one another in a single match, although half of the Fury would have had enough to keep the trophy.
Although they were in second place for two days, their success on Sunday seemed to have fallen.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally arm itself in any way without trusting
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization General Assembly that North Korea had taken significant goodwill measures over the past year, including halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test base and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we didn't get any response from the US, which he regretted.
Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally arm the former.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's previous complaints about Washington's opposition to a phased approach to nuclear disarmament to reward North Korea for its phased actions, his statement stood out for not completely rejecting the idea of bilateral disarmament as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri recalled a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to ease the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States demands nuclear disarmament first and is increasing sanctions pressure to achieve its goal by forceful means, even by rejecting an end-of-war declaration, Ri said.
To think that we can be covered by sanctions is the same as walking around with utopian dreams for people we don't care about.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting, which the US leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If the other country on the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have been the subject of such an obsession".
However, Ri's tone of voice has changed dramatically from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when President Trump called Kim a missile mastermind who was planning a suicide mission, it was entirely inevitable that North Korea's missile would be launched into the United States.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to wipe out North Korea, paid tribute to Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea meets its nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timetable for that, and he said that if it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the sanctions must be continued with no concessions until the full evidence-based nuclear disarmament is achieved.
The Security Council voted unanimously in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri behind the scenes of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to pave the way for another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that all progress was just for North Korea to announce within hours that it had submitted gangster claims.
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, pledged to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He said Kim said the appropriate measures he sought were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he would seek to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to get more sleep in order to combat the growing cat culture in the study of caffeine and sleep deprivation.
One scholar found that students at the best universities in the world often do not even have the basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham City, a specialist in women's hospitals, developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for this course came after a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only being told this now, my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
This is the first year that the course is being offered, and it shows students how quality sleep is key to achieving academic and athletic achievement and improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Department of Health Services, said the university decided to offer the course after it became clear that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course shall include a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a photo of the living room where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, exercise kits and books to learn about caffeine, the effects of light, how sleep deprivation affects performance and how important a sleep routine is.
In another section, participants learned how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Map of the student campus with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We understand that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking, just as you do, explains Professor Chesler.
He said that the culture of pride in not sleeping at night still exists, and modern technology and the increasing pressure on students has led to a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
To ensure adequate and quality sleep, students should be a secret weapon for fighting stress, dizziness and anxiety,  he said,  even while avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep transfers the brain to hunger mode, so students are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology from California, helped Professor Cheesler prepare a course when he attended one of his classrooms last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to apply for a course available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all secondary students to listen to this course before they start attending this competitive institution.
Professor Chesler advised students to set a bedtime alarm, just like a wake, and to guard against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and light-emitting diodes, which can upset your circadian rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
The gang's rambling has upset Gerrard's men.
The Rangers suffered another disappointment when Dolly Menag Livingstone beat Steven Gerrard's weakened score 1-0.
The Ibrox were hoping to win their first outing after a 4-1 victory in February against St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard for a second time in 18 games and now the latter team are eight points behind the previously absent premiership leader Heart.
Meng struck with seven minutes left to play, but without inspiration, the Rangers failed to match.
Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston are up to third and only one lap behind Hibernian.
And the Rangers' concern doesn't end there, because the most likely thing from the tribunes' oil hit the head of the sidekick, Calum Spence, and injured him.
Gerrard made four changes which led to the FA Cup semi-final.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same nun who took the point from Heart last week, and he would have trusted how his well-thought-out combinations had gathered opponents at every turn.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They could have killed him as soon as the second minute of the second round, when Meng gave the ball to the attacking Scott Pittman of Allan McGregor, but safety ruined his chances by turning the ball away from the gate.
After a long distance, Keegan Jacobs' free kick hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate, defensive back Alan Lithgow, pulled through.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was all about hope, not belief in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a fine when he confronted Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson denied the Columbia lawsuit.
The Rangers only managed to hit him twice in the first innings, but former Ibrox pitcher Liam Kelly was hardly scared by a blow to the head by Lassana Coulibaly or the gentle twitching of Ovie Ejaria.
While the 34th-minute kick may not have been a match-up, no one can argue that they deserved it for their efforts.
The Rangers have failed to overcome Jacobs's flawed defense again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and handed the ball to Menag for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action to change Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and that change paid off almost immediately as Homeland Security played Morelos, but Kelly's impressive play withdrew the blow.
Livingston has brought his guests into a game they've enjoyed with the remote transfer of the Lithgow and Halkett balls.
Holt's team could have increased their perimeter in the end, but McGregor defended himself from Jacobs' blow after Lithgow fell from the corner.
After a change to the field, Rangers player Glenn Middleton again appealed the penalty at the end of the game after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned him down.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today is 136 years ago and many more... that day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, the device later known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a worldwide hit in science and later in popular culture, with the 1950 film Bells of Coronado starring cowboy-like scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these ears on, you can actually hear how atoms touch the radioactive minerals.
- Hey, it's really shooting now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named after him is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill bad cells
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognize bad cells  this is part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their exchange in the laboratory
Then the cells can pick up proteins from many cancers and then inject them back into the body.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with various cancers.
One woman, who was given this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see the proteins that are typical of HER2 cancers and then inject them back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon,  explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are extracted from patients and trained to adapt to cancer cells, has been successfully applied to the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West released a Trump-backed track in a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It's not over yet.
After the unreleased performance of Saturday Night Live, the studio audience embarrassed Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, for claiming to be a part of the 2020 campaign.
That night, after performing the third song, "Ghost Town", in which he wore a hat with the tagline "Make America Great", he continued to denounce the Democrats and voiced support for Trump.
How many times have I talked to white people, they've said, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if racism were a concern for me, I would have left America a long time ago, he explained.
The SNL show began with a comedy scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual misconduct allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's replicas was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to get West off this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had some discomfort in the back of his head due to the headgear.
She was laughing at me in the back.
He said not to go there with a hat like that.
They were laughing at me!
They said I got to the bottom, and he laughed at the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what the bottom is?" He asked. "I'm wearing my superman hat, and that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start loving each other.
His remarks caused at least two uncompromising shouts in the audience and the members of SNL appeared embarrassed, as Variety reports.
West was called in to replace singer Arian Grande, who had died a few days earlier.
West is making a lot of noise with his performance of "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
He was supported by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, who posted on her Twitter account, "We're the bravest man in the world: A MINI'S AGAINS TO BE DISCHANGED".
But talk show host Karen Hunter posted a post on her Twitter account that West was just a self-made man, and that's incredibly amazing.
But I am NOT choosing a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his identity) whose beliefs are a toxic ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free, she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on his Twitter account that he had changed his name and is now officially known as Kanye West.
He's not the first developer to change his name, but he's been following the same path that Bigdy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Bigdy, has been following.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lion; the music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in a knife attack on a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Balihakam.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Star of the Civil War Another Harington criticizes the distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington is famous as the sword-wielding character John Snow in the HBO fantasy adventure series The Stone Wars of the Middle Ages.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of a cat hero, saying that such roles often make young boys feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought the word was wrong and raised the question of how to combat the distorted masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married fellow Star Wars star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that the subject had a strong bearing on him.
I feel that this is a very important topic for me right now. Where did we make the mistake of cultivating masculinity?
What do we teach our grown men to face these problems?
Another believes that television may be responsible for this wave of male distortion, in part because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born, and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on television or on the street that makes young people feel that they should be such a man?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Obviously, we made a mistake with the young men somewhere.
In an interview, he also confirmed that he would not participate in any prehistoric or continuing Star Wars events when the series ends next summer, and said that he had had enough of battlefields and horses.
From November, the next movie in the modern-day version of Sam Shepard's True West is about a filmmaker and his brother a bandit.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him while he was building Star Wars, when he met his wife Rose.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, the show gave me a future family and a future life, he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Igritha, the love object of another character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports a 14 percent increase in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people's infections were sexually transmitted, and this is different from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the contaminated blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero, officials from China's health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized back in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the conservative values prevailing in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Most cases of infection are due to improper protection measures through such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as a way to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff stole the Republican senator's data, condemns dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that one of her staff members had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat believes the allegations were made by far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and once again a vile lie", Waters said on his Twitter account.
The disclosures were reported to include the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information went online Thursday, unknown to the Capitol Hill press, as Senate officials were investigating allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after these three senators asked questions in Kavanaugh.
Conservatory websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identified the source of these records is associated with Waters' office and that information about a Waters employee has been disclosed,  reported from the Capitol.
These unfounded suspicions are completely false and utterly false, Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false suspicions is not responsible for the leakage of this information in any way.
These unfounded suspicions are completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, as did press reports from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
This denial sounds bad, wrote Fleischer.
That means she doesn't have enough self-esteem to be a congresswoman.
If someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
He shouldn't be defending himself.
He should not question the accuser's motives.
He should be calm and humble.
Fleischer apparently tried to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is campaigning to replace Waters, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"True, if not false", he wrote.
In its statement, Waters claimed that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
We will ensure that the organisers are made clear, she continued, that they are legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all but my employees.
Comedy Johnny English is back in the spotlight with a breathtaking spy parade with Rowan Atkinson.
It's a tradition to look for Brexit in any British film, and the same thing seems to be true of the revival of the action spy comedy franchise, which began in 2003 and returned to the screen in 2011 with the comedy, The Rise of John English.
Will this sarcastic auto story about how we've obviously been getting along become a new national export opportunity?
Anyway, with his wide eyes and his rubber face, incompetent Johnny English has a second chance at bringing to the surface the unpleasant truths. The title itself clearly indicates that this comedy is aimed at non-English speaking regions of the cinema.
Of course, this stupid undercover agent who, while claiming to be a luxury, has also acquired a little of Inspector Clouseau's traits, a little bit of Mr. Byne's characteristics and a hint of the same guy's likeness that was used in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics to create the theme of the drama "Fire Trucks".
It's also a somewhat based character about a traveler and the mysterious man who created chaos that Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
There are some good moments in this latest John English movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter in a medieval suit and horses, and the rotor of a small painting hit his helmet.
Atkins' comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems to be exaggerated and oddly exaggerated, especially when serious movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible boldly infiltrate elements of comedy.
Humor is more for children than adults, and to me the unlikely adventures of John Inglis don't seem as inventive and peaceful as Atkinson's silent jokes of Mr. Bean.
The most common issue at the moment is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-attack has successfully infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and exposed all British spy identities in the area, sparking the agent's outrage over the overly minor role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's cup of a pompous, cornered character who is already suffering from a rabid political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of the character of Theresa May is pushing everything she can, but there's not much good material in the script.
The wise advisers inform her that the identities of all her agents have been revealed and that she will have to search for people among the retired.
That means you're going to have to go to the same John English, who is currently the principal of a school in some kind of a secret service, but is giving illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent.
English is sent back to Wythol to discuss the emergency and there he agrees to a long-term relationship with his colleague Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man who is involved with a submarine captain, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-class girl, seems to be underutilized.
So Betman and Robin, able to handle all matters in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet Olga Kurylenko in the fatal beauty Ophelia Buletova.
The Prime Minister is dangerously beheaded by a charismatic billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problem, the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey: they change into suitcases, they set fire to a French restaurant, they create chaos on a luxurious Volt yacht, and English starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headphones to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
All the stop-motion footage was clearly in keeping with the final series, but no matter how sweet or wild it is, it's all very much like children's television.
It's pretty average.
As with the other John English films, I couldn't get rid of the thought: the British film industry is not able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour has refused to develop a plan for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but pay for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the heads of companies to share the savings raised by the AI revolution by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy three days of weekend work and bring home the same amount of pay.
The defendant says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country forward are favourable to workers.
The shift to four working days a week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source, The Sunday Times, said: The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is in line with the Party's approach to the under-balancing of the economy for the benefit of workers and the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this view is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnellis took the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economic sphere at last week's Labour Party conference.
Mr McDonnellis said he was willing to take back power from the faceless dictators and the gun-hunters in the utilities.
Such shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not get their full share because, having seen the damage done, the Labour government can deduct something.
It also approved plans to include employees on the company's board and to set up an inclusive ownership fund to transfer 10% of the private sector companies' capital to employees and allow them to receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answering the question of whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Bret Kavanaughui has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the facts being investigated by the Bureau could influence the opinion of any Republican senator in a way that would not disturb the judge.
In an interview on Sunday's 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FBI finds out anything that would change their mind.
Senator Kennedy seems to be more liberal than his South Carolina counterpart.
Well, yes, of course, Kennedy answers.
As I said, I was on my way to the hearing, talking to Judge B. Kavanaugh.
And when that happened, when these accusations came up, I called him and I said, "Did you do that?"
He answered firmly, firmly, and unequivocally.
So it seems that no one would change L. Graham's opinion.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and we should have really shocking charges", he says.
"I don't know what was there about Dr. Ford, but I do know one thing: Brett categorically denies it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
No one she names can confirm that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will come out.
What is the World Citizens' Festival, and has it contributed to poverty reduction in any way?
This Saturday, the World Citizens Festival is an annual music event in New York City that features an impressive number of stars and aims to achieve an equally impressive goal of ending global poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the World Citizens Festival in Central Park will bring together tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also spread the message of the true purpose of the event -- to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012 as a continuation of the Global Poverty Action Project, an international mediation group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to perform a variety of tasks or activities, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise meaningfully helping raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But are the world's citizens achieving this goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert really going to convince them to demand and push for action? Is this just another example of what is called clicktivism, fictitious activism, where people think that signing an online petition or posting a tweet will really change the situation?
According to the organisers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters to promote a wide range of goals.
They say that under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced $37 billion worth of commitments and policy strategies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group also reported that the group's activities have led to 390 commitments and statements at the beginning of 2018, of which at least US$10 billion has been paid or raised.
The Group's estimates, secured by the funds, have already directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among its key commitments is the UK-based partnership between investors and developers to help children grow and reach their full potential. Following the Twitter messages of more than 4,700 global citizens, it has pledged to provide Rwandan dollars to help address the country's nutritional deficiency problem.
With the support of the UK government, supporters, national governments and people like you, citizens of the world, we can make social injustice like food insecurity a thing of the past, said Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman to a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following 5,000 requests to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the 'Food Power' project, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutritional interventions.
In your response to one of the GHGs on your website asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Citizens around the world say, "It's a long and difficult road, and sometimes we fail and fail".
But like the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will win because we are all stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and the Weeknd are some of the performers at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the US may use the Navy to blockade Russian energy exports.
"Washington can use its navy to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East", said US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Mr Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the legitimate call of the authorities, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it is doing in Eastern Europe, in Southern Europe", Mr Zinke said, with the knowledge available.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
The United States can do this with its navy, it can make sure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, it can blockade, it can make sure that its energy does not reach the market, he said.
Mr Zinke told the audience at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the US Energy Consumers' Vote.
He then compared Washington's methods with those used in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they were essentially the same.
Iran and Russia's economic alternative  find a greater or lesser resource to change fuel  he also spoke of Russia as a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements came to the attention of the Trump administration as it pursued a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin said that the strong opposition of Washington to the project was purely economic, an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position received a hostile reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its willingness to continue the project.
The main German industry organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the US to remain neutral in EU energy policy and the bilateral Berlin-Moscow agreements.
'I strongly oppose any third-country interference in our energy supply,' said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in the Holyock, Massachusetts, House of Representatives, Warren approved the consideration of the nomination.
"The women who go to Washington to run our failed government must go to the top", she said in a speech.
After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.
During a meeting at City Hall, Warren slapped President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very frightened of the way Donald Trump treats our democracy", she said.
Warren is openly critical of Trump and his proposed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said that an FBI investigation into the vote was inevitable.
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren state voters themselves believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters say a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick received the most support. 38% supported his potential candidacy, and 48% opposed.
Other discussions about the potential candidates for the Democratic Party's 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
At the Donald Trump rally, Sarah Palin talks about Trac Palin's eating disorder
Track Paulin, 26, who joined the military in September, spent a year in Iraq.
After a domestic violence incident on Monday night, he was arrested and charged.
"I see what my son is going through, what he's going through going back to his day-to-day life, so I understand other families who are suffering from a mental disorder, and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", she told the crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tallahassee, Oklahoma.
Paulin called his arrest the avoidable truth, and she said that his son and other war veterans had returned a little changed, they had returned with a harder heart, they had come back questioning whether they would receive the respect for what their fellow soldiers and lackeys and all other soldiers had given to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Vassil, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as charges of preventing a family from reporting violence while in possession of a weapon and while away, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vassil Police Department.
18 states and Colombia are opposed to the new asylum policy
The 18 states and the District of Columbia uphold the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing to provide shelter to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted amicus curiae (court counsel) comments in Washington on Friday to support the asylum-seeker policy debate, reports NBC News.
The applicant's full name is not disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy.
She says her partner and members of his criminal gang assaulted her, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many asylum applications, as states facing ongoing gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy is repealed by a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy would not change decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be taken in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and this prohibition infringes this principle, says the amicus curiae comment.
In this comment, lawyers also argue that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy and that immigrants are more likely to enter business and provide the necessary services.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges not to seek asylum for victims of domestic and gang violence.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in a policy statement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Paul, a double-digit death toll, desperately searching for survivors
The condition of the remaining survivors is deteriorating.
"The pressure is very high", says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who is calming her baby son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
The Rapid One is carrying more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting waterlogged items, and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the damaged 7.5 earthquake hospital is in a drought.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harris, who suffered back and hip fractures, were lying outside the Paul Army Hospital.
His eyes are filled with tears as he relates how he felt a powerful earthquake in the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save others.
I think I've been through the collapses of the wall", Harry told The Associated Press, adding that he came to town with his family for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, keep quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughters.
I hope she's all right.
US ambassador accuses China of intimidating propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper denying the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited the "China Daily" attachment to Des Moines Register, Iowa's most expensive paid newspaper, accusing China of interfering with the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election marks a new stage in Washington's intensifying campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to stimulate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, with both sides pushing tariffs on each other's imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese countervailing tariffs were applied to exporters from Iowa and similar states who supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China, a longtime governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and business.
In an opinion piece published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China was becoming more intentional by printing propaganda ads in the free press.
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the respected freedom of speech and press in the United States and ordered a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register", Brannstadt wrote.
Meanwhile, you won't find conflicting voices in the local Beijing press booth and you won't get a real picture reflecting the differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under the steady grip of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
Branstad also added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had withdrawn from the offer to publish his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that as the midterm elections approach, the Kavanaugh fiasco has deterred the Republican candidate
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, who has been charged with several counts of sexual harassment, analysts warned that this would receive a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The situation is very emotional and many Republicans have already officially declared their intention to vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later, Professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Mr Reeher questioned whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute call to open an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday, they will remember tomorrow and November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive think tank Movement, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, "November is coming!" During a demonstration, the Senate floor was filled with the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee voted to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the newspaper reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be lost,  said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral policy analyst for the news website.
People say she's been strong before, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen the position, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and those younger than 18-29 who, although they dislike the president, often simply do not vote.
Even before Mrs. Ford gave her public testimony when she detailed the sexual harassment charges against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts argued that if Republicans approved the nomination, it could cause outrage.
"This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steeley earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or final vote, not just whether Kavanaugh will be appointed to the bench, but how the Republicans have handled the situation and how they have handled Mr Ford", Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic campaign group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
Yet it seems that Americans still disagree on what to believe after the testimony of Kavanaugh and Ch.B. Ford, although she has a little more support.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in or are totally or partially convinced of the Ch.B. Ford show, and 35 percent say they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was indeed or likely to be lying in his testimony, and only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Under the guidance of Mr. Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Mr. Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, has testified, The Guardian reported.
Mrs. Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Ms. Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 while she was out of the plane.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party they attended while they were students at Yale University in the ninth grade.
The inventor of the messaging is planning to build a new internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is developing a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor Inrupt is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who and to what information they have access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is to take over the world.
"We have to do it now", he said of the launch.
 This is a historic moment.
Solid technology-based application allows people to create their own personal online data store  POD.
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and to what information can access it.
The company calls this empowerment of a person through data.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce Lee, an IBM-acquired security platform, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world can create their own decentralized software using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team disagreed with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
We have not asked for their permission.
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee states that the mission of Inrupt is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that helps protect the sustainability and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by founding a Science Consortium.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality in recent months.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Computer Consortium, the Computer Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I feel a great deal of optimism about this new era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vann  Victorian Cross of the First World War
On the occasion of his 100th birthday, the only Anglican clergyman to be honoured in his hometown was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant in World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann, the Reverend, earned the award on September 29, 1918, during the Battle of Belenglis and Lycyr.
Unfortunately, after four days of resistance, a sniper shot him, and he was unaware that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
During the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren unveiled the memorial stone.
One of my grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone's unveiling exactly 100 years after Grandpa won the award was a remarkable symbolism.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel led his battalion through the St. Kenton Canal, smoking highly diluted smoke, heavily firing bullets and machine guns.
He then rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward, particularly gallantly, before attacking the bat himself and killing three of his team.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "one that he will never match, but at the same time, a very inspiring thing for humility".
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vann helped to the crowning.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be part of the parade, adding: "The true hero's courage is a sign of support from many people".
MMA enthusiasts stayed up all night watching the Bellator 206 but had to settle for the Kiaulite Pepa
Imagine: you don't sleep all night to see the drying of Bellator 206, but you don't get to see the main scene.
The San Jose poster featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was broadcast live across the UK overnight on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald prepare for the fight, the UK audience is stunned by the cancelled episode "The Little Mermaid".
Some viewers were, in a way, not impressed, for it was the fight that kept them awake until dawn.
On Twitter, one of the hosts called the change to the broadcast a joke about a children's animated film called "A little bit of a joke".
As a result of the rules set by the authorities, such content was not appropriate at 6am and a programme for children had to be turned on  When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President Marketing and Communications, Bellator, replied.
Yes, my dear Pep.
The company's Bellator President, Scott Coker, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the schedules to reflect the UK audience.
When I think about repetition, I think maybe we could do it", said Coker.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't solve that until Sunday, our time, Monday, their time.
But we're already working on that.
Believe me, the change in broadcast has changed a lot of messages that weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But it's not a matter of authority.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're gonna reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, like we always do.
This is a bad situation.
Tom Daley felt insecure about his sexual orientation
Olympic water polo player Thomas Daley claims that growing up he felt inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to pursue success.
24 athletes claimed that only in elementary school did they realize they were not the same as everyone else.
The first time Lauren Laverne hosted a Radio 4 talk show, Desert Island Discs, he said he was speaking publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a father, it wasn't so important to win the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has been retired for several months because of illness.
In the first show hosted by L. Laverne, where guests are asked to imagine traveling to a deserted island, Mr. Daley said that growing up he felt inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, that sense of smallness and of being different has been the driving force behind me to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove that it was worth it so that he wouldn't let the people around him down when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT activist and, by taking part in this year's Commonwealth Games in Britain, took the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was speaking publicly about it because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences and would like to share that hope with others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the man he met in 2013 was unexpected.
Last year, Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner, but she says the age difference never caused problems.
According to T. Delay, having survived so much at such a young age  in his first Olympics he was only 14 and three years later his father died of cancer  it is hard to come to terms with someone who would be his age but have experienced the same ups and downs.
When the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Blacko-Daley's son in June, T. Daley's perspective, he says, changed completely.
If you had asked me last year, I would have said that winning the gold medal was the most important thing to me, he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robby, my Olympic gold medal.
My son's name is the same as that of my grandfather, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Antony T. Daley, whose father was unwilling to accept death, had one of his last questions: Did he buy tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch in the front row?
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't last long enough to sit in the front row", said Mr. Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only then that I finally realized that he was not unharmed", said T. Daley.
A year later, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was my life's dream to jump in the water to watch local spectators at the Olympics", he said.
It also inspired the first song selection for the show by Heather Small, who expressed her feelings about the Olympics and still graciously scratches her skin.

Dr. Mickelson, who lost his form, missed the Ryder Cup on Saturday on a pole.
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record for the Ryder Cup on Sunday, having already taken part 47 times, but he will need to improve his form significantly to avoid a failure.
Dr. Mickelson, playing for the 12th time in the biennial competition, was planted on the bench in the fourth race on Saturday by Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being in the center of action, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time major winner spent part of the day on the support team, while the rest of the day he honed his technique on the court to correct the game-sharing mistakes.
Even if he didn't play very straight at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal player in the front of the Le Gold National, where the long, rough grass is extremely unfavorable for a punch.
And if the pitch itself isn't scary enough, in Game 9 on Sunday, Mickelson will play the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, get off to a good start in the next 12 games, Mr. Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't have said it otherwise.
"He understood perfectly the role he deserved today, "he reached over my back and said with a hugged hand that he was ready to play even tomorrow", "said Furyk.
 He has no lack of self-confidence.
He's on the list of the greatest athletes of all time and he's given a lot to these teams both past and this week.
Maybe I didn't think he'd play two games.
I was thinking more, but it came out this way, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record and become the most capped athlete in the history of the Ryder Cup.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, as well as the heights of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk says his presence has also brought him intangible benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, intriguing, likes to laugh at people and is a great guy to be in a team room with", he explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, too, and it was good to watch.
It brings more than just the game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a great coup can quickly go away.
Thomas Björn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a major overhaul in the run-up to the final round of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danishman made his debut in a match in Valderamo in 1997, where the team led by captain Sevejo Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but he crossed the finish line with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"We remembered a big change in Valderamo, we had a big change in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we had a big change in Valderamo, where we won, but only a little bit", said T. Björn, who watched the 2018 show win 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the crew that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow will take all our strength.
Go and do it right.
As long as there are no points on the card, the game is not over.
We have a goal to strive for, so we must strive for it consistently.
I always said I trust those 12 players who are on our side, but we know exactly what's next for the best players in the world.
"I would not want to run away from myself in any way.
Tomorrow's going to be a whole different hair thing.
Tomorrow, the most important thing is the individual game.
It's great to play with your partner when things are going well, but when you're on the field alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
This idea needs to be put into the players' minds. Tomorrow they're gonna have to pull everything out of themselves.
Now he's gonna have to divorce his partner, and he's gonna have to pull himself together.
Unlike T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the last day's surprises, as he was on the winning team in Brooklyn until Europe survived the Miracle of Medina and turned them into losers.
"I remember every damn word", he replied, "when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 motivated his players to prepare for the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but aim for a quick start like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the acceleration occurs in one direction, the mid-fields become very tight.
We've formed our team and released the players in a way that we, you know... try to create some kind of magic tomorrow.
Thomas will have to fight back and fight Rory McIlroy in the top flight, with Paul Casey, Justin Roseanne, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter leading the way.
"I picked these guys in that order because I think they're going to win the whole game", T. Byrne said of his choice of units.
The delivery of the new German warship has been postponed again.
The newest German Navy frigate was due to enter service in 2014 and replace the Cold War war warships, but according to the local press, it will not be seen until at least next year due to the increasingly evolving systems and the high prices.
According to a military spokesman quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit, the commissioning of the main new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Rheinland-Pfalz, is now postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was clouded by the problems of combating the ship already delivered.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy as early as 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to feature powerful flares, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some classified technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracking.
Another important feature  longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest frigates to sail away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Zeit, due to endless delays, the most advanced military vessels, which are said to allow Germany to divert military power overseas, will be delayed until they enter service.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship already delivered to the builder.
The reasons for the return are not well known, but the German press has cited some essential software and hardware defects that would have made the ship unreliable on a military mission.
The software deficiencies are significant, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also appeared that the ship was too heavy  which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to implement various improvements in the future.
The 7,000 tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the entire project  alongside the technical support, including the training of the crew  is also becoming a problem.
It is claimed that it increased from an initial amount of EUR 2.2 billion to an estimated EUR 3.1 billion ($ 3.6 billion).
The latest frigate-fighting problems have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the German navy is in decline.
Earlier this year, the head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the navy was facing a real shortage of suitable ships.
The official said that the problems had arisen over time because old ships were already being written down but no replacement could be found.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret lives of the squirrels
A new study in a Scottish highland estate is trying to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide guidance for future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland is looking into the study of dwarf bats, soprano bats, red-eared bats and water-dwelling reptiles in the gardens of Wester Ross Inververver.
Special recorders will be installed in certain areas of the territory to monitor the activity of the raccoons throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests using handheld detectors.
The analysis of all sound recordings by the experts will determine the frequency of the signals transmitted by the rat and the activity of one or another species.
A map of the habitable areas and a report will then be produced to help shape the detailed picture of the behaviour of the whole landscape.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) environmental adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for the rhinos and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of residential area maintenance such as beekeeping and to identify the best ways to maintain forest areas to be suitable for lizards and other related species.
Over the past century, the population of bats has declined in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development projects that affect the transition and destroy the residential areas.
Wind and lightning, as well as mosquitoes, some chemicals used to process building materials, and domestic cats, are also threatened.
Squirrels are not actually blind.
But the ears are more helpful than the eyes to catch prey during nighttime hunting.
The locations of insects or obstacles in flight paths shall be determined by the rattlesnake using a precise echolocation method.
NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for the birds.
Ten trained experts are employed here, who regularly carry out research, recycling checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only wildlife reserve in Scotland, at Threave House in Damfrith and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten wildlife species.
The mansion's supervisor, David Thompson, says the courtyard is ideal for them.
"We have a great place for the cockroaches at Threave House", he said.
 We have old buildings, many mature trees, and a great living area.
But we don't know much about the spiders yet, so working here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
It stresses that it is essential to check for the presence of ratites before starting surveys, as accidental destruction of a single herd could result in the death of up to 400 ticks and young, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
The animals shall be protected and shall not be killed, irritated or disturbed, nor shall they be allowed to destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the head of the Scottish Squirrel Conservation Fund, urged the public to contribute to the conservation of the Squirrels.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our whales, and we don't even know what happens to many native species".
Ronaldo has denied the allegations of rape. Lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "melagians" and claimed that people were using his name to make a name for themselves.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
A Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorg in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid a woman $375,000 to cover up the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram live hours after the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "melange".
No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they're saying today is that the five-time Ballon d'Or winner lied and looked at the camera.
They want to be famous by using my name.
It's not a problem.
They want to be famous, say my name, that's part of my job.
I'm a happy person, all is well, "the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring the Der Spiegel to justice on charges they called unacceptable for allegations of publicity about private space.
Judge Christian Schertz argued that the athlete would seek compensation for moral damage in the amount of the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is alleged to have occurred in June 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Nevada Clark County Courthouse, after a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a 99% good man, betrayed by the remaining 1% of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sexual relations but claimed they were contractual.
Mayorga also claims that she had reported to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court for fear of retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to withdraw the deal because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was reportedly transferred from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the attack, and this summer signed a €100 million deal with Italian giant Juventus.
The UK would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to Secretary for Business, Greg Clark, the UK would be very sorry if it lost its position as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about the BBC's statement by the UK branch of Toyota that production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily suspended if Britain left the EU without a deal.
We need a deal, Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker claimed that a border closure would mean job losses for a no-deal Brexit.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"I think if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to shut down", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also expressed concerns about the no-deal exit from the EU and its impact on international trade.
For example, BMW claims that it will close its Mini factory one month after Brexit.
According to the automakers, the most worrying threats to the supply chain are the non-contractual Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on demand as parts are delivered to customers from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which, according to these companies, could lead to delays or a lack of details.
Toyota claimed that the Derbishir plant could not hold more than one day's supply and therefore production would be halted.
According to Clark, the Theresas May's plan for future relations with the EU is designed to avoid such border checks.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that I can say will not only make you successful today, but also take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Not only Toyota but also data from other car manufacturers indicate that the ability to continue to use the highly successful supply chain system is necessary.
Toyota could not say for what time production would be suspended, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is responsible for the meetings of the UNITED STATES, said that his union members were increasingly concerned: 'I am telling you from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have proposed a plan of objectives and conviction for future relations with the EU.
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
With the ongoing battle for a Supreme Court justice, a crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, Trump aides' ties to Russia and possible presidential interference in the administration of justice.
The question of whether Trump would release the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been a source of rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of using the 25th Amendment to remove the president.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday to await reports of his resignation.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would not release Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting where Kavanaugh testified and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, and again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox News Channel on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it could be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like the press to tell the news.
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a single White House press conference.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences are rarely held not because he dislikes TV journalists who seek audience effects.
She then noted that Trump was more likely to communicate directly with the press.
The President answers questions more often than any previous President, she said, and without providing any evidence, she added:We have reviewed these statistics.
Sanders said that a press conference would be held, but if the press had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this a lot, and you've seen it happen a lot in the last few weeks, and press conferences will change your direct communication with the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions regularly from outside the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with his distinguished guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The president's free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the press this week in New York probably explains why.
The Scottish Health Minister wrote to the EU NST staff about the concerns raised by Brexit
The Scottish Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU NHS staff expressing their country's gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector it receives.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: 'The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have been ongoing for the summer and are approaching a decision this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also started to prepare more quickly for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you're all very upset right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I value the contributions of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we would like you to stay here.
Emergency surgery for head trauma victim Christion Abercrombie
The team lost the game Saturday at 31:27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, with a head injury to Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the trauma occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side of the line and just got down there", Reed said.
The coaches and doctors at the Abercrombie sideline breathed oxygen, then put it on the carriers and sent it for further investigation.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Tennessee State WSMV said that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center has been completed.
Harris added that there was no information on the type and extent of the trauma, and Tennessee State was trying to determine when it occurred.
The official sporting season running back Abercrombie is a transfer from Illinois and is playing his first season with Tennessee State.
He recovered five balls before leaving the game on Saturday, and his total of recoveries during the season was 18.
Foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher landmark tax
Under the new tariffs, foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher landmark tax and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The highest marginal tax will be levied on UK tax-free persons
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise up to £120 million a year and allocate it to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers buying UK real estate will be taxed at a higher rate of interest and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless.
Promoting affordable housing and targeting high-income people, the move is expected to reduce the risk of a successful Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
The significant increase in taxation will be levied on UK taxpayers and businesses, and the additional money will be used to support the Government's campaign against homelessness.
The additional charge  is paid next to the current landmark tax, including higher rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second home or rental of a house  can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are owned by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it harder for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outdoors, making many of the richest countries, especially the capital, ghost towns.
The new strategy was introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a significant tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by quickly buying land but not using it, and urged May to address the shame of UK housing by rejecting home-buying quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching housing reforms, including a rental price control and a ban on unblemished evictions.
He also wants more power to build new homes to give the councils.
May said: "Last year I said that as Prime Minister I would seek to restore the British dream that every new generation must have a better life.
And that means we need to fix our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not correct that non-UK residents and companies established abroad can buy a home as easily as hardworking UK residents.
For many, the dream of home has become almost impossible, and the threat of the demise of homelessness is still too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish election.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's national team manager.
The 42-year-old Scottish man likes the challenge of reviving the North-East, currently third in the Premier League and three points behind the top-seeded club.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I came to the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
But as a child, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my father watching a lot of Scottish football matches, and it always drew me back.
I'm sure this opportunity will only happen if I manage the club successfully.
Ross was preceded by Sunderland, led by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, the former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not nervous about taking on the role of such prominent managers at such a big club.
Now my success will be judged by the answer to the question, can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
The club is definitely part of the Premier League, he said, by structure and terms.
It's not an easy task to bring him back, but maybe it's only after I get the club back in the league that I think I've been successful here.
Ross's managerial career lasts only three years, before he worked as assistant manager at Dumberton and took over as manager of Heart for 15 months.
He later helped the relegated Alloa to the third division, and the club St Mirren, which was threatened with relegation, became champions the following season.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he has ever felt in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
This change was probably radical, as he recalls the leadership of God.
I thought it was better to lead than to play.
It sounds strange, because I was followed, earned a lot of money, and enjoyed satisfactory results.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to overcome a lot of problems every week.
And it's not easy right now, the stress and the stress of work, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and I do now, because growing up, I always felt like I was in my own corner, but leading is the most rewarding thing.
You can hear the whole interview on Sportssound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland from 12.00 to 13.00 English Summer Time
The study found that the best time to drink beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of the UK's poorest slumbers, but it further exacerbated the burden on the restaurant networks.
The figures revealed that in July, sales of bars and pubs increased by 2.7 percent, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who produced the data, said: "The endless sunshine and longer-than-expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that the trend continued in July, similar to that of June, when the restaurant revenue rose 2.8 percent.
In June, retail sales in restaurants fell 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation worsened.
The main income from the sale of drinks was undoubtedly the best in the pubs and bars, and sales increased more than the decline in restaurants.
While not as severe as restaurant companies, the main income from the food trade was also affected by the sunburn.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages in well-organized taverns and bars increased by 6.6% this month and sales of food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of the leisure and leisure sector analysis firm RSM says that these results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
In the case of food establishments, the main factors continue to be the weather and the impact of key social and sporting events.
The fact that the 4.8% drop in sales in one year will be particularly painful will contribute to the unabated pressure on costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for most food business revenues, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures in August will provide the necessary respite.
The overall sales growth in stalls and restaurants, including newly opened locations, in July was 2,7%, reflecting a slowdown in the development of branded networks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracking tool for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector and recognised by its guidelines, collects and analyses operational data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children has hidden social media accounts from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, has social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that there is an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news increased fears that sexual content was being advertised
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a primary account
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- create a secret social media account and hide it from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that there is a rapid increase in fake Instagram pages, a reference to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The news increased fears that sexual content was being advertised
Twenty percent of the students said they used a censored main account to show their parents, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that the teenager was insisting: "Rape me".
Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent Schools (CoS) survey found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two accounts, with half of these students recognising that they are concealing accounts.
MDG chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council.
At the Annual General Meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Sports Council, Eilidha Doyle was elected as its Director Consultant.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish lightweight and president, and Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for sporting leaders to draw on the range of international experience they have gained over the past decade.
'Eilidha has gained a lot of respect from the sporting community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we have no doubt that her membership of the Scottish Sports Council will be of great benefit,' said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I really want to be a voice for athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic gold medals in total, now appears as a regular BBC expert, after a brief bout of diarrhea, was unable to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke last month.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would be only a matter of time before I recovered and to what extent.
I had to work to get out, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I do exercise!
Thank you for your encouraging message!
Breastfeeding ads online that compare mothers to cows received mixed reviews
The breastfeeding company received mixed reviews for its advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the product, described as the world's first silent wearable breast lift, consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic music video-inspired ad to demonstrate the freedom that a new baby-sitting mother can enjoy.
In a full-on shirt, four real moms dance to a sound recording that you hear, like, "Yeah, I'm lying to myself, but I don't see any tail". And if you haven't noticed, this isn't a kiss, this is my belly.
The annex continues: "Cut it out, pull it out, feed the babies with it, pull it out, pull it out, pray for my beauties".
However, the advertisement on the company's Facebook page raised an online controversy.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it was a sneak peek at the horrors of the dairy industry.
For this product, advertising using cows is a very bad solution.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only to give birth to their newborn babies after being taken away from them for a few days, wrote one woman.
Breast pain is not noticeable in the feeding tube (Elvie / Mother)
Another commented: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use their unused advertising to give breast implants to mothers who do not take babies?
Someone added: "Advertising is a complete misunderstanding".
Another commentator defended the ad. One woman admitted that the song seemed very funny to her.
I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy it if I still had food.
I felt like a cow when I was breastfeeding.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This product is brilliant, she wrote.
Another commented: "This fun ad is for mothers who are losing their milk (often in workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to be drunk or to condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they are all dancing with their unseen hips attached to their lipsticks.
The campaign's idea is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie painting does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes and is not visible in the feeding tube, so that women can move freely, hold babies or even leave the house when they are breastfeeding.
Mother's partner and creative director, Ana Balarin, commented: "Elvie's pentauk is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative start to the trade.
Comparing breeding women to dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the breastfeeding and all the challenges it brings, while also showing the amazing sense of freedom that the new breed will bring, as much as possible, with pleasure.
This isn't the first time that a painting of Elvis has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski demonstrated her collection on the podium with this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border in a month has remained relatively unchanged, but the number of migrant children detained has increased significantly  partly because the Trump administration's strict rhetoric and policies have made it harder for them to be accommodated with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared that applying for child custody would risk their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was further increased when the federal government announced in June that prospective caregivers and other adult family members would be required to submit fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week, immigration and customs chief Matthew Albence testified to Congress that the agency had detained several dozen people who applied for adult unborn child care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
Nearly 80% of these persons  carers or their family members  live in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we're going to continue to persecute these people, Albence said.
According to the shelter, authorities have introduced new rules to speed up the examination of children's cases, which require some children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than within 60 days as was the norm.
Many will try to defend their application for legal status against an immigration judge by using a video conference call rather than coming in person.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported soon.
According to shelter staff and recent reports from the system, the longer children are held, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent break-ins or attempted escape.
Advocates say that this is even more worrying in large institutions such as the Tornillo Shelter, where the size increases the likelihood that you will not notice signs of a child's vomiting.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many have already experienced.
Syria has ordered the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In addition, in a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, argued that the foreign forces involved in the fight against terrorism on Syrian soil were illegal and would be treated accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said.
Moualem claimed that the war on terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus will not stop fighting this holy battle until we have eliminated all terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all areas of Syria.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were good, while accusing some Western countries of spreading unfounded fears that deter refugees from returning.
"We have reached out to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return", he said.
They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid once Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and the war is over.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created the conditions for speedy political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale Russian-backed Syrian offensive against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for clear terms and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front affiliated with al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the Committee of Government and Opposition members to prepare a draft constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government's participation in the committee would limit the work of the  group to the revision of the current constitutional articles and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be re-elected to a second term?
According to this logic, Trump would have been elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers would have expected, his presidency was over with a scandal and a scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!
There's no sign of the viewers' fatigue yet.
Since 2014, CNN's best-ever broadcast time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's  has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"It's a fire that draws people because we don't understand", says Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Descent" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the congressional bombing.
Nell Scovell, an accomplished comedy writer and author of "Just Fun Parts and Some Unfortunate Truths About Secret Entry to the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
She said, "He's making me laugh", Scovell said.
Chaos is worth the trouble of being wasted.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the stories coming out of Washington could determine Roe v. Wade's future, the possibility of bringing immigrant families together, and the state of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it takes more than just being a citizen to be informed, when you're sober to watch a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward uses unpublished data in his book, "The Baywatch", Paul Manafort demonstrates a $15,000-worth oyster leather jacket and what the shocking description of Storm Daniel Trump's anatomy means.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"His actions are like reality shows, because every night he's throwing you something about the changing characters of the Trump Show and the daily storylines of the NFL or the glory of Kim Jong-un", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars.

When I contacted Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Cape Town, and the sun was shining, but he was drowning inside and, recording CNN, watching MSNBC.
He couldn't escape, not when Bret Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on his hands.
I remember when we were doing this crazy show, people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss said.
I thought this was some kind of joke, but they were right.

The fight for the House of Representatives is being fought in the middle of a tense term with money pouring in from the surrounding areas.
No wonder the congressional district reorganization that resulted in two House members trying to win the same seat in Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district was a waste of money.
The recently moved suburban Pittsburgh ward has drawn Democratic House member Conor Lamb to the race, which he won in a special election last spring in a different district.
Lamb is running against Republican Rep. Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, which is largely overtaken by the new 17th.
Maps were turned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old county was forged in violation of the constitution for the benefit of the Republicans.
During the campaign, the main party financial institutions in the new 17th district, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKKC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK), clashed over campaign finance.
Lamb gained notoriety in Pennsylvania when a small minority of the 18th Congressional District won a wide-scale special election in March.
For more than a decade, Republicans have held the seat, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The politicians gave the Democrats this advantage.
The US considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, but then relaxed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but they did not receive a substantial negative response from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country until the partners overthrew the Trump Organization leadership.
In response to recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, officials at the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, in a statement released earlier this month.
But sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions for individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting last year, which was considered a major step forward in preventing immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
"In an effort to show the importance of this meeting by the administration, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers for the conference scheduled for mid-October", the diplomats said.
And three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any announcement of any Washington sanctions or sanctions.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the discussion, which was shared by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations only if their anonymity is preserved.
Their accounts are confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, provided his anonymity is maintained.
Learn from History
The report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice is inevitably expected to follow.
In addition, Mueller is reportedly investigating whether Trump's campaign was conducted in secret in cooperation with Russia, which has damaged our election.
If Congress were to go to another hand, Trump would have to take responsibility for this institution at the same time as he prepares to run again before the electorate, and perhaps finally the board of directors.
There's a lot of confusion here, and I'm not going to say that Trump's end is inevitable, like his European counterparts.
We're all going to have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and those choices will determine whether the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler - enough to keep the West from resisting him and supporting Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We were reassured and missed the opportunity to prevent the slaughter that would continue for years to come.
History revolves around these crucial turning points - then the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such key turning points.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as the man who's the mastermind behind Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's confusion began when the paper reported that last year an official had offered to record the president in secret and was considering his ineptitude to serve.
Rosenstein claims that the Times' story is inaccurate.
What would we do if the new FBI investigation into Bret Kavanaugh was found to be incomplete or inaccurate, or if, despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, this candidate was nominated to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, in the midterm elections, will we vote for Congress to force Trump to take over?
If we fail these tests, a long winter will be threatened for democracy.
But given the lessons I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once housed me as ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years, she sent me to light sand candles on a table with a swastika.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is looking forward to the Rapid Vienna clash.
On Thursday, the Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna knowing that if they win against the Austrians after a spectacular match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
With a road injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was only able to make his first appearance of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he hopes the Rangers can use that as a springboard to bigger goals.
"We had a good result because Villarreal are a great team", said the 31-year-old.
We started playing with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended up with this.
Maybe we could have been more peaceful in the end, but overall, the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first half, and we went to the second and figured out who we were.
Thursday is another important European league night.
I hope we can get three points, and it's going to be a tough game because they've done great in the last few games, but I have no doubt that with the support of the audience, we can move forward and get a good result.
Last year was really hard, and what happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now it's in a good mood.
The team is good and the boys are really happy; you're training great.
I hope we can move on now, forget about last season and play well.
This fear of pension savings makes women struggle with impotence
Although the respondents clearly understood the care they wanted, few talked about it with their family members.
Almost half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they had spoken to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't want to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
That's where we should start.
If you do not give your wishes in advance, your family will not be able to provide for you.
Discuss with your counselor and family about where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors can be important in determining costs.
You can also ask a financial advisor to help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
In long-term care, you can choose to cover these costs by using a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed-money life insurance certificate or by covering your property while you have money.
Select legal documents and use the documents to prevent legal disputes.
Select a health authority, and appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical needs and ensure that your wishes are respected if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the authority to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid in the event of failure.

A man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
After spending the evening in the city, a man who had returned home was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The victim, aged 40, was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand in the Oxford Grey district of Ilfracum, Devon.
The shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local time in England's summer, was described by officials as an accident.
The dog didn't see the attack.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police are asking for witness assistance.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said.
As a result of the destruction, the officials of the communications services were unable to obtain any data from the Dongla Regency  area lying north of Palau, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the city after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about the island of Sulawesi, along with the island of Palu and Dongla.
With a population of around 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, established at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency located along the coast of Sulawesi, a northwestern island, more than 300 km (180 miles) away.
The regency  in the smaller administrative region  in 2017 had a population of about 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of the central province of Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Dongla.
The province also has a large nickel mine, though mostly concentrated in Moravia, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Donga have been hit by several tsunamis over the past century.
In 1938, the Dongla tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami struck western Dongla in 1996 and killed nine people.
Seismically active in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is constantly afflicted with earthquakes.
Consider some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southernmost part of Indonesia's most populous island of Java and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck a region near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
In 2010, a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentavay Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters [10 m] high, sweeping through ten villages and killing about 300 people.
In 2016, the unbroken earthquake in Aceh destroyed the Pidija Jaa Regency and caused panic as people remembered how everything was destroyed after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but the collapsing buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist-populated island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists on the coast.
Senior Sarah Palin's son is being held on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A police report released Saturday said that Palin, 29, of Vassils, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took his phone away from her.
According to KTUU, Paulin was returned to Mat-Su Pre-trial detention center for a term of imprisonment and released on a $500 bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, on appeal, he pleaded not guilty, the network said.
The defendant is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Paul has been charged with a crime.
He was charged with the December 2017 attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the suspected assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
He was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and with the crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while not on board.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for linking her son's brutal behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the tsunami that struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Social media has been sharing videos of the tsunami.
The tsunami struck the coast as hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Paul.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that hasn't been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
On October 31, a 30-year-old Saipov from the Home Depot allegedly rented a truck and attacked a bicycle track along the West Main Street in Lower Manhattan, driving a pedestrian and bicycle.
According to a notice of intent to impose the death penalty in the southern district of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both of these charges could carry the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued a 22-point indictment for Saipov, including eight counts of murder, property abuse, and assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was well planned and planned, and Saipov described the way he carried it out as disgusting, cruel and immoral.
The intention statement states that the actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevicia Saipov have resulted in the injury, injury and loss of loved ones of the following family members and friends: Diego Enrique Angelina, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death penalty case was tried in the Southern District of New York a decade ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out was in 1953 in a federal case in New York City, where the husbands Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted two years ago of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not regret his behavior immediately after the attack or months later.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by Islamic State (ISIS) videos he watched on his phone.
Police said he also asked for the Islamic State flag to be hung in the hospital's lobby.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defender, said they were clearly disappointed in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than pleading guilty and serving life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
The Saipov defense team has earlier asked the prosecutors not to carry out the death penalty.
Tory MP says that the Brexit negotiations must be carried out by NIGELAS FARAGE'
At a Tory conference today, Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize the People's Army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the warmth of Eurosceptics and one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested he lead the EU negotiations.
Peter Bone, a Conservative member of the House of Commons, told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would have withdrawn by now had Farage been Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to unite her divided factions were revealed by EU-sponsored Tories who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty implementing her agreed compromise plan in the Czech Republic, where she is being championed by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it seek an agreement with Brussels despite hostile reactions and forced Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone's at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull said he wanted to break the Checker plan.
He argued that Farage should be an equal partner and should be entrusted with the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have left the EU already, he said.
The Welingborough MP added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Checker plan.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We fought in world wars not to humiliate others.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
'Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.'
And the Brexit supporter, Andrea Jenkins, was also at the demonstrations and told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The plan of Cherry is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among members of our party and activists who take to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Checker plan and start listening.
In a critical statement, May added: "The Prime Minister has kept his posts while keeping his promises".
Farage's said that the politicians who are in favour should be forced to feel the heat if they issue a decision taken in a referendum in 2016.
'It's a question of our confidence, of our nation and of our political class now,' he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, so today we're here to tell them not to give up on doing so.
He added, addressing the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel hot.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has brought us a Brexit victory and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom.
And Brexit opponents were marching through the streets of Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
The group was formed this weekend by a group of activists who posted posters against Brexit.
Labour leader Lord Adonis has been blaming the Conservatives for the security problems they faced over the party's programme at the start of the conference.
These are people who say they can deploy the IT systems and all the technologies needed for Canada plus plus, borderless and free trade without borders with Ireland, he said.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will seriously consider running for president.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was speaking about her future at a public meeting Saturday night in Massachusetts.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, where she will meet Republican State Representative Geoff Dahl, one of the leaders of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There was speculation that she might run into Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon's event in Holyooke was her 36th public meeting with voters.
One participant asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and set up a collapsed government, and that women should lead it.
Suspect arrested in the LSU Sims shooting case
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they arrested a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11:00 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man seen in it.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the South Campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that Wayde's Sims was shot in the head and died from his injuries.
Wade was defending his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, to having a gun and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-inch, pre-season student, grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them in the starting five, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points per game and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title when the team orders him to award the victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott beat Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions for the race would be crucial.
Starting the race from the first place, Bott got off to a great start and, defending his position in the first two rounds, almost got into Hamilton's hands, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into the two-hole garage, left Hamilton, and he was back in the race in the group stages, so it was fateful.
The Mercedes crashed into a two-hole garage behind the wheel and returned to the track behind the Vettel, but Hamilton pulled forward after a few unfinished actions after a double maneuver by the Ferrari driver, unwittingly releasing the inside of the track in an attempt to maintain position in the third leg.
Celebrating his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the end of the race, but by the end of the first lap, he was already on the seventh.
He was the fastest part of most races, as he drove without turning the tyres to get to the finish as fast as possible, overtook Kimi Raikkonen and finished fourth.
Finally, on lap 44, he ran into a two-hole garage, but on the remaining eight laps he failed to accelerate and Raikkonen crossed the finish line for a quarter.
Walter had a rough day, because he had a great weekend, and when I was asked to spend it, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the first two places, Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump slammed Senator Dianne Feinstein for denying the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, which accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, in a meeting with the public on Saturday.
In his speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly list Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he said what was happening in the Senate showed that people were unwilling, unfit and wrong.
"What could have happened and is actually happening in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, unwanted, unfit and unjust", he said.
When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, "Oh, I didn't do that".
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Do you remember her answer to the question of whether the document was leaked?
- No, I really don't.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we were going... no, we weren't, he added, posing as a senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee, "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations and I did not deny her story".
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.
But the president didn't seem to agree with her denial, and he said in a meeting with people on Saturday night, "You know, it was really bad body language.
She may not have been, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In further defending a Supreme Court justice candidate accused of illegal sexual behavior by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the charges to their advantage.
They are determined to restore power by any means necessary.
You see the naivety, the indecency; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to go through to gain power and control", the president quoted the media as saying.
The Dundee Stars 5:3 and the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer in a game against the Dandy Giants, two shots.
The Dundee Stars recovered from their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday and won the Sunday match against Dundee in a 5-3 draw.
The Giants were on the move early, with two wins coming in a year for Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were tied before Dwyer led the Giants back to the front.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team tied the score, but two later goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered their third defeat of the season in the Premier League, before coming on Friday night in Belfast to defeat Dundee 2-1.
This was the fourth meeting of the team this season, the previous three games being won by the Giants.
Dwyer hit the first pitch in the fourth minute (3.35) of the Kendall McFaullard pass, and four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the pass after David Rutherford's pass.
In a tough start, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game with a 13:10 lead, and after Matt Marquard's transfer, Cownie tied the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got to the first half to take the lead, and at the end of the first half, he won his second night's pitch.
With the quantitative advantage, the owners of the field regrouped and Bouchard again tied the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen's first-ever Dandy team advance to the second round of the playoffs, cementing the win by scoring a fifth-place finish in the middle of the last round.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
A flight attendant died to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
An Indonesian flight director is hailed as a hero after helping a plane carrying several hundred passengers safely into the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing since the tsunami that devastated Sulawesi on Friday.
The area was further ravaged by repeated earthquakes and many people were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly volatile control tower at the airport in the city of Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri in Pal.
He remained at his job to help the flight 6321 of the Batak Air aircraft, which was already on the boarding tracks at the time, take off safely.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower was falling, he jumped out.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We have endlessly hurtful news", he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster relief agency reports that the cities of Dangalos, Sigi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many are still under the rubble and cannot be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
A six-meter-high wave swept through the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "High-speed cars bring in casualties every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Self-service shops are being robbed everywhere .
Janis Gelfand, head of the International Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is urgently helping the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Paulo on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "Please all of you work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok devastated Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Airline News reports that one person has been missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon.
The airline, which operated the flight that ended in a plane crash in the Pacific bay of Micronesia, now says one person is missing, although it previously said all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the crashed plane.
In a statement, Air New Guinea said it had no knowledge of a single man on board Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in search of the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local boat helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuc Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said the six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the accident and what exactly the sequence of events was.
The Airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon, not reaching its landing path.
Some witnesses believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had fallen from a very low ground.
"It was very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others had managed to get up to the emergency exits on a plane that was flooded and overrun by the sun.
He said the flight crew panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a non-life-threatening head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that after repairing a nearby pier, its sailors also helped rescue people who were being carried ashore by boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none were owned by Air Niugini.
The analyst set out the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office has provided the facts of a repeat case on Saturday of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a court expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to link the entire movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessicos Chambers on the night of his death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chamber the night of her death, contrary to previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford made his statement and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tell was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was drunk because his truck was in Nashville.
Another misconception was that Tell claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records show they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tell deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and address information from his phone.
He wiped her out of his life, Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
Hip Hop trio wants to change the negative attitude towards the genre by spreading positive messages through their music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop is moving away from the roots of political messages and focusing on social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and popularize conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently reborn artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black one?
A New York-based nanny sued the couple after they were fired for a racist message.
A New York schoolteacher sued the couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a message sent to a wrong address from a mother complaining that she was still a single black woman.
The couple denies being racist and called the lawsuit rape.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
I'm sorry, but I'm glad Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a note to his husband.
But she sent it twice to Mr. Maurice, not to her husband.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable about her unwillingness and fired Maurice, saying that her former nurse, an African-American, had done her job poorly and hoped to get a Filipino instead.
Mr. Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice has sued the couple for damages for the dismissal and is seeking to plead for even $350 a day for a half-year of living and working at the home of a client she was originally hired to, without a contract.
I want to show them that they can't do that kind of thing, she said on Friday, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.
The couple denied the accusations of racism and said that it was wise to fire Maurice because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after he insulted her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, "my husband, Joel Plasc, said to the Post.
Would you trust your children with someone you were not good at, even though that was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so.
Plath, who likened the case to rape, said his wife had just had a baby two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to judge this?
This is not very nice behavior, added the investment banking expert.
While the case was being heard, the media began to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the bear speaking
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to feel anywhere else reading a book for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know what we know about Padington's enormous success.
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he found inspiration to write a children's book about the teddy bear, would not have been too disappointed if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release years after his death was both pleasant and sad.
Speaking of Padington, whom she describes as a very important member of the family, she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
He was a rather calm man and did not like to be drunk, she said.
Because Padington was so much like himself, he felt like he had a child who had accomplished something: you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your job.
I think he's got a similar view of Padington's success story.
Although it was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always earned his own money for Padington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nicos Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nad has been calling constantly saying that she is in very bad shape, not expected to survive", said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Ned, who called to say that she had two minutes to live and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to support her heartbeat slowly stopped working and left the body.
She died a little early, and that was the end of it.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I could not fight, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself.
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning his dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the difficult test she was facing.
No one knew, she said.
My head was lowered and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a lot of pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The purpose of the women's card is to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are distributing inspirational text messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge for people to call and ask for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any single parent to feel the way I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lyndon, said that her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lights up the room.
But he quit the job before he died, because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother who had committed suicide.
Mr. Davis said, "I've been worried for years that there might be a chain reaction".
Mr. Davis created these cards so people would know that there are people around them to talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit still, you have to talk.
Mr. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who retired shortly after his mother's death.
She didn't say she felt depressed, depressed, and not complaining, she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed his attitude.
At Christmas, the situation was very bad: when children were giving away their gifts, he did not look them in the eye or respond.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to overcome it: leaving an emptiness in the family.
It's breaking our hearts.
But we all have to live on and fight.

When the FBI opened an investigation, the future of Bret Kavanaugh was in doubt.
I thought that if we could actually get something he asked for, a limited duration and scope of investigation, we might bring some unity, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was meeting in a strong-willed faction.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their objection is determined only by time.
The November 6 midterm elections are just five weeks away, and if the Republicans do poorly as expected, their efforts to elect the right person to the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush called the Senators to try to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's former private secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate his relationship and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
With Kim's rise to power, the number of North Korean deserters has declined.
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea had declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said that last year there were 1 127 deserters, compared with 2 706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the main factors were tightened border controls between North Korea and China and rising human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back home.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were centered on the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when both sides agreed in principle to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions since then.
If there is no trust in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally arm the former in any way, Ri said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi finds Brett Kavanaugh a criminal and claims he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Mr Pelosi made these comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune on Saturday in Austin, Texas.
I just can't help but think that if a woman behaved like that, she would be called hysterical.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh spoke about family and high school, and he was very emotional, sometimes screaming or shouting.
He also strongly condemned former Democrats on the committee, calling him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational wreck" not orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it exposed his bias toward Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the Clinton and Democratic Party's assault", she said.
Asked whether he would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy were approved and the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
"I'll say this. If he's lying to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court but in the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Mr. Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Ms Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Mr Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or in the case of Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to be judged by saying, 'How wonderful!' " said Pelosi.
The Power Women Should Have
It's a legitimate criticism of the last months and even years of anger she has accumulated, which she cannot express without tears.
When we're angry, we cry, as Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman, a manager of a company, who said that she cries when she's angry, but she developed a method: when she's angry and she starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm actually pissed off.
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are considered acceptable expressions of anger, in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of one of my first jobs, where most of the men worked, and I once started crying out of unspeakable anger, and then I was grabbed by an older woman, a fierce supervisor, who was always a little bit scared, and she pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying", he told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you.
Democratic congresswoman from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught on board the ship Monkey Business (a phrase meaning "free time") and withdrew from the race, Mr Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
It wasn't a well-thought-out decision, they laughed at me after 30 years.
 There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snowball with Seven Knives".
And when she got to the campaign, there was little time to raise the money, so she vowed not to run until she had $2 million.
It was an unequal battle.
She noticed that some sponsors, after giving men $1,000, only gave her $250.
Did they think I was getting a discount? She wondered.
In her speech announcing her launch of a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotion of people who were grateful, the frustration of the system that made it very difficult to raise funds and reach directly the voters rather than the representatives, and the anger about sexism, she said.
You'd think I was nervous, remembering the press reaction to her speech.
You'd think I was backed by the Kleenex waitress business.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my grave marker?
Was she crying?
What the US-China Trade Era Can Do for Beijing
The first battles of the US-China trade war were fought, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the long-term battle may be beneficial to Beijing.
The US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year after imposing a tax on the main Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant opposition came this week when new tariffs came into effect affecting goods worth up to US$200 billion (£150 billion), meaning that half of Chinese exports to the US will be taxed.
Beijing responded to all measures with the same latest decision to impose a tariff of five to 10 percent on US goods worth a total of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the US tooth for tooth, and it seems that this second-largest global market is definitely not going to go down anytime soon.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China complied, but publicly humiliating the United States would be too much of a fool for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its game properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run as it will reduce the interdependence between these markets.
"The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would cause an economic upheaval in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have acknowledged so far", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Asia-New America Security Center at the Institute for Science.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept returning refugees
Syria has said it is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
The progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation in the region much more stable and secure, he said.
The government continues to work to rebuild terrorist sites and restore the situation to normal.
All conditions have already been set for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that would affect their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that around 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, defeating the USA in the final by 16.5:10,5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the Le Golf National Stadium near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight European titles and has not won the Ryder Cup on this continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Björn's team scored 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time following him throughout the tournament, threw a shot from the starting field straight into the water in the 16th hole with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari has excelled in all rounds and became one of four players to achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament took its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the lowest-ranked European player, Thorbjörn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player of all time in the tournament, with 25.5 career points.
I rarely cry, but I can't control myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we've got the glass back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help, as the emotionally charged Garcia spoke after the European victory.
He's handing over the relay to his cousin John Rame, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods", said 23-year-old Rahm, "and I grew up watching him play".
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 of the biggest prizes and only landing Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the ball all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated high level play throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. Army said after the disappointing team showed up, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a certain moment this morning when we started printing Europeans.
We were walking.
I'm wearing a hat on Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You've got to lower your head.
Our opponents were superior.
Red flood reports: concentrations in Paineala, Manatee and Sarasota are declining
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) states that overall red tide levels in the Tampa Bay Aquarium are declining.
According to the FWC, more fragmentary blooms were observed in Painelas, Manaci, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  which suggests that the concentration is decreasing.
The Red Flood flowering covers about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Li counties.
The floodplains can be found about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but they're less than last week.
Red flooding has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, concentrations were reported in Painelas County and its coastal areas as average, along the Hillsborough coastline from low to high, in Manachi County from low to high, in Sarasota County and the coastal areas from low to high, in Charlotte County from low to medium, along the coastline from low to high, and in Collier County from low to low.
There are still reports of airway disturbances in Painelas, Manaci, Sarasota, Li and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of airway disturbances in northwest Florida in the past week.
