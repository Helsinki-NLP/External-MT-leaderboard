Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two sides agreed to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also discuss the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution being discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lacking will in the peace process.
The deal Obama promoted for the Iranian nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected in reference to the then-upcoming elections in Israel.
In an emergency call, the professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a slightly trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers needed to come to his house.
Lamb was important to point out that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note scrawled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university personnel heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, another death had occurred: Lamb had taken his own life when the police locked him up.
A day after the university shooting that forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as the testimony of students and staff who knew him, helped paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a faculty of 17 and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviours.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the PhD for which Lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic path to an assistant professorship.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination".
Those are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the escape from the campus, police later tracked Lamb down as he reentered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up around here.
Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and pedagogy.
He got his PhD in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her how to play guitar for a few years.
He was the lady's crush back then.
All the girls melted away when he was there", said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously dating for a while.
In the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was no marriage certificate.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that borders a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19.
"She was totally devastated", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played a few gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a small audience.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were cleaning up and joking.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, was the first-semester seminar program director, specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas, where he was president of his fraternity and student council.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight memorial service Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
That story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the 911 call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamb did call Prentiss his wife in his 911 call, there is no indication that the two were ever married.
Toys R Us plans to cut staff for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the Christmas season as it did last year, but the toy and baby product retailer says it will give its current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and another 45,000 will be hired by Christmas 2014.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
With the holidays themselves months away, Christmas shopping is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who will sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and I'm starting to realize that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me", he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it occurs to me that I'm a simulated yawning and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really", Spielberg said, "undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterates his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent council members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers 'make this situation insoluble'.
The European Union welcomes the efforts made by the five permanent members to resolve the crisis in Syria in the same way as they did in the nuclear deal with Iran.
Eight polls showing Donald Trump is a serious man.
Some have tried to brand it a flop.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting to crash.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously question what it means for the real estate mogul's chances of being nominated.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
No one is saying that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election.
But outlier groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's tenacity and are starting to pour their dollars into toppling him.
Here are some recent survey results that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's approval ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "upset" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in the line of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, were the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post reported Monday.
The same number is true in the nation's first primary state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he lacks the personality to effectively run his office, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the Republican nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That's a change from when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: Republican voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus only 28 percent for the eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a large number of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely contributing to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September showed that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump garners the majority support.
He's 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 ahead of Walker, 19 ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur by 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they've formed their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they cast their ballots firmly.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say that they will never change their mind.
Forty-six percent said they would leave the door open to move on to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competitor at the moment is another outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've formed their own opinion are twice as likely to support Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "rapists", immigration has been a focal point of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic language will drive out key Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will, apparently.
Frustration with the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience in a new ABC/Post poll Monday.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "displeased" and 21 percent "hell-bent".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea.
On the street, the average square foot of a thatched roof house costs 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited", the study says - hence the high price.
A new study shows the specific locations where a square foot costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student lodge in Munich is not really a small amount.
Unlike Germany's top places to live, the price seems like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing locations - with prices per square metre at dizzying heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros per square meter, remember.
But if you can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of the list.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A lucky shot by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to earn a deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it happened.
A glorious start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Pyrenees.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League against the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90. +2) and Götze's goal (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start in the series is expected to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally try to take the Henkelpot to Munich in the third attempt.
Müller received a kindly assist from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who let a shot of the world champion pass, thought to be a flank.
"We will not underestimate them", Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed performance without glittering.
Piräus had won his last six home games in the top flight, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bavaria, undefeated in seven European Cup matches against Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They responded courageously, but often with too little imagination in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a change of play on the left-back Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Braunschweig defender Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flank hit from the right midfield in the left upper goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave up the possible 2:0.
The best chances in the first half were Robert Lewandowski's.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the Polish's headball off the line (26).
Then by direct, the goalkeeper Roberto paired with his knee (35).
Although the Bavarians were playing their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put a pinch.
But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was reliable.
Like when he fired a shot of Ideye over the barrel (56).
Recently, Guardiola had a four-way tie with David Alaba in the centre, defending alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, was sitting outside at first.
The champion only gave the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something else out of it, that is already evil".
Guardiola also opted against him in the first substitution when he brought Kingsley Coman in for the injured Lewandowski (59).
Götze was late for Arturo Vidal (76) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, per eleven metres Müller put another on it.
Before the game, there was a fight in the stadium.
After a small group of partly masked Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piráeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was taken out of the stadium injured.
Smoking increases the risk of tooth loss
Smoking harms not only the lungs but also the teeth, suggests a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news is, if you don't, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the conclusion of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared with nonsmokers, smokers had a 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher risk of premature tooth loss.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and gum inflammation, the DIfE points out.
Smoking is a risk factor for this disease, the authors stress.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to higher rates of gum disease in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
But people who quit smoking may reduce their risk in a short time, say researchers in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than a decade for the risk to fall back to the level of nonsmokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham, England.
"Smoking shortens life expectancy", said DIfE study leader Heiner Boeing, who said that people need to be convinced to quit smoking.
Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by tooth loss, reports DIfE.
Previous studies have suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne on several occasions.
Near the site of the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called landmarks.
The museum is always involved in all construction projects in the Cologne city district as the specialist office for the care of archaeological monuments.
In the third phase of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists have now made a discovery.
The city of Trier said that textual documents had already shown that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with some 350 graves, which probably belonged to the church, was also discovered.
Young woman caught on freight train
After a young woman was injured at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police are asking the public for help.
Early Wednesday morning, at about 1:40 a.m., the woman came from the direction of the station building, crossed the tracks at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
The Federal Police say that she suffered serious injuries from the train.
She was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital by emergency services.
The investigating officers have no information as to the reason for the young woman's nighttime crossing.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents may have heard acoustic signals.
The question is asked by residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbackerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be obtained from the Federal Police's free 24-hour hotline at 0800/6888000 or from any other police service.
The European Commission proposes a new court in the TTIP dispute
To defuse the dispute over the proposed transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The aim is to replace the controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states with a more transparent system that is much more similar in its functioning to traditional courts.
'We want to create a system that citizens trust,' said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the launch.
Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration system specifically provide for EU and US states to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the US and third countries in equal parts.
The Commission has also proposed a second instance for the first time.
It would allow appeals against judgments.
The parties to the proceedings have so far agreed on arbitrators, whose judgments could not be appealed.
The debate over the past few months has shown that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström said.
In the long term, she says, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) procedures, which are particularly demanded by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the strong opposition to TTIP in Europe.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system through which companies can fight for damages at the expense of taxpayers, override national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial comments, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
The main criticism was that they were not intended to apply to the free trade agreement with Canada (CETA) already negotiated.
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, discussed with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the business's rights to sue by introducing too many new rules.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The EU's newly-formed European Parliament has been asked to vote on the draft resolution.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA.
The agreement was originally to be finalised by the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer applicable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne (now Luxor).
Next to it is a flip chart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens' talk.
He uses various places he repeatedly records on the map to tell us what his meticulously and delicately arranged songs tell us.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
The third album, Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, was released in 2003 and features cleverly composed songs that harmoniously blend very closely with late 1960s American folk, but can drift into the great opulence at any time.
Rumor has it that "Michigan" is the first in a daring series of songs that will be sung in succession in each of the 50 states.
But as early as 2004 and in the Rhine region, "Seven Swans" has already been released and is breaking positive expectations.
Reduced, Stevens is performing here.
Live, he plays guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
In 2005, a widely acclaimed masterpiece, "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") was published.
Brimming with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album entered the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses a very extensive amount of electronic spare parts on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Long after the small clubs had been established, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decor.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark hamburger
Theatre, he presents mainly "Carrie & Lowell", available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now confined to their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play through the widely enriched album.
The audience says that the lecture is "more opulent" and that you can "basically throw away the record".
Stevens humbly thanks for an addition, plays a few older songs, and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and fight David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be closely watched by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less drama and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and has been the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he had recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's senior leadership team, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "stacking up" within Labour after Mr Corbyn's comments on the EU position and the limit on gains.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow minister for work and pensions, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron across the dispatch box in Parliament since he became Tory leader in the last decade.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has crowd-sourced ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said the Prime Minister's Question Time was too confrontational and that he would avoid both "flashy" and back-and-forth arguments and instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will represent him when he is not attending - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues might occasionally speak and that he had approached John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theatre" often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shots fired in Joburg': Homeless youths trained to be photographers

The pound rises as a result of accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose sharply on data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, profit before bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
This was the fastest rate since 2009 and the most reliable estimate of when interest rates would be raised.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed by 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the dominant stock in the market, having jumped by 20% after a takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% on encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures are above expectations and also showed that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, are again growing.
Glencore shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers in the index, falling 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs set its rating for the company to sell.
JD Sports increased by 3.1%, after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are a threat to expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more buying power in the pockets of potential customers".
But he says it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, the star of the show.
A 21-year-old young man with a fancy frisbee.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair weighs 100 million euros.
More than that.
At the moment, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
It's like the Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's not bad.
Hundreds of fans were with Justin yesterday.
Among them are Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
But since 7 a.m., the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the luxury hotel in Berlin's Potsdamer Platz.
This is where your idol lives, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite that the Canadian singer lives in costs the same as her mother Ewa earns in six months.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria should be in the tenth grade in high school".
"I'm making her dream come true".
School?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
The Super Bowl commercials, he made $3 million, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company, and a lot of money went into Bieber's account.
And every doll that looks like him and walks over the counter, Bieber collects, too.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee, you're amazed at the window.
He's said to have stolen over 100 million dollars.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Even Bieber, whose fourth album is due in November, is not interested in the many zeroes.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to the idea of potato doner
Potatoes or donuts?
Both are possible in the potato doughnuts invented by Hani Alhay, a restaurant owner in Oldenburg.
Inspired by the slogan "Potatoes instead of donuts" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
He got the idea from a poster at a Pegida demonstration that said "Potatoes instead of donuts", which he had seen on TV.
Since then, his shop has been running a barbecue place filled with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculture for the stomach", says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered the idea with the Munich patent office.
The Authority has recently declared that it is protected as a utility model.
Alhay therefore does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes are in the spit.
He says, "It tastes even better together".
The culinary understanding of the peoples is also well received by his customers.
Metcash launches groundbreaking campaign to combat Aldi-invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA branches from an Aldi expansion in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a groundbreaking campaign to defend IGA retailers' market share in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo handing out samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler holds its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA store business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after opening its first markets, Aldi will grab about five percent of the food market in these two states, cutting off sales to all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in annual revenue and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in South Africa and 30 in Western Australia next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the volumes on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's food and beverage business revenue will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash will probably be gone within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is believed that a member of the Metcash board contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery business, which serves some 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back and is investing more than $150 million to match retail prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to help IGA retailers improve their stores by providing faster growing fresh foods and a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's CEO Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store renovation programs will add to Elan's bottom line and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior, according to Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, often referred to as "Special Ks", came into the limelight after Kyrgios' infamous fight with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit the kid".
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a cramp prevented a potential U.S. Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite excited about is the fact that I think Thanasi got a little bit drawn into the argument", Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well at the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so forth, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to exclude Kyrgios from the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man to return to the team as a long-term fixture".
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has really quickly made the climb that people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's rising in the public eye, and he's made some bad mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight where he can just think about it, I think is appropriate, and it's best for the team, and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the goal of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
People fleeing violence were stranded for an unknown amount of time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints in the countries and set up tents and settled there.
But frustrations were mounting.
As a police helicopter hovered overhead, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian emergency police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" for migrants from Hungary to be sent back while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism and to the fight against terrorism.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or by the end of the year - for EU countries to take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on any immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to build the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many refugees from war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which took effect at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the 4-meter (13 ft) high fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia, and also impose higher prison sentences on convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still needs to approve the deployment of the military, which is expected to begin next week, but Associated Press reporters have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, while 15 others had already entered the country further in.
They come in by damaging the fence, they're now in police custody and are being charged with committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are working to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and crowded in to crowd in.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary and said they would be denied food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race nationwide, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary (58 percent before), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is receiving the support of 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say what their opinion is on which candidate they're going to support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their vote than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton has a big lead in women and moderates, but those leads have been declining.
Her support among the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is trailing by just five points.
Clinton's lead in Democratic voters under 50 has vanished, and she and Sanders are now on a par.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was leading Sanders by double digits in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially fond of her.
Views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their top candidate, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the new rules.
As the vice president weighs a potential presidential candidate, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want him in the race - even though a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who their party's second choice would be, Biden is in the lead.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden's second-round pick would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second in this measure, but the percentage who consider him the "most eligible" has risen.
Yet when asked what's more important to a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about electability.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out to these primary voters as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well in some key traits among voters in their party's primary elections.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the best of the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these polls, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be raised about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem was revealed.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinions of her had worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views on Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the electorate does not consider her an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also view Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush perform best on honesty.
A majority of people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is up close to Donald Trump in the national poll.
Ben Carson is in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, trailing closely behind Donald Trump.
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are losing ground dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, rising from 23 percent in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 percent in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot from 6 percent to 23 percent over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well-received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with college degrees.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is down with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker falling the lowest, from 10 percent support last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 percent and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls, landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump at 32%.
The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising up last week, Trump found some sidestepping for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Comfortable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [29°C].
Even if peaks are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for a swimmer to find warm water.
A swim in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather brief pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people are no longer going to sea: The water in the North and Baltic Seas is up to 18 degrees this week, the German weather service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures of up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [29°C] in the east.
In the Adriatic it's 25 degrees at the top, in France it's 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is coming up to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual at a fraternity in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to walk across a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members started hiding utensils and basically put the good of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng", said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly bruised in the head, torso and thighs with blunt force.
"Too many families have been torn apart by the brotherhood's harassment, and at least one student has died from harassment every year since 1970", said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and forming a criminal organization.
"We want to hold not only the people involved responsible, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will hold them accountable", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership in the local group.
That's what's gonna happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
A rise in interest rates will come, and the boom will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will all last and how long it will last.
In particular, history for economics provides little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have been so emphatic that investors should not focus on when it starts raising interest rates, but rather on the time needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, in the end, market participants might find that the whole excitement about an interest rate increase may have been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a client message.
In contrast, we do not expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal levels, but still to be too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
But that does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look at how some sectors of the economy might respond, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the impact is not as dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset returns to choke 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps again reflecting the slowdown in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed raises rates.
More specifically, the market has been on an uptrend for most of the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the path to higher interest rates, pretty flat in the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis released by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on equities tend to occur later in the upside cycle and yields begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that didn't exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is very remarkable that GDP will be near its lowest point if the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950 have only twice put nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue, and the Atlanta Fed estimates that the third quarter will be only 1.5 percent.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "is it different this time", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading only gives a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, all the upward cycles from 1950 to the present have been in a supercycle of increasing GDP momentum, eclipsing pre-recession highs very quickly after the recovery began", the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession, with a record 35 months, and 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the cycle of increases, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to converge and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better yields in such a climate, although "we are still cautious about expecting higher yields", Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says, markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded and volatility has risen - all market features as the Fed tighten its strategy.
In general, companies that do most of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with high debt will fare worse because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and so will financing their debt.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with a strong balance sheet outperformed companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP criticized the station for its "stupidity"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just imitating The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, a leading MP claims, increasing new pressure on the station to prove it is doing something the private broadcasters are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public radio station was "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'fuck' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just another name for The Brits.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you are actually just imitating what is already on the market", said Mr Bingham.
The BBC's director general rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it came to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will never learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and musicianship that's truly unmatched.
"And I also think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more work needed to be done to engage audiences than it has in the past because Britons are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production to come under fire during the Culture, Media and Sport Selection Committee hearing for trampling on its commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - be produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he hopes the company will "find a hit from our own barn" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future or spending fee-paying money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month was the lowest since records began in 2000 .
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November has slowed spending
For over a decade, online shopping has been booming, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have become ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five per cent increase on the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, it has always evolved over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when shoppers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do it in different environments, like at home on the couch.
But now that's shifting in, and we may see growth slow down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that shoppers hold back on their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of shoppers who went to their computers to make bargains was five times higher, and some retailers' websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers were fighting over bargains, could discourage shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of every £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury crane victims in Mecca - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group in part
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed on Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the streets to pay their respects as the first of the dead began their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the Holy Place, where just days earlier a construction crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed sanctions on the bin Laden family's construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 Bedouins killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram was with his parents at the Grand Mosque before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already vowed to continue the Hajj to Mecca with thousands continuing to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the crane's arm standing when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathering for Hajj later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for not keeping up with security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of a massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is undertaking major construction projects.
The late leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was dispossessed by his family in the 1990s.
The crane crash came amid heavy winds and rain, just days before millions of people were due to arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required of every healthy Muslim at least once in his life.
Officials said 158 people are still in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£174,000) be paid to the families of the dead and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Other injured will get half of that.
B&Q boss says the days of cheap Eastern European craftsmen are over
British workers increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix shops targeting artisans.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide.
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British are laying down their hammers and brushes in favour of using skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work in their homes
If you are skilled with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because Brits are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the chain of construction shops, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices was now outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops targeting artisans and to close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the majority of the staff are men.
She said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends, which have seen more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men in our branches.
We must move this more towards balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions about purchasing items made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women to head a UK FTSE100 company, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior management positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of its team made up of women, including its CEO and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: 'This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly profit and sales after the group shouldered the costs of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob in court for disloyalty
The Austrian Volleyball Association (AIA) has announced that it will be closing its doors on 1 January.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been accused of abuse of office.
He was acquitted of the charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to the Prosecutor General Robert Riffel, it had been revealed in the preliminary investigation that the defendants used funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial misconduct.
The President of the Supreme Court, Judge Michaela Sanin, dismissed this fact.
It's to be negotiated at a later date.
The defence argued that the association had never suffered a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials had only charged for compensation and had relieved the sports club, for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, of its debts, which amounted to some 600 000 schilling (about EUR 44,000) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Should we continue to run the club or close it down?" said one of the defendants, a chief inspector of the tax office.
He and his colleague and co-defendant then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have put money in advance, we have put our life insurance in the bank as collateral", he said at the time of the agreement.
The association had agreed that they could manage the money freely, but that no debts should be incurred.
The Commission also decided to pay the costs back to 1991 if the scheme was successful financially.
Therefore, part of the compensation for the costs was not paid until years later, i.e. from 2003, when a surplus was added to the account.
The former head of the company explained that the company was also charged for a lump sum and not for a detailed charge.
The accounts and savings books were managed jointly by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed in detail to the association.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial situation, the only thing that was important was the freedom from debt, the reply said.
When an official was investigated for abuse of office in 2011, a sum of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association's account.
The defendants stated that these were reserves.
This securities account was in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he thought it was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about the money, the prosecutor said.
The official explained that the co-accused had been informed.
This transfer was formulated as 'compensation'.
Why compensation? The judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant explained that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "That's all you're gonna get out of this".
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
The official also said that he never received a cent of his salary, only mileage and allowances.
He added that he charged the club 1,000 euros a month for dietary allowances, but the actual cost was much higher.
The accused could not produce accurate records of their early years.
They explained that these had been discontinued after an inspection in which everything was assessed as correct.
The second defendant also received a mileage.
He said that all the payments had been made in cash and that he had to travel from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg.
The main hearing will resume on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting another 30,000 jobs.
In addition to the personnel reductions that have been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will cut more jobs when it splits the company.
The job losses at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are endless.
The US technology group plans to cut 25,000-30,000 jobs in its corporate customer business as part of its restructuring.
The company said on Tuesday that this would save $2.7 billion in costs.
The move will result in a special charge of about $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been going on for three years, is not yet complete.
HP still employed around 302,000 people at the end of the financial year 2013/14.
After the stock market, Hewlett-Packard's stock dropped 2.3 percent.
The Palo Alto, California, printer-based conglomerate is currently splitting up, with the aim of consolidating the computer and printer business into a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The second largest PC manufacturer in the world, after Lenovo, was recently hit by a further disappointment in PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services.
In the third quarter ending in July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 per cent.
Sales fell 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This led to a decline in revenues in 15 of the 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has been slow to respond as customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and increasingly shop online.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee a total reduction of some 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: Majority support for training mission against IS
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
61 percent say it's good that other countries are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
Twenty-four percent are against intervening in the conflict.
51 percent of respondents reject cooperation with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while 20 percent would be in favor.
29 percent were undecided.
Car: second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the fair, which runs until 27 September, will be on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday, with the theme "Mobility connects".
The IAA will be open to the public from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors, as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannon against several hundred angry refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind them, a police line had formed, and behind the policemen, a water cannon was ready.
Forty to fifty refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers began by using pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
The group was disbanded.
The refugees have now retreated a little while.
A pregnant woman, apparently injured, was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees collapsed and were short of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police were also injured by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of interest rate decision for the US central bank
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision of whether to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half of those who thought the Fed would do so last week now think the Fed will stick around a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero zone and start a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is performing relatively well, trillions of dollars are being added to the balance sheet and generating only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.
It has warned markets to prepare for an increase, but the signs suggest that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 8pm ET on Thursday.
Shooter at Delta State University left a note apologizing
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" about the first murder and wanted to "undo it", authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social studies at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m.
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency worker that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night", and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house, but that he "won't bother anyone", but he'll probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before finally taking his own life Monday night as police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also having an affair with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangular relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years, as a "good person".
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter who's 19, and she's "down to earth".
He said that Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he's not going to jail".
When officers caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, ran on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also reportedly struggles with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this must be taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is transforming the group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year by improving its organisation alone.
150 of the world's 1,000 or so executives will lose their jobs.
But there are new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and is upgrading the low-cost subsidiary of Eurowings.
The aim of the restructuring is to generate a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and profit synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the management team around CEO Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
The restructuring underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the group intends to use to compete with Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
The organisation of the 120 000-employee company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which generates three quarters of its annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
The strike was called off by the Cockpit (VC) pilots' association, which is due to resume negotiations on Thursday.
The union said so.
The subject of the talks is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible "within a year of a forecast record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
The background, apart from the temporary supply of pilots, is the "Wings" savings concept.
It provides that Lufthansa will outsource routes to Eurowings' low-cost airline in order to compete with competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can 't play for months with a double fracture .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-sided midfielder cry and will keep him out of action for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital".
He's being transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible, a kid who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time, and then plays fantastically, and then this happens.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and he's not gonna play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11-yard field goal and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my journey to recovery begins now, I'm coming back stronger".
In this regard, Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the PSV defeat.
The England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury".
When a player leaves the field with this kind of injury, everybody's very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played Van Gaal's Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it's a very bad injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
It was impossible for me to see the moment.
All I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like he touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel really bad about this.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's something that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it won't take long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on the company's website, adding: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I love to read to my kids because there always seems to be an image or message we've missed".
All fine and well, except that the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a content of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand on the fairly brief original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneedville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", reads the article.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads in part like the Lorax movie summary presented on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins: "In the walled town of Thneedville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is being ravaged by the money-hungry, tree-cutting, thneed-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the namesake Lorax, a squatting, mustachioed creature "speaking for the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low-level PR assignment was delegated to an assistant who didn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but did not provide any further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with expulsion from the England team, but it's still hard
To face Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but if you look at the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an outdoor victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the team spirit is strong; they won't bear the scars of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing into a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even though he is an unknown size at Test level, is an option for the attack.
In related news, Adam Lyth has been dropped from the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because -- and I said this earlier -- players are their own best selectors.
A long time ago, Lyth would have been allowed to run, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he makes more runs for Yorkshire, he'll get another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn't perform so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team man above all.
The question of how much time a test batter is given to make his mark is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven chances, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play home and away.
The only charge that can be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean when Lyth was in top form, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hitter that I respect.
He's an X-Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge ground, which hit us very hard.
He must at least get the same opportunities as the ones before him, but this will depend, of course, on the team's lineup in the UAE.
The idea of having Moeen bat alongside Cook, which would give an extra spin bowler and get four quick ones, came up, and I'm okay with it.
I don't see why a batsman can't hit there, and this left-hander has already shown he's a devil's boy of cricket.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's number three to them, and it doesn't make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before he started as an opener in 2001.
He made 300 runs at once and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes on as a backup spinner, and in my limited time with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People might look at his stats -- average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a punt, but there's not a lot of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England have made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Tests could be a master coup.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, who's gonna bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all odds.
Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball stage of the Tour, bringing energy and a powerful setup.
I always felt he was made for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air, even if the news is consistent with what was said before.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I for one have no problem with that.
Some of you may disagree, but coaches and team builders don't set the timetable.
And you have to remember that like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp could gain traction if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's unfinished renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to get more and more difficult every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to lead the Labour or TUC, which was in a fierce dispute over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is, and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-created agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly don't want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also did not like them if they endangered social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, and then come home and say they're winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Let's not be alone with France", says Berlin - is showing that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany's cautiously-minded Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it looks bad for her, as happened to the overly long-standing ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking to be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
It's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to imagine that they would rip off a leg to help the selfie-taking Britons, whose energy should be better spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So it's possible that some of these ministers may even be planning deliberately unhelpful remarks, all SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign, to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation".
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and how skeptical of the EU the oligarchy of the press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 which supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
You may have a faint memory of Boris Johnson, the arch-Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself as an EU-level-banana Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing crooks, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-natives who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about it, but found that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you're better off handing out bananas to distract them than becoming their lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more of a Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum whirlwind, because Blair had set the principle for the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a backdoor for him.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott of Murdoch's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - let me put it mildly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-collar tendency and the wilder realms of Tory petty-English can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week as the Boy Scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow soldiers and MPs after all the reports at their final meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn is trying to convey -- remember, it even touched me -- news discipline remains important in the age of 24-hour TV and above all in the whirlwind of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right that Cameron should not be given a free pass for Europe which would allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins would think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to make sense of everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - in making concessions to the British when all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of when I launched on Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
A government-funded agency's claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principle report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data, pointing to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers, writing in BMJ, asked whether the claims were "based on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
Indeed, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the harms of different nicotine-containing products, and the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director had previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said he received funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was previously reported to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the panel members are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also cite industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research "significantly acknowledges" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of harm for most products on most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a way for children or non-smokers to smoke" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had been responded to before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but that we still need to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the National Health Service £2 billion a year.
By presenting clear, current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows such as Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in highly contested time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
"I have a problem with the idea of the BBC commissioning or broadcasting programmes that are also clearly shown by unsubsidised rivals", Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programmes that others do not make or commission.
They're broadcasting The Voice in a prime time window because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax would fund programs that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such programme, EastEnders is another, both of which are, admittedly, self-produced.
Honestly, other networks would give their right arm for that.
I am trying to see how this should be public television.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former Sky chief Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-private niche programmes "should go to BBC4 where you can't quite measure the audience, but they're doing their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, 'Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that nobody has seen.'
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson told the committee: "I would urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a great deal of value here, but for people who are a lot of money for 150 pounds, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that little of the BBC's production was now officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% in radio - and it should take the example of the public television stations in Australia and Canada and change this to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as proms, which he said are only shown a handful on television, and form alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells with sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction when they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that are too high in frequency for human hearing to hear.
The pulses work by turning on motor neuron cells that are genetically engineered to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound.
Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new technique called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses to the brains of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then enter the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves open these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are attached, says a report in Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified through the micro bubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The process has some similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unimpeded and can be sent to the brain from above the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads are a disgrace to Britain's arms trade
Watch the video of the Amnesty International anti-gun show.
They're the worst killer drones.
Wrist-breaking leg braces!
Cluster bombs, please!
And electric shocks that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this advert for the world's largest arms fair is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to shred arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters on bus stops and subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Will you be riding the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads the London Underground's typeface and the DLR's trademark line, which transforms into a tank image.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be riding the DLR... asking customers to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismalland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of in-box keys that are claimed to "get access to around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this "vandalism" of the billboards.
One of the spoof ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and realize that they need to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by advertising agency VCCP, a nonprofit working with the graphic designer and voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence surrounding the gunshow's advertising - through a blank space on the Excel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic shady corporate ad, but "by infusing it with bright colors and animation, it keeps sticking".
"They have done a fantastic job helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British Government and a guarantee that torture devices are not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun show comes from the area inside ExCeL, where exhibitors shred fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a US Army order for "the shoulder-fired AT4CS RS".
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding aftereffects inside the target".
Whatever it does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
Eleven years ago, I moved into a dorm as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I've annoyed -- and the many, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student dormitories can range from mildly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, if and where you took a sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room".
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It's a conversation driver, and it helps you find the people you like as opposed to the people you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes caught fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Leave the people.
People's rooms often turn into receptions, movie nights, and community gathering places, but they're also places where people get dressed and straighten their underwear.
Related to this: Don't think about starting a relationship in college.
Introverts get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dormitories form a room-to-room cuddling culture that's friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
There's nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so I can get back the energy that I spent interacting with you".
Try to sense when a classmate is tired of being around you - and text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm had this idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
Since you're starting college at the height of baking craze, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies is less weird than the 1950s greeting, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions".
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk and may eventually associate your face with a delightful surprise.
Of course, that depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a drop of milk for your tea?
Check with the milkman.
Chances are they'll say they're self-serving even when they're cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my roommate who added detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that will keep people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the word, one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind turning down the drum and bass because it's 3:00 in the morning and she has a test in the morning.
They responded with louder music.
When they finally stopped at five o'clock, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before she let her own music play, locked her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
Conversely, would it not be deeply embarrassing to think of a roommate as your future mate, to pick on her, to break up with her again, and then to see her every day and perhaps watch her move all of her mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart has its own way of doing things - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future mate, at least try to reason with your underbelly.
The exciting moment you notice that someone left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good joke is funny, but it only takes a few moments to turn into a boomerang.
Hide a valuable and entertaining lesson in safety - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock her door, put her keys in a glass of water, and put them in the freezer - but do not tap her belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
The number of people living in the area is growing rapidly.
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building townhouses in the central Frankish corner for people who don't have much money.
So for refugees, for example, but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing, but also single mothers and low-income people".
"I show how to build cheaply and well even today", the 44-year-old says in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be pouring into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to create affordable housing quickly.
Mr. Gildner, a lot of refugees are gonna be coming into the housing market.
What solution do you propose?
Markus Gildner: Mass containerised housing or gyms are unsustainable.
Because most of the people are staying here.
In view of the refugee flow, we will need adequate housing for the next decades.
A very ordinary three-story townhouse is the solution.
A row house is the least space-intensive.
It makes it easier to integrate.
It's different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted to suit their needs.
How much is it?
The price for 160 square metres of living space per house is 184,000 euros, excluding land.
It's not too hard to figure out.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
I've done my project correctly.
The threat of the sword of Damocles and the special construction and the order of the site always make things particularly complicated.
It's creepy.
It is still assumed that if you create three apartments in a row house, you need at least three places.
Only the cities lack the space for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
There were some who accused me of creating luxury housing for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you exacerbating the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true that we have had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury homes have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that even normal people need housing.
Not just refugees, but also single mothers or low-income people.
I'm going to show you how to build cheaply and well.
That's what this is about.

iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple releases an update
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software update".
When it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that says "Software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush subsides or try updating via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room, but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update, and it will also be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway through and this could cause the update to be discontinued.

Rosberg 's only motto is full attack .
Nico Rosberg knows only one slogan in the fight for the Formula 1 World Championship against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The World Champion emphasized before the start of the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separating the reigning world champion from defending champion and two-time defending champion Hamilton before Sunday's night race in Singapore.
The Briton has won seven of the previous 12 races and is also the favourite to take on the city-state's floodlight Grand Prix.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The Chess Friends Bad Kissingen, which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, bringing the number of members to 19.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a keen chess and tennis player who has been to Bad Kissingen for treatment more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann has supported the Bad Kissingen Chess Club with a donation, which was accepted by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to take in chess players who cannot raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent searching should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wants his membership in the chess club and his friendly contact with the Red-White Tennis Club to be seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Quartermaster wants direct contact .
Saludis and the Antonistift Centre for the Elderly have joined forces under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take courses there.
The social welfare foundation is pulling it down the hill into the city.
More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, next to the shopping centre, seniors and those seeking advice can now find information on matters such as nursing insurance or benefits from the sickness and nursing funds.
For years, we've been finding in our outpatient care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"Many of the services provided by the pension funds are not often used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood", explained the new housekeeper, Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antoninift and the Amadeus ambulance service.
In addition to counselling, the new district office also offers prevention, health and wellness courses.
The Saludis were taken on board.
Therefore, additional services such as fall prevention, memory training, or physical therapy may be available.
The services of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideally complementary.
Saludis is the acronym for prevention, care and rehabilitation.
"The senior care centre", said Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis.
The reason for opening the new quarter office in the city centre is the demographic change.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasised at the inauguration ceremony that the district office also deals with loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular social gathering".
The social foundation thus made a major contribution to the fact that the elderly could live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4 to 6 o'clock and Saturdays from 10 to 12 o'clock.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburg Kickers on the 6th of October
Now it's official: after renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburg Kickers had not yet been set, the date was now set for October 6.
The match between FC Eintracht Bamberg and third-tier club FC Würzburg Kickers in the round of 16 of the Bavarian Football Totopokal has now been decided.
The match will be played on Tuesday, October 6th at 7pm in the Fuchsparkstadion in Bamberg.
"We are happy that we now know when the game will be played, we now have planning certainty", said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also pointed to the now-started ticket sale.
It's a special thing for our team to play against a third-tier.
We therefore hope for a large audience, and for good reason, because floodlights have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg entered the round of 16 in 2010 by winning the district league 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Club Cup.
Defending champions are third-placed SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyenes of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as the broadcast said.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also been active as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Tim Wiese is offering money to a police officer
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been unpopular in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a wrestler.
He claims to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years.
But he did not gain any intellectual strength.
Wiese was getting his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking attendant outside issue a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the fine at her feet, reports Bild newspaper.
The city of Bremen has confirmed the allegations but is not yet clear on the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination", says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether to advertise meadow or not.

Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: on Friday evening, at about 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends about 15 feet away, police said, shouting to them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the level of the bft service station.
Three people were also present at the gas station.
One of the men shouted at the young man and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a broken nose and heavy nosebleeds.
When his two friends rushed up and appeased the bat, the man at first gave up.
His friends now brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator followed the group in a car to their apartment and demonstrated several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the bat and another male.
The victim was beaten on the face and thighs with a club.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far, we've only got a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second bat is said to have been about five feet six inches [1.65 m] tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-and-white shirt.
Police are asking witnesses and informants to call 06181/100-123.

The mayor of the municipality of Velvet, Bernd Bormann, the economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and the mayor of Asendorf, Heinfried Kabbert, are also pleased.
In many places in the countryside, doctors are lacking - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be working half a job for his successor in the coming months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, by which time he has invested EUR 310000 in the premises at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was a first-hand experience when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at Verden Hospital and also intends to enter practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would be a good fit for this practice", says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen, laughing.
"When it was time, I just called her".
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients is very attractive to us", says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and support the families over the years".
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-time father of the family Frank Müller also grew up there, his medical studies in Hanover were followed by stints in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a general practitioner in Sulingen, and was appointed chief emergency physician in the Diepholz district in 2009 and is involved as a volunteer in the DRK-Readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Starting September 19th, the new boss will be trained.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"This is why the endoscopy comes out", says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We're gonna be offering more ultrasound and long-term and stress EKGs, and we need an extra consulting room.
The computer system is also being completely upgraded.
The grant is a total of EUR 50000 from the county (25000 euros) and the municipality of Velvet (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued", stresses Velvet Municipality Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, while the average number in the north German practice is about 500.
There's another family practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's taking over the practice is that the pharmacy will remain in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If she hadn't found a successor, she would have left too.
The fact is that those who attend Müller's consultation will continue to look at familiar faces: the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff from the rock houses.
With her passing, an era in Asendorf comes to an end, after all, the doctors have been practicing there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we had only two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen remembers with a smile.
She's feeling a little sad after all this time.
"But we're still living in Hohenmoor and I'm sure we'll see a lot of patients", says the internist.
Her husband laughs and adds: "We have a 6,000-square-foot plot of land".
"I've always been afraid of gardening, but now it might be different".
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy traveling.
Croatia: 'We are letting the refugees through'
"Now border controls are being increased at our southern border", said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border will be maintained in parallel.
It was still clear that anyone who wanted to apply for asylum could do so "of course".
The provision and safety of people is paramount.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens who are eligible for EU funding.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers the corridor - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously said that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees to continue their journey towards Austria and Germany and possibly establish corridors for the refugees.
The Commission has not yet decided on the application of the new rules.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which have not yet adopted the Schengen acquis.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of asylum seekers in the EU.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work", emphasised Györkös Znidar.
The Croatian government said the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia in the early hours of Tuesday at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing to avoid registration.
Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, ever since.
The main victims are Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
The emergency services and the Red Cross are also already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects to receive around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously taken migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported concurrently on Wednesday.
However, the Belgrade government denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to do this", it said.
According to media reports, at least one bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses are expected to arrive later in the day.
Germany via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria
The prisoners had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 300 miles [500 km] away.
"We heard Hungary was closing, so the police told us to come here", said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the shift of the Balkan route between Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, which has been predicted by observers, to a somewhat more westerly route.
Croatia: 'Comprehensive possibilities for border control'
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared contingency plans in case of a large influx of refugees.
He did not give details but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had 'comprehensive border control capabilities'.
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 and has been consistently rated by EU partners as a good country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
It is not yet clear whether the remaining refugees will now wish to continue their journey to the Croatian border.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm the situation at a local eye-opener in Horgos on Wednesday morning, saying he considered the debate on alternative routes for refugees now that the Hungarian border is closed premature.
The number of refugees would not be very high at present.
It is not yet known whether they will continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to take dangerous alternative routes
However, private Hungarian aid agencies have already started distributing maps to refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger, however: parts of the border area still contain minefields that have not been cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance workers had been sent to the border region.
Hackers in Ukraine pay $30 million to the bank
Supranonok is alleged to have been part of a cybercriminal ring that has been accused of repeatedly gaining access to unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained was used to conduct insider trading on the financial markets.
In this way, investigators estimate, a total of over $100 million was raised.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders end up being caught", the SEC's announcement said.
The trials of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have operated from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenian Hospice Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
The Mannheim Paradeplatz is a busy place.
People are doing their chores, sometimes at a fast pace, sometimes comfortably strolling.
They're heading to the two stations of the Mannheim Auto Show at the parade ground.
The city's stopping trains.
A vibrant, glittering life under the glorious autumn sunshine, and in the center of it, four large signs, each with the headline, "Before I die, I want to"...
The Ecumenical Hospice has been campaigning for 20 years and has been met with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the city and into the people", says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice is available for questions and discussions with passersby, as are the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously pick up the chalk and add the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "ride the camper across the U.S"., "stop the war", or "not long to suffer", others pause, read, say phrases like "I'm not there yet", and then move on.
Every now and then, small discussions develop on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, about dealing with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on the scene.
"Only when I realize that the end of the world is coming for me will I be able to live responsibly", says the director of the Diakonische Werke Mannheim, which is a partner of the Caritas Association for Ecumenical Hospice.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the information provided by the applicant is not used to mislead the public.
The fact that not everyone wants to be publicly known on the boards is understandable, however, because it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and dying is still taboo, according to Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has done much to open people up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
She read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in assisted dying.
When the Ecumenical Hospice was called upon to provide volunteers, she immediately volunteered and was present at its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the victims and their families in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and the St. Vincent hospice.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is well equipped to handle her task and the experience and experience gained.
"I look at life from a different perspective, treating it as precious and cherishing the moment", she says.
The provision of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of denominations.
The financial support of health insurance and donations from relatives and associations makes it possible to provide training, training and supervision for the bereavement and death attendants.
Training courses are offered every two years for new employees.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the Evangelical Church House (M1, 1a) and the Catholic Church House (F2, 6).
There, too, you can write down other personal wishes on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook lower for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than previously forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 in a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases of 4.9 per cent on average, which take effect on 4 January, and higher surcharges for heavy and large parcel land transport, which will be imposed from November.
The company said that it nevertheless expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and the growth in online sales.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "making solid returns when considering weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the year before.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share forecast by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has led to stagnating sales in its express unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the bottom line at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transportation revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with an 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide if it's time to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the ornate two-story meeting room, a mural of the United States loomed overhead.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests before all else.
The Federal Reserve has a two-fold mandate from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that's too narrow to predict, as it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start weaning itself off the unprecedented stimulus from near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials fear that they will increase this volatility by raising the federal bond rate - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the main thing they're going to be looking at is the labour market and inflation", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is justification enough to keep waiting", she said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is making the financial market uncertain.
About half of the economists Bloomberg recently polled predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with one key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of a hike.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, unless strategists soften the blow by promising that another hike is a long way off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4 percent to 16,599.85.
The move was prompted by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates at this point", he said.
If it does, "it would have to go to great lengths in its statement to reassure financial markets not to panic".
Other experts argued that raising interest rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation has consistently been below the central bank's annual target of 2%, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can and needs higher interest rates because of the strain on the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were shaking at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16 percent below its peak in May as investors feared a slowdown in China's economy would dampen global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below its May high.
For Fed officials, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If it weren't for the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the reins at this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts she'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed became the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere remark by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "tighten" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not tied to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited discernible effects on growth in the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The recent turbulence doesn't come close to this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into a situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the double mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think it should be ahead of its time.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a bewildering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and tableware, furniture, religious ornaments and Christmas decorations.
There's even a car department if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the hallways.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there's a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and cheap) in this store is located near the cash registers and has several takeaway options.
What's in here: do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filet the fish and even fry it for you if you wish.
A good portion of the store is the massive freezer section, which features frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods, and more.
Who shops here: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You'll find fresh Monthong Durian here, by the register.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well-attended, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: A small life-saving aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
The warm welcome they receive is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who are selflessly supporting asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with her whole heart and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still loves to teach.
Every Thursday, she does it at the asylum-seeker's home on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German.
Of course, this is a very different class than a real school.
Brazil's Rio Grande Paediatric Society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by showing pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk contains a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet can adversely affect a child's immune system.
Exemptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction of the sports hall, which will cost 2.3 million euros.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be made flatter for solar panels.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium at the Bernrieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: the draft proposal was unanimously approved at the recent municipal council meeting without much discussion.
The Commission has already decided on a request for a construction exemption from the existing development plan.
The 'exception' concerned the authorisation of a special shape in the roof design.
The aim is to build a "saddle roof with a non-central front and roof top".
The plan is based on the planned use of the roof area for solar panels: "This will give us a wonderful large southern roof", Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof slope, which for energy reasons - contrary to the design plan - should be below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall will be significantly reduced.
An exemption was necessary because the development plan does not allow for "exceptions" in the roof slope - whereas the Bernrieder Municipal Council is usually rather restrictive in its approach to exemption applications.
However, the construction of gymnasiums is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent", says Steigenberger.
The construction of the gymnasium at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
The estimated cost is around EUR 2.3 million.
Grants are expected from the school and general sports promotion.
The next step is to submit the application for the 18 x 36 metre hall to the regional council office for examination.
The Peißenberg Hospital is moving to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director of the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff are moving from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plan of the hospital GmbH of the district, which was confirmed by the regional councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
The decision on this matter will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans are implemented, all the nearly 50 staff at the hospital in Peißenberg will be retained.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot come to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, Jochner-Weiß said.
The employees were informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the dismissal of Dr Andreas Eder, who has been Medical Director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
The question of who should take over came up, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer", who agreed to take over the helm on 1 October and move to Schongau with his team.
For the company in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrade" and an expansion of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is a specialist in gastroenterology in the Inner Ward.
Fischer and his team will run both hospitals on an interim basis for the next two years, if the board of directors approves, until next year the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed permanently in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
The county had previously planned to do so in 2018, when the ongoing rehabilitation of Weilheim Hospital is completed.
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft law on the protection of the environment and the environment.
"I'm not sure". As for the real estate, Jochner-Weiß couldn't say there were several considerations.
It currently houses a Caritas short-term care centre and a day psychiatric ward.
"We have had a wonderful experience, and we will not have another opportunity like this", says Fischer of the move to Lech, which was received by the staff "positively and with great understanding".
He said there was no real prospect for the house where Fischer has worked as chief physician for more than 30 years.
He was asked by his colleagues in Schongau to take over the post of medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades, with departments being closed, for example the surgery and the obstetrics department.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are called tonight (20.15 hours) at the Bergische HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga table is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Badener took a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for.
Hunting accident with two injured near Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the opening of a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg county), several hunters were on duty, police said.
After a gun battle, a 63-year-old man and a 22-year-old man were seriously injured and taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was unclear at first.
The Crime Lab is investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, victim of violent crime
A suspect has led police to the body of the 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who went missing on Saturday.
During interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old girl from the Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has been the victim of a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen with Kaiserslautern, as the prosecutor's office and police announced on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man who was arrested on Tuesday evening and who confessed to the crime and led investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as scheduled the night before after attending an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, investigators first came across personal items of the victim.
Interviews with friends and acquaintances of the missing men finally revealed a suspect in the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested man admitted to killing the 16-year-old and throwing her body into the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to appear before the magistrate on Wednesday, and investigators are charging him with manslaughter.
The investigation will provide further information on the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing shortage
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable housing.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The social housing sector is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pouring into a market that is already overcrowded in many big cities.
They're competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison, 260,000 units will be produced in Germany this year.
That leaves 140,000 apartments.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live in a first-aid shelter as asylum seekers.
Many then find themselves in the housing market and line up in the long lines at the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers were living in rented accommodation last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also shows significant gaps in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year by year.
The study's author, Matthias Günther, laments that some 770,000 housing units are already missing in urban areas.
Many workers in large cities were therefore forced to live in work rooms.
Young adults have been staying at the Hotel Mama involuntarily for longer because of the slump in the housing market.
In the large cities, the number of square metres per head fell again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance for Social Housing proposes a fresh start.
The aim is to stimulate new incentives for social housing.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the new rules are implemented.
The Alliance also believes that attractive tax write-offs are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation by the KfW State Bank is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had already been withdrawn by Monday evening, at EUR 184 million.
Now the project could even be scaled up.
Refugees free to move: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
Hungary is virtually impossible to cross, as more and more refugees choose the route through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the transit of goods through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
It's a dangerous route, though.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian interior minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor", said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik, Croatian television station RTL reports.
Hungary had closed its border to refugees the day before.
The new laws, which came into force on the same day, also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees through.
The Croatian Prime Minister, Zoran Milanovic, said: 'You can pass through and we are preparing for that possibility.'
These people are there, they're women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
But there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia and neighbouring Croatia.
Most of the victims were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to cross the green border into Croatia on foot.
The refugees do not encounter border fences at the Croatian-Serbian border.
The border strip, however, poses other dangers: it still contains mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
I want mine clearance to move quickly to secure passage.
The Hungarian authorities have not yet been able to provide any information on the number of refugees arriving in Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before closing time on Monday, it was still 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws criminalize crossing and damaging the border fence.
In the southern border city of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were opened.
The convicts face up to five years in prison and deportation.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were received at the newly established "transit zones" at the border on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - at the main Röszke crossing.
The applicants included 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
By Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees were reportedly there.
But in practice, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
Hungary considers Serbia to be a 'safe third country'.
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered outside the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started to clean it up.
They collected the trash that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barricades were dismantled and one of the reception centres at the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
Austria has closed its border with Serbia and Hungary, so few refugees are reaching it.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
The government estimates that some 20,000 migrants remained in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting to continue their journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped this morning on the orders of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases were standing at the entrance to the tent", said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they were going to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had suddenly stopped rail service with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, Wernstein was the end for them", says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people, along with two other helpers and their cars, across the border to nearby Passau.
Before we went, we had a little treat for the unexpected guests, with refreshments and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"It was a matter of course for us", Stadler said in the OON interview.
You were very grateful.
One man was eager to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased", says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had boarded a regional train to Passau from an ICE station in Wels on Sunday evening to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail service to Germany had been suspended.
The regional train was stopped at the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border traffic is generally high.
The bridge festival was held in social gatherings with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, and the day before a two-bridge race was held in sport - organised by the Union of Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us another thousand is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping immediately to establish structures in Röszke to guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has publicly and officially pushed the attitude of the Hungarian Government into the fog of National Socialism.
The people of Austria are not the only ones who are suffering from this policy, as they are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees too will have to find that the "promised land" that invited and welcomed them is just another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to create in our country decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the formerly powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at Traiskirchen Primary Care has already gotten Konrad under control.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen", he reported of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also carried out without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, described a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 apartments this year.
To meet this figure, 35,000 more housing units will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 by the Länder, 15,000 by the Federal Government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without a bottom", said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the heads of state.
The latter had promised him that they would also provide quarters for the refugees who came.
"It's going well in Upper Austria", said Ferry Maier.
The former vice-president-designate is supporting Konrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to discuss how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also has high expectations for the ORF's 'Helping like us' campaign.
The platform allows individuals to easily offer accommodation.
And they're hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be necessary for lodgers to have a certain height of towel racks or size of overalls.
Emergency standards should be in place for a limited period.
He has more experience in accommodation than the Ministry of the Interior.
I'm an elderly gentleman who doesn't get told a lie in the face.
He said that persuasion was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier are not causing the Republic any cost, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their staff to three or four.
The search for his own quarters has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up an office in a container on Stephansplatz.
But there are obviously problems with the permit.
Linz calls for better allocation
For the time being, the city of Linz does not plan to open municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States that are eligible for the scheme.
However, additional sites are to be tested for suitability in case of emergency.
The mayor criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution.
Seehofer: 'Border will not be sealed off'
In a lengthy telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the State President Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday on the further course of action on the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
But we have the appropriate border controls.
Special trains carrying refugees to Germany will not be running for the time being.
However, the asylum seekers would be taken to Germany by regular trains.
The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that the EU's citizens are protected and protected.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing border controls is "a logical consequence" of the German approach, Pühringer said.
The next Runtastic is only a matter of time.
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linzer Industrielinie is officially completed.
The S&T IT group has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, while the remaining 2,700 square metres will be leased to young, innovative technology companies.
"In IT, smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us", says S&T Head Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in start-up companies in the New Yard and later acquiring some.
From the outset, S&T has been keen to cooperate with its new neighbours - a promise Niederhauser makes: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
EUR 1.7 million was invested by S&T in the site, EUR 3.3 million by the Techcenter, which is one third owned by the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
Thirty percent of the remaining 2,700 square feet of space in the building is already leased, and another 40 percent is in demand.
Lia-Peroni owner opens second store in the arcade
The new store focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit was trying to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade had to put this project on hold: she has now grown into another business.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the Furla brand, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories can cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks before.
"But I've been thinking a lot about opening a store", says Breit.
The decision was made mainly because Furla producers based in Bologna were also interested in the idea of having their own shop, where only their handbags would be sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand", says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her interest in fashion was instilled in her by her mother.
I'm best served when something's developing and I can show you new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women are delighted at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the specialist cannot answer with any certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag enhances any outfit.
The Roarmaker from Cold City
Donald Trump's Palatine ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called the Proud.
This quality is also associated with the billionaire who wants to be president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for a stir.
Whether it's xenophobic remarks, harsh treatment of journalists, or revealing gaps in international crisis policy, the candidate for the U.S. presidency is stirring up the campaign.
And do it well.
This is also recorded in the Palatine town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is a familiar term to many in the wine country on the wine road.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants village is over -twenty corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Koldtstadt in the Palatinate, Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel from Kallstad made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it exciting, but they are not so impressed by their Kallstadter way", says Simone Wendel.
The Kallstadt native has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous descendants, including the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also makes a statement in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't make it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family's accomplishments, there is also a tendency to view Trump as "a bit of a big mouth", says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname Kallstadt has around town is "The Roarmakers" - in High German: the showers, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the boastful.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his late grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digging shop in the United States.
The real estate company was founded on the first land acquisitions in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not without tragedy: Their desire to return permanently to their homeland failed at the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate then belonged.
He had not received Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared at the film's launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes stark statements of the heir.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly of Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The way he's babbling is not so nice", says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was a born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American as more distant, "he's always so exuberant".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that", says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Cold Town".
Like many in Kallstad, pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that", says the 68-year-old.
She would prefer that he not win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those in charge in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have got there".
"There are more interesting topics than him", says winemaker Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president", she says.
And, "The grapes will ripen even without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, was seen by 12,000 people, and interest is also growing in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
The 1800 inhabitants of the village in Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday from the hand of the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain villages".
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of the lead on the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to cover the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it hasn't produced a major shift in Today's ratings.
The Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the nation's capital when Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today's ratings were up slightly from Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but its numbers were still below Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap to Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers on 314,000 of Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change are blowing more strongly on these morning people than on Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking.

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive audience of 1.219 million.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit solo show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's The X-Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, slightly beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5:00-5:30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers, and the second half hour drew a whopping 720,000.
Hot seat average 620,000.
The drop in the second night's ratings of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute that failed to make it past the McGuires show.

The last three agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
A secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been shrouded in secrecy.
And none of the three girls left will surely reveal if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons fellows the day before three turns two, you may have accidentally given us a hint as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips sealed till the finals on Thursday.
All three women lyrically talked about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?" Their answers could become the game-wrecker who won the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name both - except for themselves - Mackay as Wood's best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is down to earth, and it's so much fun to be with her", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
From her perspective, Mackay said that the house call last week made her realize that Wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I am now fully attuned to him", she said.
And when asked who Wood should vote for if not her, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say that", she said.
I love the girls that are left equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent in requests after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a smart move.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a brawl like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to make a punt return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colors in the locker room after the game.
Instead of beating his rookies to a pulp in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sportswriter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patting a punt recovered by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble, cursing, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was one thing that happens, you only care about the next game, and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the sculptor to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass from his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
But overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airfield.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized, and his democratic efforts blocked.
The Free Voters are demanding the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW fall term in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools if there are not new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse", Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system".
The Free Voters' parliamentary group will meet in the Lower Franconia commune until Friday.
In fact, the main themes were quite different.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voters' Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the exam", Aiwanger said.
Mr Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"We can't go on like this, we have to get to the root of it", said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free Voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that handle asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges", Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticised the inconsistency of several federal states: "We need uniform standards for the federal states nationwide".
"Bavaria is pushing away, others are not".
"We need to be more proactive".
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not be under the table.
A longstanding issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister for Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the "middle-school plus" pilot in 47 high schools, testing an extension of the secondary school from three to four years - which will then take another nine years to finish high school.
But Aiwanger is not going far enough.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated", said the FW chief.
We're asking for free choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride at the G9 anywhere you want.
Stronger Wall Street is helping Dax get off the ground.
The German stock market closed with profits after a long period of directionless and nervous trading.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start in the US stock markets provide a clear direction, which ultimately lifted the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax of medium values gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The tech-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 index, the leading index of the euro area, rose by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
Solid gains were also recorded in the trading places in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow Jones index recently rose by about 1 percent.
Many stock traders expect the markets to hold until after the US interest rate decision and the big crash in the futures markets on Friday.
The debate on the burden of nuclear decommissioning has meanwhile pushed RWE shares to record lows and also left deep traces on Eon.
According to "Spiegel", German energy companies may be short of 30 billion euros in reserves.
The Federal Government denied the figures reported in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy groups then recovered somewhat, but eventually lost 3.31% (RWE) and 6.15% (Eon).
Infineon shares rose another 3.22% at the top of the Dax.
According to one trader, a positive report from the American investment magazine Barron's this weekend had a knock-on effect.
Accordingly, investors have not paid enough attention to the German chipmaker at present.
The Commission has therefore concluded that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
The demand for cars was high: even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, the industry association Acea reported at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The shares of the carmakers Daimler and BMW rose by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent, respectively.

The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
Four killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting a proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief officer, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
He said 20 policemen and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high fatality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharu ethnic group, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since the 10th.
The country's first democratically elected president was assassinated on August 8, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Planned area of construction in the city
The plot of land near the Emmer Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter area.
A mix of trade, industry and housing is planned - but no concrete proposals have yet been made.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to sell a plot of land of about 4000 square metres in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
The preparations are under way.
The site is planned to be used for a mix of commercial, commercial and residential uses.
They're waiting for the city to make a deal.
It is not yet clear which investor is eligible.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the plot of land at the corner of Ringstraße and Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
Plans for a holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
Some investors are still worried about the sale of their holiday home
For months, behind closed doors, negotiations, musings, debates and drawing had been held.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emmer company System-Bau, presented its plans for the first time to the public on Monday evening at the Emmer Council's Urban Development Committee.
This item was originally on the non-public agenda.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP group, which accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the System Building Management went on the offensive: "We still don't have all the answers", he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to counter all the rumors now.
The project, which will cost between 10 and 12 million euros, has been discussed for months.
The images and new details of the proposed hotel project sparked a fierce reaction among the owners of the beaches who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seabed and board member of the developers' association Pro Hieve, complains: "It's going to be a giant block that will be above all other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that the planned size of the plant will cause a huge increase in traffic: "Busloads of buses will have to come in to make up for it", Schulz says.
What exactly is happening on the two-acre site of the former inn remains to be seen.
There's no operator yet.
"First we need to have a coherent concept", said Ralf Behrends.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to implement the new measures.
Twins of gorillas at the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to have a baby among its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and in 1967 it was in Frankfurt, the zoo says.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet known, as Mother Diana is still holding them tightly.
First, the "Bild" had reported.
NHC predicts a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde .
The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecast Tuesday a broad-based low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 kilometers) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands that has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical storm within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, such as the one between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weathermen added.
Google launches double-duplication campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. announced a doubling of donations to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have flooded European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the call for donations on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For diabetics who are slightly overweight, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for people with mild obesity and type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's too early to tell if people with mild obesity and diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time for mortality data to show anything", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight-loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery, or obesity surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been done on people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they collected in a study from 2007 to compare two types of obesity surgery -- gastric bypass and gastric bypass -- to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI of those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatment remained roughly the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36 percent had their diabetes completely resolved and 28 percent had partial.
In contrast, only about 1 percent of the medically treated group had complete and only about 2 percent partial resolution of diabetes.
In addition, the results on blood pressure, triglyceride, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgery' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" - as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes for the two types of surgery.
By the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg) than the gastrectomy group, had greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2.1 %) and were more likely to have completely recovered from diabetes (46.9 % vs. 16.7 %).
While the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent surgery for obesity were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared with a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for those with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study, because it says that this surgery is in this lower BMI group", without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they accumulate these genetic changes that have tied their bodies to obesity and diabetes, reversal is really hard".
A love story is set in the Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently receiving increasing attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unattractive in school, meets years later the crush of her youth, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recently published novel "We Are Not Really Like That" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hunsrück readers, because it is set in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time writer grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to put a literary monument in her hometown.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe". - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of mankind should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11, stating that the violent response of the United States led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I wrote a letter of condolence to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem was nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has had unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Quadruple increase in children's use of hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallow strong alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of hand sanitizer seizures among children under 12 years of age reported by poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more and more into these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others do so to impress their friends or because of a social media test of courage.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to produce a harder drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scents of the disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it", Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectants with the scent of strawberries, grapes, and oranges that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol", Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't leave a sip of whiskey around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and when children get them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently took four sprays of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice the legal drinking age for an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah muttered her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen from the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and store hand sanitizers out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom", reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and has banished her from her room.
The police considered the foiled plan "gossip" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: three vehicles damaged
In a hit-and-run accident at the intersection of Nordring and Auf Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a hit-and-run.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving on the intersection in the direction of a roundabout in an industrial area when he noticed too late that two vehicles in front of him had stopped in the roundabout.
Then he drove his truck into the back of an Audi and pushed it into a Ford Fiesta parked in front of him.
The accident caused damage to the vehicles worth about 10 000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old's Audi was out of commission and had to be towed.
Rumor has it there's no disharmony at Celtic.
Griffiths downplayed the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admitted the Hoops were in a bad place, but that he would turn it around.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be wary of January new commitments that could destroy the unity of the cadre.
Don's lead over Celtic is up to five points.
Adam Rooney's 11-yard field goal in the first half gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, leaving the Dons with a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths is playing down talk of disharmony .
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates were not under increased control as they prepared for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show any highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement at the Old Firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
Ronnie Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
After losing to Malmö and subsequent relegation from the Champions League, they lost to Aberdeen's 10-man squad, who now lead the table by five points.
But Deila said, "Celtic have had bad times before, and we'll come back".
Now we want to get out of there as fast as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we must move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players better.
It's so important to stick together now.
Warburton cautious about January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January signings, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new signings and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate, which you've seen with our own group this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, who has been in talks with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been battling a sore ankle for two years and missed the summer's departure from Wales.
Hearts on SFA battle suspended because of Nelson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 as Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later revoked - Collum's third red card to be revoked in eight months.
Neilson stands by his words, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance".
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The unrepentant hibee was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment", the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say I won't be returning to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow".
Tannadice board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys back on track", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "unfairly".
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side were desperate to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive league victory, giving them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half goal.
McInnes said, "There's no team that's won everything, in cup games or leagues, that hasn't won games of this sort".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12 000 over the three months, with the number now at 2 612 000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on the latest figures, David Mundell, Secretary of State for Scotland, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy".
It is almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunkards were disrupting the process
When security personnel were unable to calm the situation, the workers called the police.
Only by using pepper spray could the officers take the intruders into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed a 16-year-old boy had 0.89 per millimeter.
The teenager was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old man was 2.15 millimeters per second and initially remained in custody.
Why I'm Going to See an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will be watching a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was first sent in January by his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew nearer, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and with more applications than seats available, there's a macabre lottery to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media positions from 12 to five.
The one who is chosen will watch emotionlessly.
I can't do this. I can't.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I've developed my own relationship over the months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better", but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to cover it.
If he dies, he thinks that publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the podcast series I've been doing.
I don't want to go into all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a benefactor.
But I think there's a strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you're gonna get from me is what it's like to watch a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to leave Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale cop stayed clean when he talked the man from Canning River into it.
An attempt by a Perth man to evade police failed when he found himself in the shallow, swampy water just a few feet from a police officer who tried "to gently persuade him to return to shore".
Canning Vale Police were called to a home invasion incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he was trying to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I can't get out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape", said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins provides an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to evade a liquor check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but he inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing.
Peter Moody claims that stewards at Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in their stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming they were running a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tar sample at Lidaris, which he can't explain.
He had held back for 18 months over the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too much grapes".
"I was planning on not saying anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once", Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and I want my owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start thinking I don't, I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had set off the bomb in an interview with racing.com that Integrity had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name if asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I do inside my stables", Moody told Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should certainly grab their noses, because they failed to grab me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's gonna get personal?
Has the RVL been cowardly, perhaps blaming people outside of coaching for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and expel me, and I have no doubt what I'm saying is gonna make you think about it now.
But I've reached a point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I'm going to put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching has led him to say that he can "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horses' legs, which was a violation of the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this", he said.
"One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, which it was.
But it was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for handling the pack on race day.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but this is going too far", Moody said.
Man arrested for hit-and-run
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent hit-and-run in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver of the car continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to Shepparton Police.
He's expected to be charged with dereliction of duty and failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is taking a back seat to rivals over allegations of wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' tackling "agenda setting" by two Premier League favourites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm players to "ring fights" with his team during the Storm's high-profile victory in the Sydney qualifying final on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "model" of rugby league and saying the two Queenslanders were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tackling, saying that they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of his team by two leading coaches gives him confidence, as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or our techniques all year, but over the last six weeks, we've made our contact on tackles a real focus, and that's been the turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this keeps popping up this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our game on Friday night and how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was gonna take care of shit.
But now he has a team that can play and we find exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football -- not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I'm building a stronger confidence because they're saying these things because they're a little bit worried about playing us.
I don't think they thought of us six weeks ago when the big games were coming up.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roosters game scored higher than the Broncos vs. Cowboys game.
I mean, the Broncos game was a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the score?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or is taking breaks and not scoring points exciting?
For me, it's the game plan.
If they mention us, it means we're gonna run into them at some point.
The Storm team is off this weekend as they have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the semi-finals at AAMI Park next Saturday night.
Serbian with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to obtain 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that he could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the possibility of Maksimovic escaping.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bail as collateral to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the $200,000 bail imposed is a real financial burden", said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police daily and observe a 6:00-6:00 curfew.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: driver's house tears apart
In a hit-and-run accident involving three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had brake in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed too late and tried to avoid to the left at the last moment, but failed, police said.
The driver's cabin of the accident driver was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours until 2 a.m.
The damage was in the amount of EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, and received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in Hogg's hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it because it would "lead to pedophilia on the Internet" and then he "pretended to be a policeman to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was the one who was doing the searches on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was mentally ill when he drank and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant about them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of taking indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violating probation on January 25 of this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender registry, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing until October to get background on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was remanded in custody for hearings into other pending cases.
He was put on the sex offender registry before the date of sentencing.
Smugglers avoid small border crossings into Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up outside the large checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, fearing detection and arrest, left people at smaller border crossings
"We are not going to be able to get out of the Austrian side", said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the counties of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday along the Inn river.
They had crossed bridges and roadblocks on foot to the German side.
There they are met by federal police and taken for registration.
According to Federal Police data, more refugees arrived at Munich's main railway station on Wednesday than at the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the capital, a spokesman said this morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropical storm Henry expected in southwest
Meteorologists are warning of thunderstorms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Warm sea air is currently flowing into the country due to a low pressure area over western Europe, the German weather service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported.
The strong low was the outflow of tropical storm "Henry", which in recent days from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Severe storms and thunderstorms are expected in Baden.
According to the DWD, wind gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour are expected in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance region until Thursday morning.
The sun will be visible for a longer time on Friday.
Every two years, the carmakers show their new products at the IAA.
In 2015, the movement was mainly in compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
The car category is particularly in demand: according to the Federal Motor Vehicle Agency (KBA), around 28.1% of new registrations were in this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17-27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept cars and new high-end and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available at dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us", said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He's the core of the brand.
The new Astra is also not expected to be much more expensive to sell well.
Opel is looking to enter below its biggest competitor, VW Golf, which starts at €17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
Hesse also offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including for the first time three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike its main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially available only as a five-door.
The second variant will be the station wagon, which will be on display at the IAA in the spring.
And what else is going on with new compact cars besides the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor, the Mégane, to race.
The Mégane will be shown exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
It'll be on the market early next year, then as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The newest model in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan subsidiary wants to find its place in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits perfectly into the brand's design line.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, a diesel engine with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine with an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm) according to the manufacturer.
Sales of the Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed, is the compact DS 4 on display at the IAA.
The designers of the Citroën's luxury outboard have focused on the front: the radiator grille has been redesigned and the headlights have been fitted with LED technology.
The interior has been modernized, with the infotainment system, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and for the first time Apple's CarPlay integrated.
In addition, a number of modifications and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be introduced at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of man
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in favor of an ex-prisoner of the Tegel prison who was held for months in a cell too small.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be consulted on the draft directive.
The Federal Constitutional Court ruled in a decision published on Wednesday.
The judges said that the victims could hope for money even if they had been confined for only a few days in the too small rooms (AZ: 1 BvR 1127/14).
An ex-prisoner in Karlsruhe was successful in his constitutional complaint: he was held in a single cell with a floor area of about five square meters in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated.
After that, the man, who is now free, according to his lawyer, was moved to a larger cell.
His action against the state of Berlin for imprisonment for undignified conditions failed.
However, the constitutional judges reversed the decision of the lower court in Berlin and sent the case back for a new trial.
You see the man's dignity violated.
The Court of Appeal will now decide on the amount of compensation
It was also stated that, even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of the period in question were decisive for compensation, there was a right to compensation.
Otherwise, "there is a risk of diminishing legal protection of the personality".
The lower court must now decide the amount of the monetary compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
In April, they awarded damages to a prisoner who was locked up naked in a cell.
A 2011 ruling also found that multiple occupations of a cell without separate toilets are inhuman.
Karlsruhe also confirmed Wednesday that the Berlin Constitutional Court had granted a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane detention.
The applicant at the time was kept in a cell similar to that in Karlsruhe for between 15 and 21 hours a day for more than three months.
The Berlin prisons had also made headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
The prisoners are therefore kept locked up for 23 hours at a time, the aggressiveness is increasing, even fights have already taken place because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to lack of talent, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to take it on.
What's coming to Germany?
The German Federal Ministry of the Interior forecasts that around 800 000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year, and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) says that Germany is even able to take in a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in the face of this unusual challenge: "I say it again and again: we can do this, and we will do this".
The following is a summary of what is to come for Germany.
According to various forecasts, between 350,000 (estimates of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400,000 (estimates of the Pestel Institute) dwellings are needed annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice the number of homes built so far (250 000).
The shortage of affordable housing is particularly dramatic: 60 000 to 80 000 social housing units are being sold out of the rent-price system every year, and refugees are also applying for these particularly affordable housing units.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the amount of aid to the European Social Fund from EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
The Pestel Institute believes that this is far too little: 80 000 social housing units would have to be built annually and the Federal Government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in this.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
The Institute for Labour Market and Career Research estimates that 55 percent of refugees in Germany may be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
The integration of refugees is decisive, however, if they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from a ban on work for refugees to recognition of work.
While previously there was a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The majority view in society, also because of the shortage of skilled workers, is that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market.
A major barrier to entry into the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
The main aim of the programme is to provide a framework for the development of vocational training.
Research also shows that jobs are most often found through personal contacts.
The creation of networks is therefore, in Thränhardt's view, the key to integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a small number of refugee parents, an estimated 10 to 15 percent, put their children in the orphanages: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
To convince the family of the benefits of the day care, the administration distributes leaflets in different languages.
If the need for teachers were to increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students without German skills are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
They are not always taught by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers with only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school board.
The German Student Work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception has been Berlin, but Inn Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Refugee students who wish to study could have easier access to higher education.
Because refugees with a residence permit or a passport no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act when they start studying.
The latter are not generally granted a licence, as they do not fall within the category of persons entitled to a licence.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, but from 1 January 2016 this period was reduced to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, say Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Students' Association.
The students should be given Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
The establishment of an Islamic charity to care for the newcomers would also be important.
Rights include duties.
The representatives of Islam must therefore agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to allow it some scope for control.
This includes a willingness to take a bold stand against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to wage such conflicts in Germany "immediately renounce their right to be here in Germany", he told Bayerische Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be a society-wide issue, even more so than it is today.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States which are not in a position to take part in the European Union.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for just under a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have long been demanding and to which international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention commit Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees it has been waiting for, says chief medical officer Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can do it", he told the daily.
However, this would require additional money to be put into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery is calling for all new arrivals to be issued health cards at the same time as registration.
The benefits provided could later be billed to the Länder.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of asylum seekers in the EU to a maximum of 15 million.
Otherwise, the language barriers are what make doctors tick.
The health scientist from Berlin, Thea Borde, has already shown that migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
She said that interpreters should be paid not only in hospitals but also in doctors' offices.
But many refugees would be helped by more general medical facilities in emergency rooms.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, refugee children have significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are more likely to be educated about HIV.
The German doctors, however, were clear about the partially different symptoms from their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infestations or tuberculosis are not so hard to detect", and the refugees may even be able to provide relief for the shortage of doctors.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
However, to be admitted to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take another examination.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
The report also highlights the need for a European approach to the problem of refugees.
A recent study published by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive in Germany traumatized.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by flashbacks of breathlessness, dizziness, heart palpitations, and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, severe fear, and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although asylum seekers with mental illness can apply for psychotherapy at social services, the process usually takes several months.
In addition, social services would usually have specialists or doctors who are not trained in mental illness to decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst is drawing on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal training, and unique entertainment.
Now the circus invites Probst to dream on the brick wash.
"Our passion is the circus".
"I can't imagine living without my circus family", says Stephanie Probst, animal trainer and junior manager.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current stage show.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours", the 27-year-old junior manager emphasizes.
"A cocktail of management with a world city flair", as director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The circus's program is impressive, with talented performers from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates audiences with their wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers know their craft too.
The Cuban duo is trying to take it easy on the silent film heroes.
Lightness and mobility - these are the words they identify with.
Your humorous art on the mast is to win women's hearts in a storm.
Besides numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with their finger-pointing and articulating sensitivity.
Balancing on a ball with the unicycle?
He Yuan is fine.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin, from China, is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics and is fascinated by its mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals are part of our family", emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has also proposed a number of amendments.
Stephanie Probst agrees: "If our animals are not well, we are not well".
Some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each caress.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read every wish from their eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal is not feeling well, it will not want to go to the stable.
So the first commandment is to take good care of the animals.
Especially their Zebroid Jumbo, a hybrid of a Shetland pony and a zebra dog, is something the Probst family is proud of.
The two animals lived together in a cage for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there", says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the ride, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure", says Stephanie Probst, "whether it's five or 1,200 people, we always give our best and are wholehearted".
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m.
On Sundays, the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday's family day, so the 5:00 show is at a discount.
The zoo is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives a false speech in the parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to shout at Mr Mugabe's speech.
Last month they had attacked him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones warning them not to interrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message is from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death'", he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that their parliamentary immunity ends and that once they leave the House, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in its services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate its computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has annual sales of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing unprecedented integrated technology solutions for enterprises", the company said in a statement.
It is a division of a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment, whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift away from traditional PCs towards mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in a series of actions based on the belief that narrowly focused companies perform better.
Arsenal FC captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it's only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there's no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four England games and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had a strong finish last season after a separate ankle injury and then regained his old momentum during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a career threat", Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't related to his ankles or any of the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical standpoint, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the inherent risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return mid-season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd has documented 23 different conditions of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to have the most injury days in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that an improvement in injury rate will continue over the course of the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he will and he'll have a career the way he deserves.
Arsenal will begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is adjusting to a rotation within the squad.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little respite", Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating stadiums in Europe.
Dynamo are also undefeated after 41 games, after starting the "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the tenth in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense", Wenger said.
It never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I've been in the business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of similar depictions in shows is obvious, especially in light of how the need for men to open up has become more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men are at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of the Man, with the goal of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that when the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy moods", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends to make a friendship work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently stated, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned that focus on its head.
Each character was defined not by his work but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football in comfortable armchairs, and Ross' longing for Rachel -- all came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As one telephone-care worker explained to me . . . , "my role as a listener for people who are feeling depressed and suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference".
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying, "I can handle it", has a tremendous effect, as does the feeling that talking about problems openly is seen as weakness".
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
She's very clear about the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
So if you're going to Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned set to celebrate the day, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk?
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around Starbucks by themselves, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrating with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö.
Di Maria will make his Champions League debut on Tuesday, helping PSG to pass Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with a hugely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Prinzparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player, setting the French champions on the road, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they aim not only to qualify for the knockout rounds but to improve on their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they were getting the points, it wasn't a class game from Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missing chances in front of goal, and he was later substituted in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems for our opponents and to look back with some relaxation, even if there are certain things we still need to perfect during the season", Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score another goal or two".
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was able to keep a 2:2 draw at home to Bordeaux in the Premier League at the weekend, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was touted as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was snapped up by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he ran into the back of Malmö's defence in Marco Verratti's pass before finishing nicely past Johan Wiland in the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a big victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, entered the Anpiff with nine internationals on the field and were a tough opponent with a five-man defence and two lined up deep in midfield.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves sometimes gave up, with some misses and poor finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patched up alone in no less than five attempts in the first half and then was given up after Cavani used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shot that was passed by Wiland on the post in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally fell just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent interception by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was revoked a goal at the end.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough".
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game they played!
Glencore raises $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by plummeting commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion in a stock sale Wednesday as part of its massive debt-settlement plan.
London-based Glencore said in a statement that it had sold some £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling raw material prices as China's economic downturn squeezes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of the rights to issue the shares of Glencore rose rapidly to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of a larger plan to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new stake at 125 pence a share, which was a 2.4 percent discount from Tuesday's closing price.
It sold 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term sluggish growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people, after a mostly long flight, reached the city hall in Weimar.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The latest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official to Washington, will take place on September 25 and is a repeat of President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan for a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also providing an opportunity for President Obama and President Xi to constructively address areas of disagreement", the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and its growing confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440-hp sports cars borrowed and scrapped
A 29-year-old man wanted to fulfill a dream and rented a Ford Mustang.
Then the bad wake-up call came on the rainy highway.
A company in Gotha County can make your dream come true and one day you can rent and drive a V8 American sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
A 29-year-old man from Gotha County did the same.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, slid into a wet road and hit the control panel.
The sports car sustained total damage, no one was hurt.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40 000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented a move to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for Al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
FC Bayern was obviously close to signing Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona, a few years ago.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - Xavi's title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi reveals that he was already ready to leave Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me".
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing", he says.
And that was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria".
"Rummenigge wanted me".
The club was founded in the summer of 2008 by Jürgen Klinsmann.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't switch.
But the change did not happen.
And the man who made it all happen is now working for the German record holder, Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship".
"Pep told me I wouldn't make the switch, that he couldn't imagine the team without me".
"That's how he got me".
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi represented Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the pitch, eliminated the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king-class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon is downplaying diversity in filmmaking.
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight's Sunday Night, veteran actor Brown interrupted when Brown stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"If we're talking about diversity, you do it in the cast of the movie, not the cast of the show", Damon assured.
Brown reacted in shock, with insulted disbelief, and shouted, "Hoo! Wow. Okay", as the Martian actor's comments solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about - whoever the director is going to be - how they treat the character of Harmony", Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a whore getting beat up by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People lobbied for the film's directing rights for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing, "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WITH it hurts".
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of public debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national momentum, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the Grammy Awards' nominations for Album of the Year.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a charity", the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls to be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which had just completed its seventh season, had never seen a contestant complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finale.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time limit, making him the first athlete to complete the grueling stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge three full seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 or had a living", Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
All of a sudden... as I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he finished first overall, did not receive any prize money.
The rules say the fastest person gets the money.
"If there's more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time wins", Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's holding any grudges about it.
He's just so happy he did what he did.
He got a lot of awards from his fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I'm going to be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past the Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season wasn't exactly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, now the Tigers are last in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but they played that part perfectly Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins, 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to advance within a game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, even if it was just for one night, it was a return to the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp for much of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how they come", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck out six times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year strong", said Simon.
It's hard to pitch every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game focused.
Tiger designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in for two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since hitting four home runs against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the baton well", said Ausmus.
He looked good in [strike training], looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the back of the end zone in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a home run, and Simon struck out second baseman Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy evaded Mauer, the only man he faced, before designated rookie hitter Miguel Sano, who snapped a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run on the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in Major League history this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run in the bottom of the ninth inning, Wall hit a two-run RBI against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander knocked Sano out on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit had a game-opening advantage over Phil Hughes, who was still in the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been placed on injured reserve before the game after missing more than a month with a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted", Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt like I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning".
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who made a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez has made his 0-21 win streak with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single from the right side, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to reach third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added to their second-half lead, scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit", Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, scoring no runs in the third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez has been ruled out with a shoulder injury.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the injured list since mid-August with a sprained shoulder, is scheduled to be activated for Wednesday's launch.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade with LHP David Price on July 30.
He's been missing since August 20th due to a sprain in his right hip.
The Tigers and Twins will conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday .
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is going to play Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be housed in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for Wednesday night.
The people who arrived in the boat will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls in the Hessian capital had been prepared for this event in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily housed there.
They are to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government office responsible for the initial recording, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria a possibility.
"I believe that decisive thinking about military options cannot take place without Germany", he said.
He accused the European states of "collective vision".
Four years ago, he said, it was a good thing that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep", he told Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on Austrian television station ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's the deal", she explained.
Asked about an agreement under which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in the country.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, have called for a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
EU interior ministers will take a fresh step towards the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the large influx of refugees into Germany, the Federal Government wants to provide more support to the countries in the first reception and distribution of people.
The Federal Government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the prime ministers in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would also be given it.
But if you have no prospect of staying, you cannot stay in Germany.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stranded on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is not like Serbia, it is part of the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from trying to find escape routes through Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said of the planned new border fence.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, eyewitness reports indicate that thousands more migrants have made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on the moon of Saturn, Enceladus
Beneath the ice sheet of Saturn's moon Enceladus, there is a global ocean.
This is what researchers conclude from observations by the Cassini spacecraft.
The moon, therefore, wobbles slightly in its orbit around the ring planet.
While this wave is small, it is too large for a solid body, says a report from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A., published Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the journal Icarus.
It's been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
For example, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon in 2006, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole, astronomers concluded, there must be an underground sea.
The extent of the hidden ocean, however, was not yet understood.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
1860 Munich will have to do without offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier this week.
According to the Munich Lion, the diagnosis "probably means four weeks of forced rest".
"This is a hard loss for us, Rama.
"Of course we have to think about it now", sports director Necat Aygün told Bild newspaper, referring to the possible commitment of a non-association professional.
The sixties, however, first introduced a defensive player as a training guest.
Mr Cale, 30, was last active in Belgium and had previously been on contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
The Austrian national team player is due to start running on Thursday.
Okotie had been injured in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on the head.
Despite initial fears, he was not seriously injured.
No dietary fruit - mangoes are high in sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to keep your skinny, you're often discouraged.
Because mangoes contain relatively high amounts of sugar - especially sucrose.
Still, the exotic fruit is healthy, containing B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Mangoes, in particular, are rich in vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene.
Eating the fruit thus supports vision, the immune system, and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes, they should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The color of the peel alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very good.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste natural or sweet.
Mangoes, however, add a special touch to hearty dishes.
It eases the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads, such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango cutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
UPS is going to cut back its Christmas shopping staff to 95,000.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
We're looking for drivers, mostly.
Last year, UPS added 95,000 more workers for the holiday season.
In the face of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early preparations since last year to be ready for the Christmas shopping season.
In 2013, parcel delivery delays had attracted harsh criticism from the parcel service.
First a hailstorm, then a distinct cold front
The next night, the hail will break through the valleys of the northern Alps, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday night, the hawk sometimes blows through the hawk valleys with storm force.
After a thunderous thunderstorm on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, gusty winds and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews reports, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of a large low pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the fön breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
The wind then blows in the Föhntaller valleys until Thursday morning with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland with some gusts exceeding 100 km/h.
The hail can sometimes reach the adjacent Mediterranean, and in the mountains hurricanes can even reach speeds of over 75 miles per hour.
While stormy rains in the north on Wednesday bring summer temperatures of 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [23 to 27°C], moisture is beginning to build up on the southern slopes of the Alps.
Here, rain begins and will continue until Thursday evening.
In total, some over 100 litres per square metre of rain is expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after heavy rains in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the windmill runs out of air, followed by a cold front with heavy, sometimes torrential rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the winds are picking up strongly and the temperatures are dropping significantly.
The following days are autumn in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it is sunnier and warmer on the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of Mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on the Oppio hill was named after the German reformer on Wednesday.
On the "Piazza Martin Luther" he is now being honored as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the Working Group of Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes have often lived their faith in secret for centuries as a minority.
The square will symbolically show that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the century.
He felt that the city was a depraved sinful hell.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome, according to historians.
Luther's theses against indulgences had then opened the way for a split in the Western Church.
Hammer artist spent three years in personal Bible interpretation
Jesus with the (golded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated the Bible texts.
In the beginning was the Word?
No, not with the Ottmar Old Bible, now published with beautiful pictures.
At first, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who used 150 motifs to formulate his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
The 75-year-old has retained his "language" of colorful colors and imaginative shapes - but this is not the same as "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, it can be quite dismal when adapted to the subject.
For about three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that deal with subjects such as the Way of the Cross, the Plagues, the Commandments, or the Our Father.
This has spontaneously attracted several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has examined the Bible verses on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into the present day, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old paintings.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here expresses his very personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewelry wrapper has gold letters.
This allows the 75-year-old to double-check his soul, his emotions.
That's a high level of intimacy.
The Bible project was ultimately motivated by emotions. Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Gentleman's Order.
"There was a time when the rod was used to educate children", recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've been trying to work this out, maybe get back together with the Lord Father".
The second concern was to help art regain its prominence in a fast-paced world: "The perception of visual worlds is now shaped by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolic is being suppressed.
Artists have a different way of showing things.
Pictures are always mysterious and not decorative.
"In that respect, I'm a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall into" the images, let them affect him, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost, at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung on Tuesday, admitted that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he captures life with his pictures".
Alt did not try to cover the Bible in its entirety, but chose the topics that were important to him, even the mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration on an equal footing", says Altepost. "The pictures are the key, the text merely explains".
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen one's life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the original images - on paper and canvas - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction on BMX railway approaches
Plans were made, space was found, companies were hired, hills were modeled for a circular course: a year later, almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX track, it was over.
Failures in politics and administration caused distress, especially among the inhabitants, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So we moved hills, found new land, now with formal planning and planning permission.
The approval will come into force in October, the First Municipal Council member Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to announce in the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope that this year something visible will happen", she said.
The work on the former bathhouse was to begin without further commemoration.
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The German Football Association is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is making a clear statement this weekend.
Football is responding to the deteriorating situation in Germany and is assuring the political establishment of its help in tackling the problems ahead.
"I consider this the greatest challenge our country has faced since reunification".
"No one can say, in principle, that this is none of my business, that I have nothing to do with it".
"This must be of interest to everyone, to get this subject under control", said DFB-chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
The European Union is also committed to the development of a common defence policy.
"I'll be at the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet with Minister of State Mrs. Ozoğuz and the Chancellor".
"The theme will certainly play a central role", he announced.
Football can and will help.
The decisive directions must be taken by the political side.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019", Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Federal League players also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 trade unions will make a clear statement by wearing the slogan "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve of their jerseys instead of the usual sponsorship logo (Hermes).
"We want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can", said Leverkusen's sports chief Rudi Völler to Bild newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-evident".
"The refugee drama is everyone's business, no one can look away".
"We football league players can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly", said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig called him a "prominent sign of the league".
For the European Championships qualifier against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support for refugees as "a great joint work of German football".
He said that it was great that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their respective locations.
It's just as great that there are small and small clubs.
The message of "one for the money" that we have been sending out is being lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance", he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015", Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses eye in accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water he was carrying in his left hand after midnight, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bleeding to death, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week", says SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott can do his job.
"We will meet in Walldorf at the beginning of October before the supervisory board meeting", said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to run the software group.
"I'm all about SAP, all about my job".
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner", McDermott told the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US, but he has not been at SAP's German headquarters in Walldorf since the summer.
The manager of the "SZ" said that it was important to him to go public with such a personal story: "Anyone can happen something like this".
"The important thing is to get up when you've fallen".
McLaren 's backup driver Magnussen is out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted a photo of the injury, saying he had suffered it when he fell off his bike.
He is therefore not eligible for the Singapore night race at the weekend as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as he was a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
BVB without a giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of Marco Reus's comeback in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been dashed.
The national player will also be missing from the leader of the football league table in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 h/Sky).
"We cannot resort to him unfortunately", Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high strain on his pros, Tuchel won't just change his stump in the giant position.
He announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of goalkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level", the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League matches in the future.
He's probably gonna be in the second game, too.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final entry for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl believes understandable: "That Marco is not so wrong".
"I think we have a good chance of winning the title".
Robotic cars: government wants to pioneer for Germany
Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car, according to the will of the Federal Government.
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday adopted a strategy paper from the office of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA motor show of a "new era of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his G7 counterparts, who are also meeting with industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology.
In order to avoid the driver being subject to additional liability risks, the German government intends to review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to new developments.
For example, Germany wants to promote an international effort to raise the maximum speed allowed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The German Government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the lead, the driver becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads "are not expected until well after 2020".
The study authors estimate that the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site will be around EUR 8.4 billion in 2025.
"Digital interconnection of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport", said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-wide programmes for the protection of the environment.
Still, the Germans are skeptical of self-driving cars - much more so than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra, presented on Wednesday to the AA, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that self-driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect to have self-driving cars by 2025, while in the United States, 33 percent.
In any case, German drivers are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to surrender control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, you could imagine that at least 15 percent in traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
One in four would never let the car take control.
Boll cancels team and doubles at the table tennis world championships
The Düsseldorf man wants to play in the title games from September 25 to October 4 only in singles.
The final decision is due by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team".
"The boys found out in the morning".
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo", said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships training in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on a flight to a long-term sponsorship meeting in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"The disadvantage is that without Timo we are no longer such clear favourites", said European singles champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the seeding list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing then, and we became European champions".
"That's what we should be focusing on", said the world-ranked fifth.
England national football team player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis was a fracture of the tibia in the 20-year-old Bastian Schweinsteiger player.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a major fashion show and a wax-figure cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
Highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They're wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer who became a major star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits, among other things, and by putting men in skirts.
"I can no longer say I'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair".
"It used to be bleached, now it's real", said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on view from 18 September in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a show about himself.
He was actually against it, because "for me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death", he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes", said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits provide a glimpse into the scarcely-reviewable work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having received any formal training.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work of art, which has been put to a great deal of effort: for example, a stylist was hired specifically to do the dolls' hair.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were transported to Munich.
Just before the Oktoberfest started, there was another special treat: a leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi is meeting Madonna.
He had always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and people who were a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy bear is also on display.
It represents the designer's first, timid fashion strides.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football), he put on his teddy bra and clothes, Gaultier said.
His parents wouldn't have let him play with a doll.
He later taught himself to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at other designers' designs, as Gaultier told me in Munich.
But then I bought them later, of course.
He couldn't afford the models for his first fashion show.
They got nothing, but they could keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plain lace as a fashion niche
In the old days, it was all about the long embroidery machines and the ploughs to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers who processed them into, for example, blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer possible today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the fashion chain Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen Spitze, fashion played a greater role, then was supplanted by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: cutting edge jewelry, accessories such as bags, and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styles, is a growing order potential.
If you are not a niche player in the German textile industry, you are no longer on the market.
They're already half of our orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Stickereien together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the turnover has been lost.
Private shops and wholesale trade are almost gone.
Our products hardly reach customers this way anymore.
The bulk goods are now produced much cheaper in Asia and are distributed almost exclusively through chains.
Exports are also weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So there's plenty of reason to go in new directions.
The trade association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stick Pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce in an environmentally and socially sustainable way".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
To compete with the Asian market, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
This creates a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and companies that must think above all economically", says Schmidt.
This is why an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter brought the historic snowball top back to life.
The machine will stick small balls in some places.
The master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße from Plauen was inspired by this: "Before, I could not do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
She uses a complicated process to print the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region - young and old - identify with the issue of Plauener Spitze", says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in and around Plauen and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewelry as a modern-day ambassador for the Plauen Spit.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie.
Legends are not supposed to be touched, but Disney is still daring to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, however, this is not a remake, but a sequel set 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It's about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
Who will play Poppins 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is Rob Marshall, who recently released Into the Woods.
Xi urges opening up the economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with guiding reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies", he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Fostering new enterprises and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, supporting state-owned enterprises (SOEs), attracting private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
The statement shall be followed by a negative list identifying sectors and undertakings which are not eligible for investment.
The system is being tested and improved by means of test programmes.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the State has not yet taken any action to implement the measures.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded enterprises and provide better services to them", the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a green card by streamlining requirements and simplifying the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their rights to practise and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU to double mercury limit in fisheries
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish, giving consumers a much higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an EU working paper on the subject, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of poor industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and infants with full force", explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt said that the limit for the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as sharks and swordfish, would be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of fishermen in the EU to around 15 000.
After doubling the limit, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller fish, such as carp, are usually so low in stress that they meet the targeted limits already today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that only helps the economy", Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates heavily in the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government warns that "already small amounts, especially in unborn babies, can cause damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its website that, in view of the maximum levels in force, no "health hazard to the general population" can be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the burning of coal.
According to a written statement from the German Environment Ministry to the Green Party member of the Bundestag, Annalena Baerbock, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as the Elbe, Rhine and Danube is "permanently and widely exceeded", the "Spiegel" quoted the paper as saying in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF warning system.
