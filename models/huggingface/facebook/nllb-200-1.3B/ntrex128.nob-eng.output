Welsh MPs don't want to be seen as 'muppet'
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour representative explained his group was concerned because they rhymed on Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dusted, and pwp means b√¶sj.
A representative of the Wales-based party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "mispleased" and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said that his group was open for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word Muppet, which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for dust.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way to the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a uh sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, the members themselves have the final say in what name they are to be referred to".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the authority to change its own name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public hearing which showed general support for the renaming of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the titles of the representatives, the commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the alternative MWP received the most support during the public hearing.
The representatives are proposing other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to a head-turning for parliament president Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a legislative outline for the name change in the next couple of weeks.
The law on the reform will include other changes to how the National Assembly works, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
The representatives have the last say on what they are to be called when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether their country's name should be changed to Republikken Nord-Makedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory, and has on several occasions opposed its bid for membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
The people's support, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's are ringing  the screams of Harlem are ringing
"The old people I talked to told me that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Adams.
Now there's none of the parts.
He said the bar's drop was understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways these days", he says.
Bar is no longer the meeting place of the local environment, which everyone visits regularly.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling properties won't last as long as the leaders think.
The churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who wouldn't help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he says, "and will therefore only hasten the day when these churches have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both cricks were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black metropol  Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had held to nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street  one of Harlem's main dealers  because they failed to employ or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when the father of Johnson's son-in-law made plans for the rebuilding, they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, the son of John's father and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was the church bell of the poor.
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the last few months is a complicated interplay between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are hired by the church's legends and others by the bishopric.
The church council's leadership, consisting of lay people, wrote to the bishopric in July concerning its concern that the bishopric was trying to force the costs on the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the bishopric.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of openness on the part of the bishopric.
Shark injures teenager on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he was searching for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought the boy was screaming with excitement over catching a lobster, but he realized later that the boy was screaming, 'I got bit!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was ripped up, says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported to be in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Badewatt captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a couple of weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles also said the victim sustained serious injuries to his upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty-pleaves, manned by specially trained co-workers.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a massive takeover of the UK's 2.8 million-strong beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth as sales of clothing and homewares fall.
The investment in the convenience store is the result of the supermarket's attempt to find a new use area for the space that was previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and homewares.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the number of beauty products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better placement in branded areas, in the same way as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique-smink brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an ever-increasing demand for this among younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a new trend to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, the managing director of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales are going to be more and more like a department store, with the supermarket taking on the competition from the cheap Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and goods besides food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos-outsale in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat-outsale after buying both chains two years ago, according to them, which has increased food sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The Supermarket's previous attempt to upgrade the department for beauty care and pharmaceuticals was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots early in the 2000s, but the partnership was terminated after a dispute over the distribution of income from the supermarket's pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 shop-booths to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain of pharmacies, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a selection of luxury fashion brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and design of beauty care shelves to create more welcoming environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will then be ready to provide advice and help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the welcoming surroundings and practical locations make us a beauty care competitor representing a new shopping experience.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of a deal worth ¬£11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who is program director at This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on his own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "racing" at an intense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where the television's gold maid admitted that her new agreements worth up to GBP 1.5 million meant she no longer had time to oversell their clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was unquestionably Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security for the next decade.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has chosen to withdraw.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday, just before the launch.
Now a warehouse full of goods stands at the headquarters in Marlow that is now ready for sale.
Experts believe the This Morning programme leader, who is among Britain's most popular stars, could come to cost the company several million pounds due to large investments in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and cosmetics, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on holiday together, and Jones has a 40 percent ownership stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday that we don't want to comment on his business dealings.
And then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for coming up with a comment some would consider lite president-actig, and for being so positive regarding the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
I haven't given away anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a "corresponding response" from the United States on its early disarmament efforts.
He noted that the United States instead has sanctions that aim to keep the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke to an assembly of his constituents.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his work to improve relations with Kim has yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket tests, helping to free hostages and getting the remains of American service personnel sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to perform with the dignity of the presidency, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this staggering arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the area directly in front of him.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia devastate an island and kill hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideological organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of Lombok's inhabitants had lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help. So it is quite challenging", Sumbung explained.
Save the Children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national agency for crisis management, said that Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Taken in consideration the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Lies to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a Palu warning, even though a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death tolls.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's falle-ready infrastructure a focal point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But money shortages have been a major problem for Jokos' administration, which is up for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have gone over to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equaliser in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball fell towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it on.
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker sent a pasting with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's halfway point.
Kovacic came with a quick surrender on the midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough passing that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and ran the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the men's European football league in London at 15.00 on Thursday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the state's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of materials from razed buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "We're at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact us. They may have information that is crucial to our investigation.
A spokesperson for the police confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a place of worship.
A weeping woman appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying, "It's so awful".
At 14 two police cars were behind the barrier, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the barrier and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to log 247 from 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell is the last monument to be drawn into the debate over rewriting history.
The removal of the statue would have been poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures that was carried out by his fanatical puritans.
But the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing house as "tame" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster palace also came to be a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the mistake Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the views of the 1800's and is part of the historiography of a man many still believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps later in the 19th century than today, as the parliament's defender against outside pressure. In his time, of course, the monarchy was the issue.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still subject to historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Killer pig takes the life of Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only mentioned by the surname Yuan, was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured pulsar near a binge at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005, in the city of Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the pigsty there was a big boil with blood on the mouth.
A medical investigation confirmed that the 250-kg pig had killed the man.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", explained the cousin, known by his last name Wu, in a quote to the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market's leaders explained that the pig was locked inside to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and the market's management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although it is rare, it is not the first time a pig has been recorded attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting serious injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig weighing 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to the usual, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
They're just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they don't try to hurt anyone.
You just have to show adequate respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest United States
As reported, the storm is weakened as it moves over the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will however bring with her floodwaters on her journey through north-Mexico and southwest-USA during the next few days.
Rosa had a wind strength of 135 km/h and was a category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, a trog begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching trough will lead to widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Dyptropic humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 57 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 510 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, particularly over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is danger of tropical rainfall.
Strong rain can cause bridle-deep, bridle-deep rivers to form, and thunderstorms can cause local windfalls that can contain dust and sand.
The approaching storm will bring local heavy rainfall to parts of the coastline along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating rusk and rapids, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some spread tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread to the cornerstates on Tuesday and continue throughout Wednesday.
October can bring some intense temperature swings across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics keep warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We're going to see a clear example of extreme temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next couple of days, the summer heat will continue to build up and expand.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States will likely get a warm start in October, with high degrees of twentieth from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States will most likely have higher than normal temperatures throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, distributed across six TV networks, watched Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's big surprise in the last second, when it emerged that the Arizona senator, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh assaulted her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The Friday broadcast was likely seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership was not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems measuring office visitors.
To give you some perspective, this is the number of viewers that corresponds to the final game of the American Football Championship or the Oscar-award.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-makers have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led the way among the networks, with an average viewership of 5.69 million for the daylong hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character for Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor, and on Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the courthouse while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes closed for several minutes while he was being screened out, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling our country the truth?
He heard that you have the power when so many women are powerless.
Flake pointed out that his office had come with a statement, and said as the elevators closed that he came to have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the judges' committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be carried forward to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after speaking with the Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU of playing "political games" with Britain's future and undermining the nation's interests.
Theresa May, the UK's Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed alongside her own on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "entirely ridiculous".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is being charged with premeditated murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS-partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish medical examiner released a preliminary report on Friday, listing the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police's task force for the recovery of the refugees, the state's police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for their contributions to the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for its "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times", Wade said.
Volcanoes spew ash over Mexico City
The ash that springs from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Desastres, Mexico's public agency for crisis prevention, warned the population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater rose and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over the course of a day.
The state government monitored several cases of rumbling and rusting.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the front roads of neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence clashed with police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on emancipation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the insurgent police, and bombed them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Handshakes also broke out later in the day, when the police used batons to limit the fighting.
For several hours, independence demonstrators stood shouting "Never forget, never forgive", face to face with unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed a overwhelming overtall for the release, but it was a poor meeting because the vote was boycotted by most who were against the release.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote that was held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held nonetheless, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy over the vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in the regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping the pressure up this year, as many of their well-known leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest to support the police, said the conflict was being stoked by politicians on both sides.
The situation is becoming more and more tense, he explained.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed in anticipation of a court case since late last year, announced that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
'Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the repression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government', he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An arm-wheel may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livinston was appalled by Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side now sits equal to Hibernian on second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win on the away side in the Premier League this season and will play against the Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home-and-away against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has held on to six games in the division, with Holt having yet to lose a game after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston goes missing opportunities against his sluggish guests
Holts' team would have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett's header past the goal.
The host allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for their guests at dead ball.
And that's how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave up a frispark and Livingston found an opening  Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a clear shot, and he scored a goal from mid-box.
Before this stage, Rangers had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team's defense had proved to be unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos scored a nestenscoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a wide passing.
Crosses came steadily into the Livingston box and were steadily saved, while two penalties  one time after Halketts protest against the innobytes of Glenn Middleton, and one time for hands  were overlooked.
Fenomenally from Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and they continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style and the team have hardly changed since they came out on top again, but Holt is to have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on toe hips throughout the entire match.
Rangers, on the other hand, didn't have my inspiration to share.
Although they have been very good at times under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the match was a slow one, as they only got into the home team's half once and it was a bit of a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police cited security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 people were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also let their voice be heard, criticizing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The contradictory demonstrations mirror the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autokrat by others.
Deptford collision: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist is killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford's southeast, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by an ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a car crash where the driver ran from the Childrens Street location, around one kilometer from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said they're working to identify the man and notify his family.
Roadblocks and buses are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security men's prison incident, according to the prison authorities.
The incident broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and is still ongoing.
Specialised Tornado officers are brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one fly.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "Specialised prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees are being treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (may be favorable for dry areas)
It's the first time Arizona has been hit by a tropical low pressure, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert areas of the southwest and brings with it flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainy season will start late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only ti tropical cyclones have maintained the status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 510 cm of rain, with up to 15 cm in some locations in the Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will likely get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood risk, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwest United States is currently in a drought-prone state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the Rosa hurricane makes landfall on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa has a maximum wind strength of 137 km, 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, and loses strength.
Therefore, it is expected that it will hit Mexico with tropical storm strength Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be powerful and cause great flood hazards.
Total rainfall of 7.515 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with possibilities of up to 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
The main threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This downburst is expected to produce life-threatening flooding and floating rubbish and rapids in the desert and earth-crushed in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found knifed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 04.00 BST on Sunday.
He was rushed to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who can have a mobile recording of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered under the petty and meanness of the Democratic Party
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered under the smallness and mindset of the Democratic Party throughout the nominating process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw how brilliant, skilful and courageous Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most accomplished jurists of our time, with impeccable public service", he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is that Republicans vote in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant, he said.
That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats' goal is to "resist and prevent".
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican Party aide to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunamis, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were swept out to sea by huge waves that thundered against the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-meter-high waves thundered in land around sunset, destroying everything in its path and drawing many into drowning.
The tsunami came on the heels of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, not immediately escaping and ending up as victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's crisis management agency (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone, it took cars, trestams and houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos published by the crisis management agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After a major earthquake, the coastline continued to shake on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Assessment and Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force of Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the state.
Nugroho described the damage as "encompassing" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could be larger than the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication was completely crippled, completely without information from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
On Saturday, the state government was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes tumbling towards the beach, ripping away buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hampered communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising above 800.
It's just awful.
World Vision personnel from Donggala have arrived safely to Palu city center, where they have sought shelter under a presenning tent on the yard in front of their office, but they passed major destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses", he said.
It's just awful.
As aid organizations began the grim preparations to deliver crisis aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with much expertise were denied travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial catastrophe, said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says 'Great, this is a national disaster' we can open the borders for international aid, but the situation has not yet got any status.
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the bleak news after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was caught out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed from rescue efforts after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding team's trainer, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the Palu beach festival.
But the messages only led to gray hook marks, rather than a couple of blue hook marks.
I think it means the messages weren't delivered, he said.
Thieves steal USD 26,750 during minibank filling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole USD 26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling a minibank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and was ready to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a money bag that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name  to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: The creature formerly known as Kanye West.
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a longer time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she was canceled on emosjonelt basis, according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.
He is one of many well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of bindestrek and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's incoming president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
Military troops shot down a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, in a period when left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number one in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double AI research budget would be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the US, and we're looking for the next big breakthrough", Lee said.
Doubling financial support could double the chance that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system for artificial intelligence that beat America's best Othello players, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese division.
Lee recognized the US government's previous technology competitions, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held, to help find the next generation of smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
"It's not China that's stealing the academic leaders, it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired brilliant minds from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered residence permits", he said.
China's state council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing more than $100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the American law enforcement agency that aims to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been stalled for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to Republikken Nord-Makedonia to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greek territory, and has vetoed its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new navel, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has created doubts about whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by ratifying the agreement with Greece?
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to gain membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a high enough number of parliamentarians have said they will abide by the results of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13.00.
The turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% at the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote because of my children, because we belong to Europe", said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who were going to boycott the vote.
"We are positive about NATO and the EU, but we want to be admitted with our heads held high, not let in the back way", says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a jobless rate of more than 20 percent.
'I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after voting.
He says that a yes answer will be a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey released last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of those eligible to vote will participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required number of votes.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of those who responded plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has faced since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manoeuvers past the whole of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pasting at the start of the sequence.
He ran a lap with three Brighton defenders before he came out on the open.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then sent a passing left that reached Sterling.
The English attacking midfielder used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to hit Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
We talked about him coming to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky he scored a goal right then.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, which was placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough passing along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues offensive player sent the ball into the net just before it was over the line of scrimmage.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for the Rockies
The Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet hard.
The always-like competitive Scherzer hopes to still stand on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff chances of the Colorado-team, which leads over the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies earned a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but are still out after securing their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, is going to be what's most likely going to be the highest level of play I'm going to get this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of it?
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but will likely be inclined to take Scherzer's pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has this season won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's state assembly in West Virginia
The President referred discrete to the situation around high-level nominee Brett Kavanaugh while he talked about how important it is that Republicans vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetimes.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power at any cost, and you see the petty and the mean.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, aim to "resist and prevent".
And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "crazy and bad and disgusting and dishonest".
He referred to the senate's judges' committee and named the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by name, whereupon the audience buzzed.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for one. That was really bad body language.
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am, after all, the last of a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I would be censored for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of having responsible economic policies, as for national security, as for Europe -- ironically, similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just this.
This is unfortunately no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of a "softer, friendlier" politics is too long forgotten, if it ever began at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I had previously thought shared many political views with suddenly started expecting me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, but they were about national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public and it doesn't matter what I say, I get a lot of nasty messages on social media demanding my removal, condemning centre-right politics and telling me I shouldn't be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's been through this.
I know I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get are usually political.
I know how professional and determined these colleagues are when they face a sea of gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but they never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross exfoliation has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer a party that is open to all, and every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules narrows the party.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years, being told to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because that would make everything better.
But that was not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government which had led to my classroom at the public school I attended being literally doomed, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the representative's motion on Friday, I would just say that as our country races towards a Brexit that will hurt individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum - it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political intransigence will prevent me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38  17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastically entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only undefeated team out of the ten.
Ultimately, it was their superior defense as well as their ability to use the opportunities they got that led to the home team's victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
"We've been challenged in our battles so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied with that", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "All credit to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were".
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, with a goal from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the playing field, and Jason Baggot scored a goalless try.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalties kick before he, just before the break, scored and goal kicked a solo attempt to change the position to 175 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with a goalscoring kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Thereafter, there was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on a boat, and from the start Ayr increased its lead even more with a try from Stafford McDowell, with a goal from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of the opportunity to have an extra man on the field to the fullest with a goalless attempt from Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team came back strongly, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown by injecting behind the advancing Ayr-maul.
Climo delivered a goal kick, as he did again almost entirely from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the service industry. It was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with a shelf-life.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, for which he writes the script and plays alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it looks like Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to involve himself in Glasgow's livlige restaurant business.
The ocean is ours: Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrolling a riggins-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.
The entire inland state of Bolivia still remembers the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800's, and the country longs to once again sail the Pacific.
These hopes are perhaps greater than they have been for decades, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has drive, community spirit and calm, and of course it is waiting for the result with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling from the International Court of Justice on large screens at many different locations in the country, in the hope that the Court in The Hague will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile  after several decades of sporadic negotiations  is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native-born president who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also invested heavily in Monday's sentiment.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's side, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN body, which is based in the Netherlands, has no authority to give away Chilean land areas, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling from the International Court of Justice came only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated, according to Paz Z√°rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
The problem of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration, said Z√°rate.
She believes Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has teared away all eventual remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations on one or another point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Veltz√©, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile and the opportunity to put a stop to 139 years of disagreement, to the benefit of both parties.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political scaffolding.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust U.S. authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honor the promises they made during a meeting between the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
These comments come as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo looks set to launch the atomic diplomacy, more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a wish-fulfilling dream that continued sanctions and American resistance to a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever force North Korea to its knees.
American authorities are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first undertaking significant down-rust measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to release an arsenal the country probably sees as the only security guarantee it has.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headgear, which is on its way to a clothing store near you.
If you want some big addition to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, look no further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of rare, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel fans at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most eye-catching piece was an over-the-top beige hat decorated with a feather-like broad brake that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-printed watermelons, a trollman's hat or even an ananas, but they are not made to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had reshaped lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than last scream.
One creation was reminiscent of diving equipment, including snorkels and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted icing cream in a cake.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the giant hats may be heading to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly unpractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another big creation down the catwalk  a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the bathing suit model who wears it.
The orange raffia bag, which is edged with raffia fringes and completed with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Show.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer. When the designer has had such a big impact, it will be hard to overlook the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland's free schools are showing continuing academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another year of outstanding exam results, underpinned by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Frisco Council), have more than 30 000 pupils across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both pupils and parents.
Friskoler aims to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words hit his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the A-level exam.
The data, obtained from the 74 member schools of the friskoler√•d, showed that 72 percent of students received the A-level exam in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This illustrates that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject is now valued at the same level as real subjects such as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that of the reasons employers gave for having problems with filling a vacant position, 17 per cent could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these life-long skills will provide real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those linked to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if every school teaches in a different language.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages considered most valuable for the UK on the road to 2020, e.g. Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a choice of languages at the preschool, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish Free Schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that language is still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should actually be considered international communication capability.
Friskoler will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to Scotland's youth.
I'm going to do it right.
John Edward is the Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still not decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season fights at this stage of my career", he replied.
Timing of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
The President is starting a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned rallies over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected high-level candidate is on hold, Trump's goal is to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the ballot box in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19:00 ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault, and a confirmed vote is expected to be held in the next week while the FBI investigates the case.
The main goal of all these meetings is to support Republicans who are facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has said that the five public meetings over the next few weeks are aimed at "inciting volunteers and supporters" as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move into a busy campaign season", Reuters was told by a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
The evening's popular meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw support players from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh-press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in opinion polls.
"It's a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows a fighting spirit to keep the faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been just what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but it's something that players really believe in, especially at competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we're carrying that with us as a bit of momentum", said Jordan Spieth as he left the field for the day.
Europe will, of course, have the advantage. They lead by four points and there are 12 to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel like they've got a little bit of wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent play from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration cries became higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putting to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were two under two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream of the sort that shows that he still doesn't believe that the American team is chanceless.
"We really just have to put all the pieces together and focus on our own match", Spieth said.
That's all each of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the Ryder Cup's greatest success stories.
Europe's unusual but wonderful couples have four out of four and don't miss a step.
Moliwood was the only pair to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there is no other player the public will see secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
It is still too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hammered easily with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs-hero, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so far off the mark that they had no nubbesjans to take back the advance.
But on Sunday, there is no help to be had.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes-event also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe leads 106 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cup final day, having completed Sunday's fourballs- and foursomes-matches with 106 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their points for Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bj√∏rn's European side, who are fighting to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unlikely side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 31.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they did not get to take back anything of the advance.
Jim Fury's side must collect eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked seamlessly to knock down Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who held out through two matches on Saturday, glimpsed to the occasional, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested to the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and delivered a 2&1-win performance against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked as number one and three on the world basis.
But Europe did not get everything it wanted on this hot day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2&1-over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to pull back after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders, only Fury's side need to achieve a tie to retain the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn't look like they'll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will not agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened mistrust of the United States, and that the country would not agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Health Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea has taken significant well-intentioned steps over the past year, including halting atomic and missile tests, dismantling the atomic test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen any similar response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not under any circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to gradual nuclear disarmament, with North Korea being rewarded for gradual disarmament, but his declaration was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done previously.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim promised to work toward atomnedrusting of the Korean peninsula, while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its atomic weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on atomic disarmament first, and raises pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal with force, and opposes itself to even the 'declaration of war's end', according to Ri.
The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae during the last five months, adding: "If the other party in this disarmament issue were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as tightly locked as it is".
The tone of Rice's speech was however very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland-USA with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, Trump stood before the United Nations this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take the arms reduction step, but said much work still remains, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is atomically disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn't have a time frame for this, and said that "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must still be enforced forcefully and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb the financing of Pyongyang's atomic and missile weapons programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after North Korea accused him of coming up with "gangster-like demands".
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a missile area as well as an atomic weapons facility if the United States took "equivalent action".
He said Kim had said that these "equivalent measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures for normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard are taking a course in getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing culture of puffing through the night with caffeine as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world's best universities often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
After I finished, a girl came to me and said, "Why didn't anyone tell me this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important it is to have good sleep habits for academic and athletic performance, and for the general public.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there's a picture of a room in a dormitory where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is to have a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons gets participants to think about their own daily routine.
We realize that this isn't going to change student behavior immediately.
But we think they have a right to know about this, just as you have a right to know about the risks of smoking", said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a certain pride in being able to pug all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being an increasing problem.
He said that enough and good sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even as a means against weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, which leads to a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, taking one of the professor's classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work on a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master's students to take a similar programme before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set alarms for when to go to bed and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal by Menga knocks out Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Menga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to get their first win since February's 41 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership-leading Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to level.
Rangers now fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after a subject was thrown from a bortepublikum.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances for the team, sweeping Ayr past the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy for how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They were to have scored just two minutes into the match when Menga's first passing sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder forfeited the chance.
A long frispark by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the goalpost.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game leaned more on hope than faith on the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was going to get a penalty kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tamed kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis' opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game's pace, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head cold when he chose out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player change gave immediate results when the wingman sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett catching up long ball after long ball.
Holts side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' Glenn Middleton had a late claim to penalties as he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson go.
The Almanak: The Inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the Geiger counter.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and was also a part of the popular culture via the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals is emitting.
Evans: "Should I say it's making a sound now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he named lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory.
The cells can now see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then inject it back into the patient.
A vaccine under trial has shown promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting those cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the following: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 drives the growth of different types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immun cells were taken from the patient and oppl√¶rt to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with a heated defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a stunning performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he leant out against the Democrats and reiterated that he supported Trump.
It happens so often that I talk to a white person and he says, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headgear.
They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They were bullying me!
And then they said I don't understand what reality is, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see that I understand what reality is?" He said, and he said he'd put me in the Superman jacket, because then no one could tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His comments were bowed at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked shameless, Variety reported, with a staff member telling: The whole studio was dead-still.
West was brought in as the last minor replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a couple of days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR STARING AGAINST THE MASS.
But Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just who he is and that's absolutely amazing.
But I choose not to reward anyone by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their art) which I believe cultivates and spews out ideologies that are harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was being formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and so has the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The target is expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is out against "gifthish masculinity".
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often make young men believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very interested in the subject.
"It's worrying me a lot these days", he said. "Where did the masculinity go wrong?"
How have we raised men for the problems we see today?
Kit believes that TV may have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strongly masculine roles.
He continued: What is innate and what is learned?
What is being broadcast on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this particular side of being a man?
I think that's one of the really big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong for young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any forerunner or successor to Game of Thrones when the series concludes next summer, and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the lead role in a new casting of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones, is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recording, so that way something good came out of it", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kits role-playing character Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslies' family estate in Scotland.
China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 percent in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a shift from earlier cases.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way is now close to zero, said a Chinese health official at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year by year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men, after each, marry women.
Much of the disease transmission is due to inadequate protection from sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that co-workers leaked data on Republican senators, flies by dangerous liars and conspirational theories
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected accusations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat was assured of the claims by ultrakonservative commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a lie", Waters continued.
Members of my staff - whose identities, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these dishonest and false allegations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be aggressive.
They must not go in defense.
They must not doubt the motives of the accuser.
They have to act calm and understanding.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant authorities and the police of these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for any actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff".
Announcement by Johnny English Strikes Again  Bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit-hintings in all new films with a British slant and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parodifranchisee Johnny English actioncomedy  which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-emerged in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satire about how obviously hopeless we are become the nation's new export?
Anyway, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has gotten his license renewed to rote it to for the second time  his name says more than anything else that he is a distinct and comic figure intended for territories with non-English speaking cinemaopublikum.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one single note to the fire engine theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mysterious man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one or two great moments in the latest Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades slashed his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its end, but the humor feels rather bloodthirsty and oddly superfluous, especially now that the serious brands like 007 and Mission Impossible willingly take their cues from comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and to me Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and spicy as the silent films of Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web-network of spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guarding agent  a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and down-to-earth figure who's already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of Theresa May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she must bring in some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a fancy establishment, but teaches informally in secret intelligence.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, plagued helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spliced with an underwater commander, a hysterical overclass-dominated role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat of a waste.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on assignment for the queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's fantastic femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technologimillionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber-problems: the lumsky Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin the journey with farcical side-springs: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flaming French restaurant, create chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers anarchy when he attempts to use a VR headset to make a name for himself in Volta's house.
All the stops are really drawn out before the final sequence, but even as lovely and noisy as it is, it's a lot like children's TV with all that stuff.
It's pretty mediocre, the whole thing.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies plans to let Britons work four-day weeks but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is to consider a radical plan that would give the British a four-day workweek but get paid for five.
The party wants business leaders to use their savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekday off.
It will mean that the employees get a three-day shelter, while they get the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party's desire to let the pendulum swing to the workers' advantage, in addition to the party's overarching industrial strategy.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign ahead of the 2017 parliamentary election.
The idea is not supported by the whole Labour party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day week is not the party's policy, and is not something that is considered by the party".
Finance policy spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "faceless directors" and "profit directors" of public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting back the entire share capital because a Labour government can take a "fradrag" from perceived unfairness.
He also confirmed plans to place workers in company boards and to create employees' funds to transfer 10 % of the private sector's own capital to employees, who can get an annual profit of ¬£500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh may change their minds
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview that aired Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley of "60 Minutes" asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, certain, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be cut in stone.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it must be a startling finding", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it vigorously, Graham added, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change that.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission: to eradicate world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring thousands of people to the great plaza of Central Park, not only to experience the greatness of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or actions, such as volunteer work, sending e-mail to a world leader, taking a phone call or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when we're only 12 years away from achieving our goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called click-activism -- that people feel they're making a big contribution by signing up for an online campaign or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million actions from supporters, with a wide range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to show 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured financing has had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main engagements are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK that will help children to reach their full potential, and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In answer to one of the most common questions on the website, what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?
Global citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road. Sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon√°e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US may use its navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can, if necessary, resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's engagement in Syria, particularly when they operate at the invitation of the lawful government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe", he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
The US has the ability through the Navy to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an idealistic organization that profiles itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far from identical.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia as "one trick pony" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, seeking to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
Workers in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the upassing project The North European Gas Pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's fange.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar North European gas pipeline, which is to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's glowing resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unrealistic competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have big problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During a vote in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the shaken government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm going to seriously consider running for president.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election and said he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the core about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his high-profile nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI review before the vote".
A poll published on Thursday shows, however, that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be silent, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported her candidacy.
The opinion poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make his decision officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have brought with them", she told the audience at a Donald Trump election event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest the elephant in the room and said of his son and other war veterans: "They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home wondering if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and flyers and all other members of the military have contributed to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, clothing violations with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support trial of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from amicus curiae (friends of the law) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been made public.
She claimed that her partner and his violent gang member sons abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations with pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the immigration court that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy is "looking back from many decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to that principle, said the orientation from the amicus curiae.
The lawyers argued further in the orientation that the policy of denying immigrants access harms the US economy and says there is a high probability that they will become more entrepreneurial and contribute with necessary labour force".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in the June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems -- even the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu  death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It was very emotional", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is comforting her son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
You see ambulances picking up the dead all the time.
Clean water is scarce.
You could see residents coming to ruined homes and looking through water-damaged property in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke her back and shoulder, are outside Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing powerful aftershocks.
He tears as he recounts how he felt when the tremendous earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get to safety.
I was squeezed by the wall that was coming together, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of harassment with propaganda ads
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that described the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the China Daily attachment paid for to move into the Des Moines Register  the most-selling newspaper in Iowa  after having accused China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said, according to Reuters.
It is indeed normal for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has brought new round of tolls on each other's imported goods.
China's penalties early in the trade war were to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader's entry in Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are exploiting the freedom of speech and the open press that we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing, you don't find many dissenting opinions and don't get to experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese about China's troubled economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added: "One of China's largest newspapers declined the offer to publish his article, even though he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters ahead of midterm with Kavanaugh's fades, analysts warn
As many top politicians among Republicans support and defend the high-profile candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will get a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiments around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes' (R-Arizona) proposal for an FBI review at the last second will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget yesterday's events, they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the Senate corridors when the Republicans, who control the Justice Committee, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Demokratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, particularly among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which gave detailed description of the sexual assault charges against the high-powered candidate, analysts believed there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
"This has become a very bad thing for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh gets appointed, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of democratic candidates, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat split over who they should believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41% of those questioned were completely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's presentation.
In addition, 38 percent said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flake outing, the FBI is investigating claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford explained to the Senate's justiskomit√© during oath last week that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, had assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the high-profile candidate exposed her genitalia while they were at a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal is world dominance.
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to let people create their own personal data warehouse online or a POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal data storage online is that it's entirely up to the user who has access to that kind of information.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, processes and relevant competence to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to introduce something completely new, which will cause their business models to be completely reversed overnight.
We don't ask for your permission.
In an entry on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts' mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoriakors from the First World War
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victoriakors during the First World War as a combatant, was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Oberstl√∏ytnant and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honorific on 29 September 1918 at the battles of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was however killed by a snikskytter four days later and never got to know that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two children at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said it was a "flot symbolism" that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September, through very thick fog and under heavy protection from field guns and masking guns.
Later he steered against the line of fire and led the line with great force against in the future before storming a field gun and striking out three of the divisions.
Oberstl√∏ytnant Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I knew I could never live up to, but something that humiliates me.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to play a role in the parade, adding: "The courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people".
MMA fans were up all night watching the Bellator 206 fighting game, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night watching the tight-packed Bellator 206, only to discover you're missing the main event.
The San Jose participant made it through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in the UK were sitting to mow when the picture suddenly showed Peppa Pig.
Some were less impressed after having kept themselves awake until early morning to see the match.
One follower described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a sick joke".
"It's state regulation that it's not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
Pigs, yes!
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said they will work on the broadcast plan to include viewers in Great Britain in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the rematch", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there, and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday your time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we crossed, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly the friendly kind.
We tried to fix it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to cut back from the six to five games that we usually broadcast and we tried to reach far for the fans, but we tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of his sexuality
Olympic sprinter Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality  but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until at the youth school that he realized he wasn't like the others.
In the first programme Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that being a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual program leader for the tradition-rich program, Kirsty Young, is due to be away for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared as a bit of a loser on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else he grew up with because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, it's these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have given me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist and has become a highly-profiled LGBT ambassador, using his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he's standing up because he feels he's lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age -- he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012 since he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life", he said, "to be in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, the best feeling ever".
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small  which meant a lot to him in the upkyring before the Olympics and which still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's weakness takes him to the Ryder Cup golf tournament Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he's got to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial for an impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome matches.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he so often had been for the United States, the five-time major winner splits the day between being a leader and working on his game at the rank in the hope of straightening things out.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect form for the tight Le Golf National track, where the long rough-area still punishes erratic strokes.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, meets former British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points under before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game may prove to be completely decisive.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day", Furyk said.
He has great self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams before, and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldos' record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, and he likes to play games with other people. He's a great guy to have in the storage room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun trying out against him this week too, and it was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just the game.
European team captain Thomas Bj√∏rn knows that his great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj√∏rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance to the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but scored the winner with the least possible margin, 141‚ÅÑ2-131‚ÅÑ2.
"You're still reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far", said Bj√∏rn, photographed after watching Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you've got the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I've been saying all along that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side.
Bj√∏rn is very pleased with how his players have fared on the tough golf course and adds: I couldn't have done it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements will be at the centre, and that's something else entirely.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is put to the test.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he's got to go out and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bj√∏rn, opposing player Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals of the last day, and was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as the loser when Europe performed the mirakelet at Medinah.
I remember every damned word of it, he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had herded with his players at the entrance to the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like we experienced at Brookline, like we saw at Medina.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle struggles.
We'll arrange our setup then and send the people out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the match and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top-flight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player roster.
"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way", Bj√∏rn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
The German Navy's newest frigate was to have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it won't happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The ship was to have been surrendered to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ordered by the Navy back in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from homeport.
Still delays mean, however, that the advanced warships  they were told were to give Germany strength on the sea  will already be outdated before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F-125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media mentioned a number of important programware- and hardware defects that made the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The programming defects were particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class's vessels were operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces the performance and limits the opportunities of the navy to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class that were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag on the entire project  including training of the crew  has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chief of the German government's defense committee, confirmed that the navy is actually "going empty" for usable ships.
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were being run over, but no new vessels were coming.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the navy.
National Trust eavesdropping on the secret lives of the flagger mice
New research being carried out at a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will uncover how flaggermuse uses the landscape in the hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help shape future conservation efforts.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common flaggermus and dwergflaggermus as well as brunlang√∏re and waterflaggermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flagger mouse activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts' sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of flagger mouse calls and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS's conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the flagger mice and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be incorporated into the decision on what measures should be introduced, such as the establishment of a pasture and the best way of taking care of the forest for flagger mouse and other associated species.
The flagger mouse population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has sunk considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by building and construction work that affects younger places and the encroachment of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fluepapir and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
The bat is not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they use their ears more than their eyes to catch prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes flaggermus very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping of young places and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own flagger mus reservation at Threave land estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flagger mus species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a perfect area for bats", he says.
We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses how important it is to map the flagger muses before it is carried out maintenance on a property since the unwarranted destruction of one single young place can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps exterminate an entire local population.
Flagger mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their nesting grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish co-worker for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help with the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we simply don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as "fake news" and says people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The attacking midfielder for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her 375,000 dollars in the aftermath for keeping close to the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the accusations as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they said today, fake news, says five times winner of the Golden Ball into the camera.
They want to be famous by using my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm doing fine, the football player adds with a smile.
Ronaldos' lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable display of misgivings in the private sphere", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says the football player will demand compensation for omd√∏mmeskader in a scale that corresponds to the severity of the offence, which is likely to be one of the most serious breaches of the personal protection system in later years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone back to the football player's room, where he allegedly allegedly raped her anal, according to documents presented to the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99% a good person who was let down by the one percent.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they settled outside the court because she was afraid of revenge and was also worried about being publicly hanged.
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put the settlement aside because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will mourn for ever over loss of car manufacturers
Britain will grieve forever if it loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concernful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the consequences of delayed border crossing in a possible no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant  which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis  produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see, in my view, production at our factory stop, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says for example that they will close the Mini-factory at Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "custom order" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there could be a delay at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Brexit plan for further links with the EU is presistly set up to avoid such controls at the border.
"We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to seize that opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The message, not just from Toyota but from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that increased costs on the long run would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back".
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Vice Justice Rod Rosenstein may be delayed a week while the fight around high-powered candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of presidential right-to-work.
The question of whether or not Trump will dismiss the vice justice minister, threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up the conversation with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month, he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who at the time was at the United Nations in New York, would take place Thursday.
Trump said he would "best" avoid kicking Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI review of one week's charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week postponement because of everything that's going on with the Supreme Court".
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press updated.
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Programmer Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to dislike of TV reporters' self-righteousness, although she added: "I don't disagree that they are self-righteous".
Then she hinted that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
"The president is doing more questioning than any previous president", she said, adding without providing any evidence: "We've looked at the numbers".
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it would definitely be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it more frequent, and you've seen that we've done it more frequently in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open appointments or press conferences with important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he made a solo run and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and a wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish member of parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence and work permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have been ongoing throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution by the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise to strengthen and improve health services for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessean.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
"He came out on the sideline and kind of just collapsed there", Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a barge and taking him with them for further examination.
A Tennessee State functionary told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no information on the type/size of the damage yet and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles Saturday before he finished the game, giving him a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher documentation fee when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher documentation fee when they buy property in the UK.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters.
The document tax increase will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Experts at the Treasury Department expect it to raise up to ¬£120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher documentation fee when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The initiative will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more affordable housing and target high-income groups.
The document tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's efforts to help the homeless.
The surplus  which comes in addition to the current documentation charge, including the higher tax introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchase for out-of-home rentals  can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to spend up to ¬£120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents, driving up prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, particularly in the capital, have become ghost towns because of the many foreign buyers who mostly live outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson came up with proposals for reducing the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large building firms of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's shameful housing policy.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a sensational number of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unfounded evictions.
He also wants to give the municipalities more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions to our declining housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it cannot be as easy for non-UK residents and foreign-based companies to buy housing as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too distant, and the undignified situation of the homeless persists.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scot is delighted with the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I was often with my father and saw Scotland in the Hamptons as a child, and there's always something that pulls me back.
That opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the club leadership.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League".
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short stint in Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to re-enter the third division and helped St Mirren from the bottom of the table to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a proper roadkill, he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
I really thought that leadership was the right thing for me, more than acting.
It sounds weird since I did well, made a decent living out of it and experienced some nice highs.
But playing football can be tough.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but the leadership feels right to me.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and it feels like the most comfortable thing I've ever known in my entire adult life.

The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of Britain's hard-pressed pubs, but left more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a turnover increase of 2.7 % in July, while the revenues for restaurants fell by 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who summarized the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 % in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Drinks-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Pubs with foodservice also had a hard time with the sun, although it wasn't as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6.6 % that month, with foodservice down 3 %.
Paul Newman, analyst at the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, stated: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and large sports and social events are still the most important factors in terms of out-market turnover.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still having a hard time, and a turnover fall of 4.8 % year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for foodservice companies, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a much-needed respite.
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyses the results from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of ¬£9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children  some are only 11 years old  have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 youth school students uncovered fake Insta pages.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a "main" account that they show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 youth school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, a reference to image sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being shared.
20% of the students said they had an innocent "main" account that they show to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to rape me.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-old pupils had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the freediving team in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role on the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated freedman, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive experiences on international level over the last ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide sporting environment and we are confident that Scottish sporting fans will enjoy her membership", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to serve as a voice for the athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to the running of the sport in Scotland".
She won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, and is now a BBC expert, and after suffering a passing ischemic attack, she was unable to walk.
She tweeted: "A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be rehabilitated and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am fine again and have learned to walk again, and today I am doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!
Breast pump ads that compare mothers to cows divide online opinion
A breast-pumping company has split the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first soundless breast pump that is worn tightly to the body, Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirtatious, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of high and low to a song with the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't get it, this isn't jur, it's my nipples".
The choir goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls".
The announcement, published on the firm's Facebook page, has, however, created a storm on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it undermines the "crudities" of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.
Elvie's breast pump gets a nice place in a breast-bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?
Another added: "For a failed ad".
Others defend the ad, with one woman admitting that she finds the song "unbelievably funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product, if anyone wrote it.
Another commented: This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at the workplace or toilets) and feel like kuer.
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is however completely still, has no wires or slings and gets a nice place in a breast-feeding bra, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible freedom that the new pump provides.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret.
The number of detained migrant children has been on the rise, even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most of the support players have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and making demands on a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to inject fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an over-all officer with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals who sought to be supporters of single minors.
The bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a previously criminal record.
Nearly 80 % of the people who are either support workers or members of the household of support workers are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep going after these people", Albence says.
The officers are trying to handle the children faster and introduced new rules that suggest some of them must appear in court within one month of being arrested, not 60 days as was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via videoconference instead of meeting up in person to bring their case about residence permits for an immigration judge.
Those considered as unqualified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape, according to receptionists and reports that have emerged in the system over the past few months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them sufficient time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can reinforce traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish occupation powers to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the vice-minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the cover of fighting terrorism and would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is over in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and several million are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue to carry on this holy struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories both for terrorist groups and for all foreign presence.
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused certain Western countries of spreading irrational refugees that keep refugees away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They politicize what is really a purely humanitarian situation.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no support will be given to Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffersone in the rebels' last major defense position at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province, which is home to three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had clearer deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who would be wiped out.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon call for the first meetings of a new committee made up of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to the review of the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Another Term
According to that logic, Trump would have won reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the riksrett and the scandal do an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At the moment there is no sign of seizure fatigue.
Since 2014, the viewership for best-of-three series has doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has topped cable ratings with a whopping 3.5 million viewers on nights of major news events.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything", said Neal Baer, program director for the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh".
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the events in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Admission is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way to being an enlightened human being when you sit for six hours to watch a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep diving" as a backdrop for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich feathered leather jacket, and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
I don't want to watch Super Mario the same way anymore.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump show's varying cast and daily twists on the plot.
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be stuck.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees and sunny outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and watched MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't rip himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate's justice committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization", Fleiss said.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Money from outside is flowing into the steepest midterm elections to the House of Representatives.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a cash flow after a reversal of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This recently newly-appointed Pittsburg suburb is contesting the Democratic nomination of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a supplemental election last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which in high degree overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was pulled up again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were a lawless manipulation of the electoral circuits in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign finance between the largest party-funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed supplemental election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress in March of last year.
The seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
The United States considered punitive measures against El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump Organization's leadership team.
Officials at the Department of State decided to recall the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. assistance in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penal measures, which included cuts in economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the effort to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which halted all plans for punitive action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration places on the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or punitive action from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the coffin could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which there is now very solid evidence for in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly in the process of expanding the investigation into whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to shift sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the midst of preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it for his European counterparts.
There are choices that must be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History turns on such tipping points, and the unforgiving march of democracy is accelerated or hindered.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points right now.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tough spot ever since this newspaper reported that he last year suggested secret eavesdropping by the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says that The Times' presentation is incorrect.
How will we react if the recently initiated FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible abuse allegations and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy faces a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to give up, because of the experience I had in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to the asylum to light the Sabbath candles on the cross-hatched table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty that victory over the Austrians after the impressive match-fixing in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game thinking we could do something and got a point.
Maybe we could have nodded at the end, but the tie was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd behind me I'm sure we can stand and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on it now, put the last season behind us and make it happen.
Women lose sleep at night because of the fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their families about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want to be taken care of by someone in their family, but they're not doing anything to take that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with the counsellor and the family where and how the care is to be provided.
Bring your financial adviser: The financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets  if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Avoid legal problems immediately.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to oversee your medical care and reassure yourself that healthcare professionals will respect your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone power of attorney over your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in a report so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake". "Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What medicines do you need?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep that overview in place.
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun as he was on his way home after an outing.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a umotivert action.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have requested witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death tolls are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to get information from Donggala regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest part of Sulawesi.
The Regentship, an administrative region under provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of Sulawesi's economy, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency aid administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Ildringen in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hit the Aceh regency of Pidie Jaya and caused devastation and panic while people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, conspiracy to commit rape and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su varetekts prison for an unsecured debt letter worth 500 dollars, KTUU reported.
He was presented to court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, absolutely" when asked how he stood to the question of guilt, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A felonies, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a fine of up to $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with aggravated assault against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being tried in the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and deaths are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered over the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terror attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycleway along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he meets down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "deliberately" and caused serious bodily injury with intent, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point indictment, with eight counts of money-laundering-related murder, on Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and one count of assault and theft of a motor vehicle.
The attack required "significant planning and planning", said the actor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "hideous, cruel and corrupt".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could give death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were "openly disappointed" over the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked the prosecution authorities not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the people's army today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians would feel the pressure from the eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that Britain would have been wiped out now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go ahead with trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setbacks and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the Kaos.
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Br√ºssel.
If he had the responsibility, we'd be out by now, he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan".
When he was asked to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected claims that the people's opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The view that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I say quite simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are taking to the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Throw away the Brexit plan and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage said that politicians would feel the pressure if they thought about betraying the 2016 referendum.
"This is about trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour political rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis taunted the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app as the conference started.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the future during a council meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been central to the speculation about whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the council house format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed in a shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and later died as a result of it, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene and carrying a weapon, admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish political chamber.
Sims was a six-foot-tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for the world championship title after stalling orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stall orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole Bottas got a good start and nearly swept Hamilton off the field while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to drive in the rear of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari-driver reluctantly let the inside be free after a double pass to defend himself in the third swing.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as the No. 7 at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led in large parts of the race while he was on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He eventually came to the depot on the 44th round, but failed to increase the tempo in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a proper gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good tospann, said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a Saturday political event for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate's justiskomit√©, commenting instead that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are ondsinned, fools and speak untruth.
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on these past few days in the Senate, is when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and mean and ugly and talking untruth", he said.
When you look at the releases and the leaks, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I haven't done that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer -- you leaked the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I'm not going to.
I haven't leaked it.
Hey, wait a minute.
"Leaked we... no, we didn't leak", he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked.
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who during the party event Saturday night commented: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his continued defense of the high-level candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to get power and control, the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants were early to get a two-goal lead via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back from a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyers opened in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford dropped the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt allowed up to Cownies's outright match at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead by pause when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team re-grouped and Bouchard equalised once again with a masterly goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the late second-half match, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth halfway out in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died and ensured that a plane carrying many hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to terrorise the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swaying control tower at the airfield Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to see that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved many hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard that", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness body says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach, said the organ's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "We see ambulances picking up the dead all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Minimarket is being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after plane crashed in lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia says one man is missing, and earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that there was one male passenger per Saturday afternoon they did not have oversight over.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airfield on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane crashed on the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through mid-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a bridge also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft over the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts lay out the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors ended the procedure Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
United States Analyst in the Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert witness on the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile printouts to puzzle together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening she died, something that was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went into the witness box Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the actor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said he lied because my trailer was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for around two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records suggest they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is socially engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to taking up social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make socially engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new upswing in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York baby-sitters suing couples for termination after racist report
A New York child care worker sues a couple for discriminating after receiving a misrepresented message from her mother, who complained that she was enda a black person.
The couple dismisses their claims of racism, and compare the suit to utpressing.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEII ENDA A BLACK PERSON", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, a ukomfortabel Plasco-Flaxman told Maurice to stop, claiming that their childcare provider, who was an African American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for his one day's work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the termination and demands compensation in the order of 350 dollars per day for the six-month, losji-based arrangement she was promised, however without contract.
"I wanted to show them that, hey, you just don't do that", she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have turned back on the accusations that they are Rastafarian and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing to do, as they felt they could not trust her after having offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist, said the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn?
Come on now.
The comparison of the lawsuit with utpressing says Plasco was due to his wife only having two months to term and was in a swert difficult situation.
Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
It's not particularly pretty, add the stock broker.
While the legal case is going on, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington's publisher feared readers wouldn't accept a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was supposed to be published, said of the letter: "It's difficult to put yourself in someone else's shoes when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success.
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a tiny teddy bear, would have been greatly pleased that his work had been rejected.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not a boastful person", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid do something: you're proud of it even though it's not really your fault.
I think he viewed Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
Upon landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive, Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while before and her organs were folding.
I just had to sit there and wait, certain that it was going to happen.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together.
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who did not know the ordeals she was going through.
"No one knew", she says.
I looked down the whole time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards of mourning women preventing suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was struck by depression and took his own life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day", she says.
Sharon, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room.
He quit his job before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his own life.
Sharon says, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to be a shit effect".
Sharon made the cards to tell people that there are people out there that they can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit by yourself - you have to talk to someone.
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me that he was feeling down or depressed or anything", she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in mood.
On Christmas Day, he was in the basement, and when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn't get eye contact or anything.
She says his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: It rips up a big hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to persevere and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for, a time- and scope-bound investigation, we might be able to come to some agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would fall apart along fixed party lines.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th. If the Republicans presumably do it badly, it will be significantly more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling around to senators and lobbying them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him installed in the high court.
The number of North Korean hoppers falling under Kim
North Korean hoppers to South Korea have fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's assembly department, said there had been 1127 hops last year compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of the North Koreans who drop out are later offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the hoppers to be illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for an atom-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the high-court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the high court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's justice committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, sometimes almost screaming and crying when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He was also strongly critical of the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not sit in the Supreme Court since it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with statements like that and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to run Kavanaugh for Congress if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but in the court he sits on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overrule certain high-level decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partisan person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it", Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous rage, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that weird, do you?
She goes on to say, "I got great help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was amazing.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for resentment partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office, where I started crying in inexplicable rage and was grabbed by an older woman -- a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of -- and dragged to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry and be happy that they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed for cheating on his wife aboard a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way of investigating the possibilities of running for president himself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it was near the end of the campaign, she was behind on the funding and vowed that she would not shut down if she didn't get in 2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of the cheerleaders who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or what?" she wondered.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with feelings -- gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism -- that she fell down in tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder of how the press was talking about her.
You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What would they write on my tombstone?"
She cried?
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening voices of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by levying a toll on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation happened this week with new tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars, which means tariffs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated every time, most recently with a five to ten percent levy on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match the United States attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not raise the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure around the trade war with the United States could yield positive long-term outcomes for China by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ring effects in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have previously realized", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ready for refugee return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, which is devastated after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke in the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism", he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country, who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional assistance or help from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup wins in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final result of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bj√∏rn scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
USA star Phil Mickelson, who was in the middle of the tournament, hit his tee-shots in the water at par-3 16th hole, and was knocked out by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became one of only four golfers to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament took its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbj√∏rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most successful European player with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the staff to his fellow countryman John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods. I followed that man closely growing up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career point record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-precision golf throughout the entire tournament.
The United States team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
That was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I'm gonna look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take your hat off.
We were beaten.
