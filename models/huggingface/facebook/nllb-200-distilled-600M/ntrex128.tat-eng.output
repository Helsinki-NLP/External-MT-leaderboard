Welsh A's worry that they may 'look like chickens'
Some AAs object to the proposal to change their name to MWP (UPA - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This assembly was created as a result of the intention to change its name to the Parliament of Wales.
The political spectrum of AI is concerned that this will lead to ridicule.
One Labour Labour Labour Party said it was concerned that its group "is rhythmically twp and Pwp".
For students outside Wales: twp  in Welsh means fool and pwp - fool.
The Scottish Labour Party group said it was "not a visa" and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "openness" to change the name, but noted that this was a short-lived move from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce changes to the name, stated: "The final decision on each description of how the members of the Assembly will be named, will of course be made by the members themselves".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the public talks on the proposals, which earned the Assembly a strong endorsement of the name of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the name of the AU, the Commission endorsed the Welsh Parliament members or WMP (UPA), but the MWP variant was widely supported in public discussions.
The AA has offered various alternatives, but the official who is fighting to reach an agreement, Elaine Jones, may have a headache, who is expected to propose a bill of amendments in a few weeks.
Other changes to the Assembly's working method will be introduced to the reform legislation, including the establishment of the rules governing the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
When debating a law on how to name it, the A.A. may put it to a final vote.
Macedonians participate in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The entire nation voted to settle a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long considered its northern neighbor's name a claim to its territory and has repeatedly declined offers to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Georgy Ivanov, has declared that he is against the name change plebiscite and will not participate in the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that changing the name is the price of EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin ' s Day was quiet as it was in the churches of the Harlem War
"Historically, the elders I spoke to said that there was a church everywhere", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is none".
He said that it was understandable that all of them were going to disappear.
"People are communicating differently now", he said.
"These are not the neighboring rooms that people frequent now".
As for churches, he worries that the proceeds from the sale of assets will not last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
He added that churches could be replaced with condominiums with apartment buildings and filled with people who did not support the neighboring shrines.
"The majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those who move into these condominiums will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by the white parish before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolis Society in 1870, and St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The first white Methodist parish moved in the 1930s.
The black parish that worships nearby gets the property rights to the building.
St. Martin's was arrested by a black parish led by John Howard Johnson, a priest who led a boycott of black merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, opposing the hiring or helping of black people.
The 1939 fire caused extensive damage to the building, but the prestigious Johnson Parish decided to rebuild the building and organized a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the furnace of the herdsmen".
In July, a specialist who played the carillon called it "a cultural treasure" and "an incomparable historical instrument".
University of Michigan scholar Tiffany N.J. also noted that she was the first black musician in the world to play the carillon of Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the large carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
The events at St. Martin's Church in the past few months have been a complex mix of architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
Riznica, a member of the parish's board of trustees, was concerned that the diocese would "transfer the expenses to the treasury", writing to the diocese in July, although the treasury did not engage in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was no clarity in the eparchy.
A 13-year-old boy is injured by a shark while being baptized in a lobster in California
Officials reported that a 13-year-old boy was attacked and wounded by a shark while bathing behind a lobster in California on Saturday.
The attack occurred near the coast of Encinitas, near the Bay of Biscay, before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego-based KSWB-TV that he had been baptizing with his friends for nearly half an hour on Saturday morning and that when he heard the boy cry out for help, he swam with the group to help him get out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was a joy to catch lobster, but then he realized that he was "crying, 'I've been bitten!'
I was bitten!'
And he came to the boy, and said, The field of his mouth is broken.
"I called out to everyone, 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition was very serious.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined to be a safe shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper body.
Officials have blocked access from the Ponto coast in Casablanca to the Swami coast in Esinitas for 48 hours for security and surveillance.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, and most are not considered threatened.
Sayensbury ' s plans to enter the UK jewelry market
Sainsbury's excelled at Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style decorating salons and ready-to-wear assistant-signers.
As the UK's £2.8 billion jewellery market continues to grow as sales of fashion clothing and homewares continue to decline, major jewellery salons will be tested and, if successful, more stores will be in the next year.
Investment in decoration began when supermarkets began to look for ways to fill shelves after they had made claims for televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury said they will double the size of their jewelry offering to 3,000 works, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The series from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with branded shelves similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched the Boutique makeup series, making most of its designs vegan and youth-friendly.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two stores in Sainsbury's, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, the second in Selley Oak later this year.
Online stores and local stores mean that people who switch to small-scale grocery shopping every day need to do more to attract people to supermarkets.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets would start to look like department stores as a network of supermarkets sought to counter Aldi and Lidl's discount stores by offering more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury Argos has set up retail outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced the Habitats series since it bought two networks two years ago, which they say has boosted sales of the products and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous effort to renovate the supermarket's decorations and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury had tried a joint venture with Boots in the 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how to share pharmacy revenue in supermarkets.
The new strategy came about after Sainsbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, Celesio, for £125 million three years ago.
It states that Lloyds will play a distinct role in adding a wide range of skin care brands to four stores, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look of our decorative salons to make the environment better for our customers.
We also invited our specially trained fellow workers who were willing to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location means we are a place of beauty that resists the old-fashioned shop style".
Peter Jones is "angry" after Holly Willoughby's £11 million deal.
Drakons Den TV host Holly Willoughby's 11-million deal, which focuses on her expansion with Mark and Spencer and Aitivi, shows Peter Jones "angry"
Willoughby really doesn't have time for the home goods and accessories brand.
The couple's business was compared to that of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old television host went to Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones to make the infuriating film "Dracons", whose profitable lifestyle brand at the last minute delighted her with her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said that Jones was "angry", the golden-colored TV girl admitted to her new contracts (up to 1.5 million) on Tuesday during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she had no other time for her homewear and accessories brand.
The business was similar to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and would double Willowby's 11 million dollar stake.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced his retirement on Instagram, Jones left Britain to make his way to one of his vacation homes.
The source said that the trolley was one of Holly's most needed items.
This will be a long-term future that he will lead for the next two decades.
All the people were amazed at his decision to leave.
No one could believe what had happened on the Sabbath, because it was already the beginning of the Sabbath.
Marlow's headquarters has a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the departure of the "today morning" host, considered one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the firm a million dollars because of huge investments, from candles to clothing and homewares.
, and this could mean the end of a long-lasting friendship.
Willowby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin Jones, and his wife, Tara Capp, were close friends for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined it as chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and own a 40 percent stake in the television company of Jones Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Anna McPartlin as ITV's host for the "I'm a Celebrity" post.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not discuss his business activities".
We had a hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media's criticism of what some considered "unresident" and his positive views of the North Korean leader.
Why was President Trump so determined?
Trump said in a humorous voice, "the news is moving".
"I did not give up".
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after welcoming Trump with his first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the talks on denuclearization have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean chief diplomat Lee Yen-ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see a "appropriate response" to North Korea's early arms moves from the US side.
Instead, he noted, U.S. sanctions continue to be pressurized.
Trump expressed his optimism in his speech.
"We have good relations with North Korea", he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
And now we have a wonderful relationship".
He noted that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - halting missile tests, helping to free the prisoners, and returning the bodies of American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach when he spoke to Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but it would be better to have about 200 people standing there than 10,000 people from the outside trying to get into this full arena", Trump said.
Indonesia: Tsunami and earthquake kill hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they no longer needed them.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok, the national disaster was not declared a necessary condition for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so this is a bit difficult", Mr. Sumbung said.
While they were gathering funds for Save the Children in Palau, they were still questioning whether foreign workers could work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Emergency Agency, told the House that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation to see if international institutions could contribute to the assistance forces.
Considering that Indonesia, which has experienced regular earthquakes, is not prepared for such an uproar from nature.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Archaeology, it is not uncommon on other coasts.
It was bad that there was no white alarm siren that was visible only on the alarm in the palace effect, which would probably reduce the number of deaths in practice.
In the best of times, traveling through the Indonesian islands can be challenging.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even more.
The ship is headed to the hospital in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's broken infrastructure, and he distributes the money to roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit will keep Mr. Joko's administration under control as he will have to run for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where a majority of Muslims have adopted a conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using masks, bows, arrows and other crude weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool is deep in the equaliser.
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the 89th minute of the Premier League at Stamford Bridge in London.
Starridge took a pass from Shakiri when his team was behind 1-0 on about 30 yards from the Chelsea gate.
He pulled the ball to his left before hitting a long pole.
And it went up to the top of the branch, and went up to the top right of the branch.
Finally, the ball jumper Kepa flew through Arrizabalaga and fell to the set.
"I tried to get into that position, get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible in front, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, and I touched it once, but I took it again because I thought too much about it".
The Belgian star of Chelsea went 1-0 after Eden Azar scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' striker gave up the material to Kovacic before going back and then down to the center of the field, and he fell to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick presentation in the field center.
And he put Hazard into the ark, and he threw the bullet at him, and he was punished.
Hazard passed the defense and went to Liverpool with his left foot, passing Allison Becker.
"Liverpool" will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the "San Paolo" stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet "VideoTone" in the UEFA Europa League on Friday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 on Saturday morning, the Ministry of Emergency Situations announced.
Many people were reported to have been affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and caused a wave of up to 20 feet, according to a press conference by the representative of the Sutopo agency, Purvo Negroho.
The city of Palú, home to more than 380,000 people, was devastated by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman.
The murder investigation began this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at Grayson-Muse on John Street at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.

The Parliamentary Monument of Cromwell was the last memorial hit of the "Recording of History" series
His expulsion would be poetic justice, as was the case with the Taliban, for destroying many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which were carried out by fanatical Puritan pursuers.
However, the Cromwell Society called Creek's proposal "childish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "When the current debate is about the elimination of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be the target.
There was no iconography of the English Civil War, nor was there a Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake would have been sacrificed for the actions of his grandfather Thomas a hundred years ago.
Mayor William Hameau Thornecroft's remarkable Cromwell performance was a 19th-century idea that many still consider to be famous, considered part of history.
Goldsmith told the Saturday Telegraph: "Cromwell was viewed more as a guardian of the Parliament than a monarchy at the end of the 19th century.
The question of whether this is a complete accurate performance is the subject of endless historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century not only marked the further development of our nation but it is certainly a one-sided characteristic of Cromwell.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and perpetuated".
A Chinese farmer is killed by a pig killer
According to local media, the farmer was frozen in southwestern China.
A man known only by the surname "Yuan" was found dead of a blood-stained artery at the Lupanshū pork market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A vaccine for pigs was prepared for introduction on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he and his brother, a native of neighboring Yunnan province, went to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door was open to the neighboring pigsty.
He said that he was the father of blood and pigs in the manger.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed the killing of a 550-pound pig farmer.
"My two brothers' legs bleed and disappeared", said the brother of two brothers named after the "U" family, called "Guyan's Evening News".
According to the surveillance camera, Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not related to Yuan or his half-brother.
The market manager reported to the evening news that the pig was kept under lock and key to prevent anyone from attacking another person while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The family and market authorities are reportedly in talks to compensate for her death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband's farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, 650 pounds of pork stuck a Welsh farmer in a tractor, until his wife threatened the animal.
In 2012, when pigs ate a farmer in Oregon, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood could be a trigger for them.

They're very interesting... they won't hurt you.
You should show them the respect they deserve".
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to move over cool waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the near future , the Rose will lead to a flood in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States .
At 5 a.m., the storm rose to a Category 1 storm of 85 mph, 385 miles southwest of the point of Euhenia, Mexico, at eastern time on Sunday.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to leave for the North.
At the same time, a sunset that moves eastward along the west coast of the United States begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, and when Rosa hits the lower California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will bring stronger tropical winds to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, up to 10 inches of rainfall are expected in some parts of Mexico.
Then the approaching tropical smoke and the jabulb will combine to create a large rainfall in the southwest in the near future.
Local 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, including garbage flows and desert sand.
Deep tropical smoke will bring rainfall rates closer to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the Southwest, especially much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches.
Sudden flooding can occur in conditions that are rapidly deteriorating due to the spread of tropical rain.
It would be very unwise to walk in the rain and walk in the trash.
Heavy rain can make the canyons empty rivers, while hail brings strong winds and raises dust.
The storm's approach will bring local heavy rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than half an inch may cause small flooding and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Some of the breakdowns in tropical rainfall are approaching Arizona on Sunday and early Monday, and rainfall will be even more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain on the Tuesday will spread to the four corners and will continue until Wednesday.
Temperatures have dropped sharply throughout the United States in October, as the Arctic is cooler, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to a sharp change in temperature over short periods of time.
A good example of a sharp change in temperature on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
Temperatures vary by 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines.
The summer heat, which will continue for the next few days, is expected to increase and expand its range.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast, with a widespread spread from the 1980s.
Tuesdays in New York City could be as high as 80 degrees , which is about 10 degrees above average .
Our long-term climate forecast has high hopes of rising temperatures above the average and eastern half of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have seen the Bretta Kavanaugh
On Thursday, Supreme Court nominee Bretta Kavanaugh and 1980s woman Christina Blazey Ford watched more than 20 million videos of women accused of sexual assault on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued and the broadcasters on Friday cut regular broadcasts for the final round of the deal, which was made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI, to conduct a weekly investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh estimated that he was 100 percent drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a school dinner.
Kavanaugh said that in his enthusiastic comments, he was 100 percent convinced that this was not the case.
It is expected to be viewed by more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company counts the average viewing rate of CBS, and ABC, NBC, and CNN, the channel's Fox News and MSNBC channels.
The numbers were not known for other networks at the same time, which included PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has some problems with the weight of people who are supervisors in offices.
If we look at this in the future, the audience size is the same as it is at a football game or an Oscar ceremony.
Nielsen said that the hosts of the Fox News channel, which approved Kavanaugh's appointment, ran all networks with a total audience of 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After listening, the interest was restored.
Flake played the lead role in this Friday drama.
After the Republican's office posted a petition to vote for Kavan, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, where protesters shouted, as he attempted to climb the elevator to hear the court committee.
While CNN was on the air, he lay down for a few minutes and kept his eyes down.
"I'm standing here with you", one woman said.
Do you think you are telling the truth about that country?
And the angels said: Thou hast many wives, and the multitude of them is weak.
Flake said that his office had applied and that he would have more to say at committee hearings before the elevator was closed.
The cable and radio broadcasting networks were to vote for the live broadcast in a few hours to put the court committee's candidacy to a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said the FBI would only do so if the charges against the candidate were filed next week.
Flake partially convinced her to talk to her friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
The election was a force of its own, as Kawano would not be supported unless the Republicans checked it out.
President Trump has launched an FBI search against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May blames critics for Brexit as a "political game"
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her intention to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of violating national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is visiting a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview, with him in the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticized his Checker's plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal was "totally meaningless" in the event Britain and each other collected Tariffs.
Father Wade Sims: Police arrested Deaton Simpson, who was suspected of a crime.
THE police arrested a 20-year-old basketball player in Lydda, suspected of shooting Wade Sims to death.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, reports the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's resistance, and police said Sims lost points during the battle.
Police found a mirror at the scene of the crime and said they had found Simpson's DNA there, according to the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson asked, police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
The lawyer reports that the foundation is set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a head injury.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Search Task Force, the state's Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their support in the investigation leading to their arrests.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked local law enforcement for their "conference and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6, 6-inch tall was raised in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LGA.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "empty" and "in a state of shock" after Wade's death.
"What are you always worried about?" said Wade.
A volcanic eruption in Mexico
Ashes from the Popocatepetal volcano reached the southern areas of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday and recorded 183 gas and dust spills in 24 hours.
The center witnessed a large noise and a huge push.
Social media images showed a car covering layer in neighboring cities like Hojimilco, Mexico.
Geophysicists detected the volcano's activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The clash between police and Catalan separatists was an annual vote on the eve of independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after Saturday's independence protests against the Omon, while thousands joined competitive demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote for a split.
The group of pro-separatists wearing masks that O'MON held back dropped their eggs and dropped them with flour paint, usually creating dust clouds in the streets crowded with tourists.
Later, when the police used their handcuffs to stop the fighting, attacks were also carried out.
For several hours, the independence activists, the crowd that shouted "no killing, no apology", and the protesting juniors shouted, "Hey Spain, you're alive".
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the region facing independence remain high after a year later, on October 1, Madrid was declared illegal, but a referendum marked by Catalan separatists remains high.
Voters mostly preferred independence, although attendance was low, while those opposed to the split largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region as a result of violent clashes.
In support of the national police, the groups of the Independence Party held a camp on Friday night to prevent the demonstration.
The demonstration continued, but he was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse, 68, who took part in the protest with the separatists' wife, said that Catalonia no longer hopes for independence.
Last year was one of the best times we've had.
I saw my parents crying because they could vote, but now we're confused".
Despite a narrow victory in the regional elections held in December last year, the independence-making Catalan parties have tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either being freely expelled or awaiting trial in the run-up to the referendum and future declaration of independence.
Joanne Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who wrote to the police on her phone to protest, told the police that the conflict had been spread by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful", she said.
On Saturday, Orioles Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have made an initial conclusion since the end of last year, announced that he will be meeting for the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to discuss democratic values and repression", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crash
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in London, England.
The incident occurred at 19:30 Eastern time on Friday in Ballinaurgard-Kresent.
According to Inspector Bob Lemmings, the damage was done to the gate of the building itself.
In a moment, a car was being hit by a stroller.
Menga Strike defeated Livingston Rangers 1-0
The first goal of the Mangy dollar to win the Livingston Gate
Upper Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibroks.
Gary Holt and Hibernian were in second place on the floor and hit Manga.
Gerrard's team went undefeated in the Premier League this season and faced the eight-point heart leaders the following Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapid team in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unbeaten series in the division to six games, and Holt's head coach had still had a taste of defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing hope against harsh visitors
Before the Holt team could get ahead, the Rangers had to be directly with the problem makers.
Scott Robinson was interrupted, but he focused his efforts on his goal, and then when Alan Litgow made his way forward, he sent his efforts to head over to meet Halcott through the gate.
The owners were pleased to have allowed the Rangers to disturb the guests on the reserved court.
And that was the ultimate goal.
The Rangers were eliminated, and Livingston opened the scoring, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining to form the captured Manga.
By this time, the Rangers had taken the ball, but his team had failed to defend it, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was quite calm.
And this continued for the second half, and, well, Alfredo Morelos was really forced to take it from Kelly now.
Scott Pittman's Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor turned down his legs, while Lithgow hit wide from the other set of Livingston.
Crosses were regularly brought to the Livingston area and kept being cleaned, while two applications for the penalty - Helket's call for Glenn Middleton and one handball - were rejected.
What is "phenomenal" in Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland presenter Alister Lamont at the Tony MacAroni Arena
The phenomenal productivity and the result for Livingston.
It was amazing to see that they continued to increase the number of herds of the upper trajectory.
When they returned to the top level, their playing style and personal lineup had changed almost since then, but the big achievement had to be attributed to Hotl, who had inspired the team with his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Helkett was very large, had a very well-organized defense, while Mengo kept Goldson Connor and Joe Worrell in a tight spot.
The Rangers were not very exciting.
As good as they were at Gerard's time, they no longer meet those standards.
They had no last ball - they only had one field goal - and it was like a dangerous call to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin, everyone smiled and the sky was bright blue.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring NATO-allied relations.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Köln to open a new and enormous mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police went to the Security Council to block a group of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters came close to see their Presidents.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - most of them Kurds - also denounced Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German government to welcome him into the country.
The duel reflects the hesitation of the protestor, with one German Turk as a hero and the other greeting him as a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: A bicycle rider dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred in Deptford, southeast of the city, near the intersection of Bessed Street and Evelyn Street at 10:15 a.m. eastern time.
Even though the driver stopped and the medical staff arrived at the scene, the man died instantly.
The accident occurred on Childers Street and he died a few months later, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The police in the capital said that they were working to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
The roads were now closed, buses were evacuated, and drivers were advised to leave the area.
Long Lartin Prison Six officers were injured in the accident
The prison authorities said that six male prison guards were wounded in riots in the prison.
The crash at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire continued at approximately 9:30 a.m. on Sunday.
To combat the disorder, eight prisoners, standing on one wing, are involved, with special "Tornado" officers being recruited.
Officers were treating minor injuries sustained at the scene.
According to a prison service official, a special training prison staff came to fight the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers were wounded.
We tolerate prison violence and understand that those convicted will be turned over to the police and may spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin held more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had been hospitalized after attacking a prisoner.
In October last year, the OMON was called to investigate the serious unrest that led to the pool ball attack.
Hurricane Rosa hit Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (Dry Areas prevail)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it is likely that early next week, the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa will pass through the southwest direction, causing a sudden flood threat.
The National Weather Service issued flash floodwaters for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah on Monday and Tuesday, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The rose is expected to pass over Phoenix in rain on Tuesday, Monday evening.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only "Ten Tropical Cyclones" have maintained a depression tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that struck the AZ at a distance of 40 km.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center reports rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, while the Mongol Roman area of Arizona has a rainfall of up to 6 inches.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including central Rocky Mountain and a large basin, may take 1 to 2 inches (two to four inches) along with other outlying areas.
For those less likely to experience flooding, rose fires can be very good, as the regions are very dry.
However, flooding is a serious problem, and some of these precipitation may be very beneficial, as the southwestern area suffers from drought.
According to U.S. data, drought monitoring, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona's population is in extreme drought, the second largest category", weather.com reported.
First, the path of the storm Rosa leads to the sea in Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the 85-mile-an-hour [85 km/h] storm in Rosa, Euhenia, Mexico, is 385 miles south of Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm's strength is diminished as the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean become hostile.
So it is expected to dry up in Mexico in the middle of the day or on a Monday evening in the force of a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall can cause severe flooding.
"From southern California to northwestern Sonora, rainfall is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, even 10 inches", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then north through Arizona as a tropical depression, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning and southern Utah in the evening.
"The main threat from the Rose or its remains is heavy rainfall in Southern California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains can cause sudden flooding and flooding, which can be life-threatening, and they can cause frostbite in the mountains.
Attack Midsomer Norton: Arrested for four attacks
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsomer-Norton in the Excelsior-Terrass district on Saturday at 04:00 Eastern time.
He was taken to a hospital, where he remained "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset Police, a 17-year-old, an 18-year-old man and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Redstock area in the night.
The officers asked anyone who could have any record of the incident from their cell phone to step forward.
Trump told Kavanaugh that he was "suffering from the wrath of the Democratic Party".
"Voting for the Kano judge is voting to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "in shock" at the Democratic Party's anger during the bidding process.
Kavanaugh gave instructions to Congress on Friday that Christina Blazey Ford strongly and emotionally denied the allegations of rape when she was a teenager.
Ford also gave instructions at the hearing to hear the charges against him.
The president said Saturday was the day "when the American people saw the extraordinary quality and courage of Kavanaugh".
"Voting for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is voting for the confirmation of a lawyer who is one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a public service honoree", he told a group of West Virginia supporters.
President Kavan mentioned the candidacy of the Republican candidate when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the people of the republic in the midterm elections.
 Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
I don't run, but I run really".
"That's why I'm fighting for the Big Candidates everywhere".
Trump confirmed that Democrats want to "stand up and fight back".
The first main procedural vote on Kano's candidacy in the Senate will take place no later than Friday, the senior aide of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake, tsunami, and death toll in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed, many of them killed by the massive beach earthquake and tsunami that devastated Sulawesi, Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Pala on Friday, when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave swept the coastline late into the night, killing many and wiping out everyone on their way.
After the tsunami, an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck.
"When the tsunami threatens to strike yesterday, people are still doing their jobs on the beach and they didn't run immediately, so they were victims", said Sotopo Purvo Negroho of Jakarta at a briefing.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it robbed cars, logs, houses, it drove everything to dry", said Nugroho and added that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
He said that some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
Airport images released by the Emergency Management Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, outdated and destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On the Sabbath, the people continued to push the city underground.
The earthquake affected 2.4 million people in the region.
The Indonesian Agency for Appraisal and Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times (two hundred times) more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, could have increased the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found in the trenches under the ruins of the destroyed buildings, 540 people were injured, 29 ((or nine) disappeared without a trace.
According to Nugroho, casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 mi) north of the Dongal district, which is closer to the EIP Center.
The talks did not provide any information from the Donga, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300 thousand people living there", the Red Cross said in the petition, adding that its volunteers and activists have entered the affected areas.
It is a tragedy, but it could have been much worse".
The agency was criticized for not reporting that the tsunami hit Pala on Saturday, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
The social media footage shows a person on the top floor of a building screaming downward about an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed, the building and the cars collapsed.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages, disconnecting the area around Pala, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people were still in need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was opened only for emergency services and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to be at the evacuation centers in Palud on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeded 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision staff arrived in Pala from Donggala, they hid in the brass covers in their office yard, and passed by the stage, Mr. Doseba said.
And they told me that they had seen many ruins of houses.
That's too bad.
Even when relief groups began dark movements to activate disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that they were not allowing foreign workers to go to the Palace for deep-sea assistance.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign personnel and financial support can only start arriving if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"This is just a provincial disaster", said Auliya Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"To the government's response, 'Oh, well, this is a national disaster,' we can appeal for international assistance, but there is no status yet".
When Friday night came the night after the earthquake, friends and relatives of the missing people hoped that miracles would take their loved ones to turn off the dark storylines of natural disasters.
On the Sabbath, the little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers release the woman who has been with her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team for paragliding, had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the fishermen at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, along with the Mandaga masters.
"As an adult in paraplanetism, I have my own emotional work", she said.
Mr. Gendon told the para-planer community that after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel spread, he sent messages via WhatsApp to participants of the Pala Festival of Beaches for several hours.
Instead of the blue toss, his messages were only questions.
"I think that means that the news is not gone", he said.
Thieves received $26,750 when they filled out the ATM at Newport, a dam.
The robberies stolen $26,750 from a banknote-fueling worker in Newport on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver unlocks the ATM and prepares to bring in more money, as if having fun, Dett wrote in a press release.
Before he can practice, the other man "escape from the back of the servant" and steals the bag of money that was set aside for delivery.
Witnesses said they saw several people in the scene, but the police did not say exactly how many were involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted about it: "Formally, I said Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change was accompanied by her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
The show's host said she replaced singer Ariana Grande, who was unable to leave "for emotional reasons".
In addition to the abbreviation for the modern professional name, West had earlier said that the word had religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible and it means 'you,'" West said, discussing the title of his album.
"So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only", simple "you" - our simple expression of good or bad, everything".
The album is just a reflection of people".
He is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his favourite names as Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator J.J. Zee also came in with or without the deffices and capital letters.
Mexico vows not to use military equipment against its citizens
The elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel López, has vowed never to use military force against his civilian population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the student bloodshed.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use military forces to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Plaza Square, killing 300 people as leftist student movements swept across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help young Mexicans open public universities and provide monthly scholarships to students.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are contributing to youths' involvement in criminal groups.
US to double its funding of AI
As China has become an over-active AI player, US investors and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple, say they should double the amount.
While there is no official strategy in general in various areas of the U.S. government, there are many comments when they make several applications about artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China announced last year its plan to become the No. 1 innovator in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget would be a good start, given that the rest of the world is far behind the US, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence", Lee said.
The next big achievement is doubling funding, and it will double the chances of getting a job in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book AI superpower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in China's most powerful company in AI.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest-paid American player in the hotel industry, and later became the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee acknowledged and asked the U.S. government for technological competitions such as the DARPA project, and asked when there would be a next project to help.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to secure government grants.
"China doesn't take our academic leaders, corporations do", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been collecting stars from the best universities to work with AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also strengthen the U.S. in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that green cards should be automatically presented to doctors of science in the Russian region", he said.
The Chinese State Council published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China is funding academic institutions by the National Science Foundation and other government agencies to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
The U.S. Department of Defense created a joint AI center that would include partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on AI.
And this month, DARPA announced $2 billion in investments in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSFGA, it currently invests $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that sought to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence was delayed for months.
The Macedonians considered in the referendum whether the name of the country should be changed.
The Macedonian people will consider whether to change the name "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, because it has blocked its applications to join the European Union and NATO due to the decade-long dispute with Greece.
The province of Macedonia, located in Greece, whose name is the name of its northern neighbor, confirms its claim to its territory and vetoes its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In June, the two governments signed a treaty based on the proposed new name, but national enemies have confirmed that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic people.
President Georgy Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voters' attendance would correspond to the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to come true.
The referendum ballot question was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU and agreeing to a deal with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that one of the countries emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia is the price to pay for accreditation to bodies such as the EU and NATO in Macedonia.
"I am here today to vote for the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said the 79-year-old Olga Georgievskaya Skopje.
Although the bill does not have mandatory legal force, the members of parliament will execute the results of the vote to decide it.
A two-thirds majority of the votes in parliament will be required to change the name.
The state election commission said that no reports of violations were received until one hour.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters casting their ballots.
"I am here to vote for our place in Europe, my children", said 62-year-old José Tanevskiy Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country to allow the country to join NATO and the EU.
In front of the Parliament building, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled the seats into the tents that were being boycotted by the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the door of the curtains", Kavadarov said.
"We are a small country, but we have a advantage.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of Eurasian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev noted that NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I think the majority of votes will be in their favor, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are speaking for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "yes" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday showed that voters in the referendum were between 30 percent and 43 percent - below the required agreement.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those surveyed said they would vote "yes".
To pass the referendum successfully, the turnout must be 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum failed, it would be the first serious political clash in the history of the Western government, which came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the entire defence of Brighton in search of a goal
Sergio Aguero and the friendly Sterling went on to defend Brighton on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England defeating Manchester City 2-0 to win the match.
In the 65th minute, Aguero showed this very interestingly.
The Argentine striker scored a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the series.
He was washed up among three of Brighton's guards until he was thrown into the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green robes.
He passed a guard before passing a few others on the Brighton field.
He then found Sterling and made a left pass.
The English forward Aguero used his right shoe to deliver the ball, and the Aguero used "Brighton" goalkeeper Matthew Ryan to hit his right foot into the right side of the set.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in the end", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We played 55, 60 minutes.
And that was exactly what happened.
We scored a goal in that moment".
But Sterling Sky gave the Blues the first lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball in the Brighton area.
He sent the ball through the left side to Leroy Sane.
Seine touched Sterling several times before taking him to a remote post.
Sky Blues moved the ball forward into the net, without going over the line.
He faced Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Nekkar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
King Scherzer wants to play.
When the Nationals were out of the playoff contention, there was little reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who was always a rival, hoped to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the result was a playoff for the Rockies, who were leading a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least the wild cards, defeating the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but still seeking to close out their first division title.
"Even if we play for nothing, at least we can get the rubber on its feet, where the atmosphere with the people of Denver and the other team will play at any high level I want, this year.
Why do I not want to be a part of it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they have expressed interest in getting Scherzer into this situation.
Scherzer, who would have been 34 years old, had been training in prison on Friday, and on Sunday he would be throwing on his regular break.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 starts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the president briefly recalled his case with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we do in November is at stake.
We are five weeks away from the most important decisions of our lives.
The biggest of these is that I don't compete, but I actually compete, so I fight for great things everywhere".
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group, and now you see it.
They are determined to use the necessary means to restore power, and you see the futility and filthiness.
Whoever they hurt or whoever they overthrew is not concerned. They want authority and authority, but we refuse to give it to them".
Democrats said they were on a mission to "resist and disrupt".
He called the Democrats "angry, mean, disgusting and lying", and said, "And you can see that in the last four days".
He addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat St. Dianna Feinstein, who received a strong vote from the audience.
"Have you remembered his answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, what.
No, oh, no, what I expected - that was really bad body language - was the worst body language I'd ever seen".
The ministry is no longer a universal church.
Intolerance of Those Who Speak Their Minds
When the activists of the Movementum in my local party voted to criticize me, it was unexpected.
Finally, I realized that the last time we were greeted as Labour MPs was because we were all telling what we were thinking.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the criticism movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues such as the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and ironically, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham Eastern Labour Conference on Friday said: "We want our meetings to be meaningful and productive".
That's what happened to the GC congregations on Friday nights in the eight years I was a local service deputy.
Sadly, today this is no longer the voice of many meetings, and the promise of "good, decent" politics, though indeed begun, has long been forgotten.
The fact that the Labour Party was not tolerating different views became as clear as day and each opinion was assessed by the party leadership.
It started when Jeremy was a leader, because I started to expect that my colleagues, who shared a similar political view - national security or the EU single market - would never turn around and have a different view.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - then there's a barrage of social media derision calling for the central government to be criticized, for voting to be rejected, and for not being a member of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the words I am told are political.
I am amazed at the skill and courage of my colleagues who have never been ashamed of being called sexist or racist every day.
One of the most depressing aspects of this political era was how the level of crime was normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer that big church, and with every "declaration of disbelief" or change in election rules, the party is dissolved.
For the past two years, I've been trying to keep my head down, keep my voice down, and then I'd say, "I'd be fine".
But that is not my policy.
Since I joined the Ministry 32 years ago as a school student, because of the indifference of the Thatcher administration, because of the collapse of my general classroom, I have sought to advocate for better public service for those most in need - whether as a local council or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
In East Nottingham, no one would be concerned about my political views or my disagreement with current leadership.
To those who are leading the movement on this day, I can say that when the country strikes for Brexit, it will hurt our farms, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the waste of time and effort, loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, my only message, not to the Nottingham Moment, is to my constituents, whether you are Labour or not, that I am proud to serve you and I promise that no electoral risk or political ambition will prevent me from working in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Nottingham East constituency
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unruly Air
While the last two attempts may have slightly distorted the exact result, there is no doubt that Ayr was credited with the remarkably exciting match in the Premier League Main Day match.
They're on the table now, the undefeated side of the tent.
In the end, it was their superior defense, their best chance, lifted the home side and coach Peter Murchi has every right to agree.
"We have tried our games so far, and we are not losing yet, so I should be happy", he said.
"They used their opportunities better than we did", said Robin Christy, of Melrose.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt was met with Frazier Climone and earned Ayr the lead, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was eliminated by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers and Jason Baggott captured the fleeing attempt.
Climone increased Air's advantage with a penalty and introduced the ball just before the break, then realised the single attempt and scored 17-5 for Air in the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's efforts, modified by Baggott, cut the road five points.
There was a long delay to the later stretch of Ruaried Knott's serious injuries, and he resumed, moving forward through the Stafford McDowall test, modified by Ayr Climax.
Blair McPherson, who was in charge of the Air Force, was a yellow card holder at the time, and Melrose again tested with an unchanged Bruce Colvin at the end of the high-pressure cycle.
But the owners return and then Struan Hutchinson takes a yellow card to keep Clima from the ball until the penalty line, with McPherson landing behind the advancing Air hammer.
The climate was changed, and after a resumption, Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's boxing type and sent Gregor Henry to the home side for a fifth test.
Now the game star is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
When it became clear that Still Game star Ford Kieran was appointed head of the licensed restaurant organization, he was probably ready to move into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, which he created and starred in alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series would be the last of the show and planned a life after Kirnan Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the incident, but a source in the Scottish Sun said Kirnan wanted to be involved in a "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's waters open up the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
The motto of the Titicate Sea to the Amazon is: "The sea is ours.
It is the duty to return it".
In the 19th century, in the landlocked Bolivia, the memories of a bloody water dispute that took place on the coast of Chile are still alive - as if they were about to swim again across the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations have probably reached their highest level in the last decade, as Bolivia awaits an international verdict on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a movement, a force of unity and peace and, of course, it is looking forward to the results", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilia.
The tribunal in The Hague will see the International Criminal Court's ruling on the big screens of the country, hoping that after decades of contentious negotiations, it will uphold Bolivia's claim that Chile should conduct negotiations on its sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - is heavily involved in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he swore in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that if it does, it will change little.
The United Nations member in the Netherlands said that Chile could not decide on its territory and would not determine the outcome of the talks.
The international verdict, which was handed down within six months of hearing the final evidence, shows that the case was "not complicated", said international law expert Paz Zarat of Chile.
Boland is far from moving Bolivia forward, and it may be taking it back for the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea is stolen with the current Bolivian government", said Zarat.
He proposed that Morales's warlike rhetoric should be left to the will of Chillini.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate someday, but then it will be very difficult to conduct the discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decisions were unusually swift.
He said that Monday would give Bolivia "an amazing opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "a chance to end 139 years of conflict for mutual benefit".
Calzadalia also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most famous presidents, used the maritime situation as a political backbone.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to enter the Pacific", he added.
"A decision is an opportunity to see if you need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless the US believes
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never be the first to disarm a nuclear weapon unless it could trust Washington.
Ri made a speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to deliver on its promises made at the summit of competing leaders in Singapore.
His comments come from the US, which appears to be on the brink of a North Korean resumption of nuclear diplomacy, which was rebuilt by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after a meeting with Kim Jong-un in Singapore three months ago.
Ri said the continued "torpedo dream" of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the Korean War's declaration would bring the North to its knees.
Washington refrained from agreeing to the Pyongyang Declaration, initially making no disarmament moves.
Both Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang is deeply skeptical about abandoning the arsenal, which the country believes is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show the final route of the big headgear to the High Street next to you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a very large headwear for the SS19 collection on the runway, which illuminated the style set during the Paris Fashion Week.
The most unimpressive hats took over Instagram in the summer, and these designers sent their eye-opening pieces to the catalog.
Valentino's distinctive feature was a wide-brimmed hat that resembled a cotton-like decoration that submerged the model's heads.
Other large-sized accessories had precious jewelry, charms, and even pineapple - but they weren't made to warm your heads.
Tom Brown also chose strange masks - and on Halloween.
Most colorful masks were made to look like Hannibal's lecturer.
One creature was a snorkel and a full-piece scoob that looked like a water-skipper, while the other was a melted ice pack.
If you keep on being a fashion show, you are happy.
Style observers suggest that large gates may lead to the high streets near you.
The two-legged straw hat, which is visible to everyone from the size of the hat to Emily Ratajkovsky, is a hot one for the heel of 'La Bombas'.
The very uninspiring cult behind the hat, which was spread on social media, sent another big innovation to the catwalk - a straw beach bag, as big as a costume model.
A distinctive piece in Jacques's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week is a purple yellow raffle bag cut with a raffle field and burned with a white leather straw.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect big boulevards and beachfront tiles to hit the main street next summer - because the designer has left such a good impression and it would be hard not to notice the demand for large-scale accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have demonstrated high academic results and continued with another impressive test result in 2018, all reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, as recommended by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for the future and for higher education, for their chosen profession, and for their position in the world.
As an educational field that can plan and implement a private school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and a popular subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you speak in a language that people understand, it goes to their heads.
If you speak to him in a language that will reach his heart".
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build trust and relationships with other people.
The results of this year's exams show that languages rank first among independent schools in the league tables.
68 percent of foreign language students have graduated from A .
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A in Chinese, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are teaching foreign languages, and that the future will certainly require important skills for children and young people.
Today, languages are used as a choice of lessons in independent school programs and other fields, to the same degree as STEM classes (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Labour and Crafts Commission found that 17% of job seekers were unable to fill their job vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasing to prepare young people for future careers.
With the promising job opportunities that languages require, these skills are essential in a globalizing world.
Whatever your career, whether you learn a second language, will be a lifelong advantage for you in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
In a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75% could not speak a foreign language, while French was the only two-digit percentage spoken, at 15 centres.
So it is important for today's children to invest in language education.
Having multiple languages, especially in the developing world, will make it easier for children to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will have different languages.
Some schools will focus on modern classical languages, while others will focus on languages considered most important for the UK in early 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will be multiple languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today's global industrial environment, there is no denying that languages are becoming vital to the future of the country, and that this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must truly be "a skill of international communication".
Independent schools will offer this choice, diversity and advantage to Scottish youth.
We must do it well.
John Edward , Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron for his Lakers debut in San Diego
The crowd of fans who wanted to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers was almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the exact number of minutes he played is not yet known.
"It's not going to be more than one and it's not going to be less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted about James playing in limited minutes.
Earlier this week, after practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' "six-game season schedule.
"It's not necessary to play seasonal games to prepare at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's time in the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting campaign rallies tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
The first of five rallies planned for next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi, is expected to be held in the United States.
As the vote to approve the Supreme Court vacancy has been postponed, Trump is expected to win the upcoming midterm elections, as the November vote could mean the Republicans lose control of Congress.
When is Trump's West Virginia rally today, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube below.
Trump will hear this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was nervous about the Senate confirmation, which was expected to take up to a week during the FBI investigation, over allegations of sexual misconduct.
But the main purpose of these rallies was to provide some kind of incentive to the Republicans who were affected by the November election.
So, according to President Trump's election campaign, the five rallies next week are "aimed at empowering volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", a Reuters reporter said.
"The administration of Congress is critical to its agenda and the president will travel to as many states as possible before the hectic election campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today's rally "may bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be lit up by Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will be in West Virginia for the second time this month, a state that scored more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is seeking to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is running for office.
"For Morrissey, the president should try to force him to run for office, which is not a good sign", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, a Reuters reporter.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows the stomach to keep hope alive
After the three-part session, the four houses on Saturday afternoon may have needed the Ryder Cup.
The power of spoken language is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where is the moment?
"They had six points, now they're four, so we're going a little bit faster", said Jordan Spit on the day trip.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead, in twelve games.
The Americans, Spit said, felt a little wind in their sails and had a lot to encourage them to, at least the uniform of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and boasted three-quarters of a point each.
Spit is deadly, from tea to green, and sets an example.
As his game continued, the festivities became even more crowded, he made an important hit to tie the fourth game, and then he and Thomas scored two of two.
His defeat in Game 15 was met with similar applause, but that's what the American team is trying to tell you.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your game", Spit said.
Each of these players is now gone.
18 holes to mark.
The only players to score more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup - Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Four out of four of Europe's strange but lovely couples can't do anything wrong.
And the two pairs that did not strike on the Sabbath were the Molliwoods, and they did not strike on the Sabbath, and on the Friday, and at the ninth hour of the morning.
This race, and their energy, should win both the cements that are being collected on Sunday, and they wouldn't be the most popular player to seal a potential European victory at sunset, like Le Golf National Fleetwood or Molinaire.
Better both in different holes at the same time.
It is still early to talk about European glory.
When Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson met Alex Noren, the four morning heroes did short works by Sergio Garcia.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning four-time champion, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
On Sunday, you will not be allowed to go out of the pit.
It's so fascinating to watch the game of Forball and Forsom up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team and had great success until the final day, but this four-day session also showed that some of the US team, especially the Stateside, had a stomach for questionable wrestling.
European Ryder Cup final day with a score of 10-6
After Saturday's forebol and forsom games, the European team, which took a 10-6 lead over the United States, will gain a serious lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's duo beat Tiger Woods, who had fought with two wins, by four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who sought to preserve the trophy won two years ago at Hazeltine, took the lead over the American team that lost the series 3-1 in the morning forebol games.
The United States had four more games of opposition, won two, but they failed to make the deficit.
Jim Furyk needed eight points from 12 games on Sunday to save the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, after sensational breaks, were nicknamed the "Mollywoods", only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Foursquare, they played remarkably well to beat Woods and American rookie Bryson DeShambo by an even sharper 5-1.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday with a strong offense, played splendidly at times, but he has now scored 29 goals in 19 games of the season, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was on vacation for the morning foreforeball games, joined his partner in the forefore games, Henick Stenson, and beat first- and third-place finishers Dustin Johnson and Brooks Gate 2-1.
Although it was a nice, windy day southwest of Paris, Europe had no choice.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They defeated Spaniards John2&1 Rahm and Jan Pulter in four groups and later defeated Pulter and Rory MacIlroy in four holes by 4 & 3.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned to the game four points short in a single-elimination bracket, although as a host it was enough for Furyk to play in a draw to save the trophy.
After two days of best results, the Sunday counterattack seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says it will not be able to disarm any unreliable side
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions would strengthen confidence in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not be able to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had accepted "good wishes" in the past year, including a promise to halt nuclear and missile tests, dismantle nuclear testing sites and not to proliferate nuclear weapons, nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the right response from the United States", he said.
Without confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot be unilaterally disarmed.
North Korea repeated its complaints that Washington was opposed to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, and that if it took a step, North Korea would be rewarded, but its statement did not seem to reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done before.
On June 12, in Singapore, Lee reiterated that Kim Jong-un had agreed to work on the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and Donald Trump cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the current US president and North Korean leader, who promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States initially declared that Pyongyang should abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for a relaxation of the international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States "presses and pushes through the sanctions to achieve its goals, and even" opposes the declaration of an end to war", said Lee.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees  The utopian dream of people who know nothing about our history.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust".
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, the US leader revealed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke of the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that if one of the parties to the denuclearization issue had been South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
However, the tone of Lee's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missiles were inevitably aimed at the US mainland after President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said more work was needed and that sanctions should continue until North Korea ended its denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no temporary delay: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Friday: "The implementation of the sanctions must continue strongly and unambiguously until the Security Council understands the full, final, confirmed denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of "gangster-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to demolish both its missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the measures he wanted to achieve were the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard have enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University put all of its undergraduates to sleep more to combat the growth of a culture of "night" learning made with caffeine.
Academic students at the world's top university often are rude about how they view themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Health Center, thought the course was the only one of its kind in the United States.
He encouraged the class to begin after discussing the effect of sleep deprivation on study.
'A young woman came to me and said, 'Why do you call me old now?'
He said that no one had ever told anyone about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains the basics of how good sleep helps students in reading and sports, as well as how to improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course because students experienced severe sleep deprivation over the course of a week.
The one-hour course includes interactive assignments.
One section has a full-room image where students step on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, the effects of caffeine and light, the lack of sleep in athletic performance, the importance of sleep patterns.
Participants were told that prolonged insomnia may increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive campus map with icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know that students will not change their behavior quickly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking, Professor Chesler added.
According to him, a culture of pride for not sleeping well is still present, with the constantly growing pressure on students and modern technologies suggesting that lack of sleep is an even more serious problem.
According to him, providing adequate quality sleep should be a student's hidden tool in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety to prevent even excessive weight gain, as lack of sleep moves the brain into a hunger mode, leaving students constantly hungry.
Raymond So, 19, is a California student of chemical and physical biology, helping Professor Chazler to create a course, and he was in one of his classes at Harvard last year.
He said he opened the course's eyes and encouraged it to expand to the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to require all graduates to pass a similar curriculum ahead of their entry into a competitive higher education institution.
Professor Chazler advised students to set an alarm when to sleep and when to wake up and to be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lights, which can cause your scadian rhythm to fall out of favor, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Men's goalkeeper Gerard takes the men
Rangers suffered another defeat in the guest game; Dolly Men's goal was the reason for Steven Gerrard's united national team's 1-0 defeat of Livingston.
Ibrox's side attempted to record their first victory on the road since a 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving the manager running out of eight points for Ladbrokes, the Premier League leaders the Hearts.
I was hit seven minutes into the half and the Rangers' excitement in that short period of time was never like a tie.
Although Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston moved up to third, trailing the Hibernate.
Furthermore, the Rangers could face new disappointments, as line-up judge Callum Spence had to treat a head injury after an object was thrown from behind his head.
Gerard made eight changes, which took Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, who also drove the Livi 11, scored a touchdown from Heart last week, and would be thrilled that his well-woven outfit always impressed his teammates.
The Rangers may have dominated the farm, but Livingston did more with the ball.
Menga's first ever dismissal was when Scott Pittman was sent to the gate by Allan McGregor, who was supposed to score in two minutes, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keegan Jacobs' deep penalty attack fell to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow was only able to attack the back of the net.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, there was more hope than belief in their play.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have taken the penalty in the 25th minute, specifically because he had been in a clash with Stephen Lawless, but the referee Stephen Thompson disagreed with the Colombian player's complaints.
In the first half, the Rangers attacked the goal only twice, but the head-to-head and slow-down hits of Lassa Culibali and Ovie Edgariya almost bothered former goalkeeper Liam Kelly of the Ibroks.
Although Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have disrupted the game, there is no denying that they did so by their own efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle the deep Jacob set.
When Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Arfield, Scott Robinson ignored him, as he was about to finish the game with a modestly marked Mengo.
Gerard worked during the break, he traded Cooley to Ryan Kent and the rifle was quickly influenced by the fact that it was located in Morelos, but the influential Kelly stepped over his line to the block.
Livingston, however, drew guests to the game they liked, and Lithgow and Halkett kept on scoring long balls.
The Holt side could have extended the lead in the final stage, but McGregor Litgau was good enough to turn Jacob down before he went wide out of the corner.
When Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton kicked the ball in the final penalty, he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson never saw the ball again.
German: inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now from our Sunday Morning almanac, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the ISE-CHAPE is still going on, that day would be the birth of physicist Johann Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which gave rise to the device later known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has been a staple of pop culture as a science foundation, as did the 1950 film The Coronado Bells, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who were unlike cowboy scientists:
The man asked, "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Counter, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these earrings, you can really hear the effect of radioactively glowing atoms from the minerals".
Evans: "You know, it's popular now!"
"Guns" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But there is an invention that bears his name.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill and kill malignant cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, modifying them in a laboratory
They then see the protein that is common to many cancers, and then they re-inject it.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in a variety of cancers.
A woman who received a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize foreign cells lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory to identify the HER2 protein that is common to many types of cancer, then re-injecting the cells into the cell.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", says Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, uterine, lung, and colorectal cancer", says Professor Berzofsky.
The technique of removing immune cells from patients and "leading" them to cancer cells was useful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kenny West, after a scene on SNL, wore his MAGA hat and sat down on Trump's Dietrich.
Well didn 't go well
Kenny West made a live performance in the studio on Saturday night, praising the U.S. President Donald Trump and his candidacy for the 2020 election.
After performing the third song of the night, called "Ghost Town", which was "Great Gateway to America", he fought the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people a lot, and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago".
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, where he reversed Brett Kavanaugh's orders in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sexual Assault charges against Hollywood star Christina Blazey Ford.
Although not broadcast, Western Rank videos were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock tried to mock the West.
He also complained to Western audiences that he had trouble on stage with his headgear.
"They made fun of me on stage.
They said, "Get out with that hat".
They have mocked me!
And then they say, "I'm in the bottom", he said, according to the Washington Post.
And West said, "Do you want to see where you go to the bottom of the water?" And he was wearing my superman cloak, because that meant that you couldn't show me what to do.
Try the love".
The audience mocked his comments twice, and, according to Variety, the cast members of SNL were embarrassed, and one person told the press, "The whole studio was silent".
A few days earlier, the rapper Mac Miller, who was the girlfriend of singer Ariana Grande, had died and West was invited to replace the singer.
The West surprised many, I love to sing, to dress like a bottle of Pierre.
"THANK YOU to one of the most courageous spirits: THE MOBDY".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who she is and it's amazing".
"I just didn't want to give away to anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their culture) who, I think, accepts and produces an ideology that is harmful to the public.
He is free.
We are likewise . . . "
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he would change his name and is now known by his official name Kanyé West".
He was not the first artist to change their name and follow Diddie, who is also known as Puff Diddie, Puffy and P. Diddie.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, takes the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the young musical legend Prince also changed his name first to a symbol, then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of stabbing at Bel Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man died in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
This was in Balkhakor, the police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast civil court on Monday.
The charges will be prosecuted by the Prosecutor's Office.
The star of Game of Thrones , Keith Harington , enters into a toxic marriage
Keith Harington is best known for his role as Sword Swinging, a character in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles on screen often imply that young men must be strict to make themselves respectable and hit the Hero-macho stereotype.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Culture, Keith "thought something went wrong" and asked how to address the problem of toxic courage in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt very strongly about solving the problem.
'I feel so strong right now,' she said, 'where did I go wrong with my marriage?'
'What have we taught men as we grow older about the problem we see now?'
Whale television believes that her male characters may be partly responsible for the growth of a poisonous male.
He continued: 'What is it that is born and what is it that is taught?
Do young boys feel that what is taught on television and in the streets is the right thing to do for men?
I think that this is really one of the most important questions of our time - how can we change it?
Because something was wrong with the young men.'
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be making any prequels or performances of Game of Thrones, saying that the series was "made with battlefields and horses" at the end of the following summer.
Starting in November, Keith will star in the remade film "The True West" by Sam Shepard, about a film producer and his adoptive brother.
The actor recently stated that he considered meeting his wife Rose to be the best way out of the "Game of Thrones".
"I met my wife on the show, and from that moment on, the show gave me the opportunity to build my future family and my life", he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Rose, Ygritte played the love interest of Keith's character John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the basis of the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, healthcare workers.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases have been spread through sex, reflecting a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions through parts of China.
But that means the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people in a year.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry women.
Most of the diseases are caused by a lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatments.
Maxine Water denies the information of GOP senators, blasting "terrible lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US Senator Maxine Waters (Plaintiff) denied on Saturday that one of her employees had posted the personal data of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the Legislature
Los Angeles Democrats confirmed that the claims were pedaling with "ult-right" pandigms and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Su tweeted.
The data released includes home addresses and phone numbers for the U.S. Sensors. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both in Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Three senators came out after questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative party groups such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that provided the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and that they published information about Waters' employee, reports the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false", Su continued.
"My staff member  whose personal information and security have been compromised by these threats and allegations - is not responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and utterly false".
Su's remarks quickly attracted online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Flischer.
"This is a denial of anger", wrote Flicher.
"It shows that he does not want to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, let him not be angry.
They do not have to be rude.
They should not question the accuser's motives.
They must be peaceful and quiet".
Waters' reaction was similar to what Fleischer compared to the Democrats' criticism of the Kavanaugh judge at the hearing on Friday, which was also very angry.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate, also expressed his views on Twitter about the issue of Water in the midterm elections.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Father said his office "warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false demands.
We will ensure the detection of criminals, - he continued, - and they should be held legally responsible for threatening and destructive actions against our employees.

Now, it's become a habit to look for the significance of Brexit in any new British film, and this probably applies to the action of Johnny English, which originated as Johnny English in 2003 and was revived as Johnny English Reborn in 2011, the humorous franchise .
Can we satirize ourselves about the country's new export potential?
The uncompetent, pop-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny has a license to update English stuff a second time - his signaling name, his comic book creation, non-English speaking movie theater areas.
He is, of course, a secret agent who, despite his bizarre appearances in the show's glamour, has received a little Clouseau, a part in which Mr. Bean and the puppets of that department put a record on the Fire Chariots, the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is based on Atkinson, a traveller and international mystic who once, and now, played a forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are a couple of beautiful moments in this last JE performance.
John I loved Johnny's English in the short time he was approaching the helicopter, wearing medieval weapons and his rotor plates pressed against his helmet.
Atkinson's skill at playing physical comedy is apparent, but on the surface, it seems rather poor and odd, because "superhero" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible" now offer reliable comedy ingredients themselves.
Johnny English's humor is not as inventive as Atkinson's Bean-style jokes, as humor is not for adults but for children.
The current situation for many years is that Britain is a serious problem.
The cyber-hacker breaks into the British secret spy web, surprising the searcher and revealing the identities of all British agents - unfortunately, Kevin Eldon plays a minor role.
This is the final salute to the Prime Minister, who is an incredibly popular person, who is already experiencing the full meltdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Threshold-May character, but there is nothing to do with the script.
His intelligence advisers suggested that he would have to remove someone from his job because the existing spies were compromised.
And this means that Johnny is humiliating himself in English, and he's been a school principal at some institutions now, but he's been giving record lessons on how to be secretly operative: great stuff here, because English Rock School offers you a spy academy.
English is returned to Whitehall for an urgent briefing and they meet again with the former patient sidewalk driver, Boog, played by Ben Miller.
Boff is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, and it's like Vicka Pepperdine was a little wasted playing the fun-and-the-good-ass hockey player.
So, after seeing the secret service of his greatness more mistakenly, Batman and Robin reconnect with the beautiful and dangerous Ophelia Puleva, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is threatened by a charismatic tech billionaire who believes that Britain can solve computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Boff begin an odyssey of Persian high-jinns: dressed as waiters, they burn down a luxurious French restaurant; they create a smuggling riot on the luxurious Volta yacht; and English, using virtual reality headgear to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volta house, create pure anarchy.
The latest tracks, of course, don't say much, but as friendly and noisy as they are, they attract a lot of kids to television.
It's really nice stuff.
After thinking about Johnny English's other films, I wondered: Could the British film industry really not give Rowan Atkinson a role that was worthy of his talent?
The service refused to build a four-day work plan for the British, but was paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is faced with a radical plan to make it possible for British workers to work four days a week and get five days' wages.
The party wants the company's heads to give workers extra wages for the money they have accumulated through the AI revolution.
And they shall see the work of the workers three days' rest, and take their wages to their houses.
According to sources, the idea "will come directly into the party's economic program and plans to engage the country in workers' movements".
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to allow workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source reported: 'Political surveillance is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
'It won't be overnight, but the four-day workweek is the party's vision to balance the economy in the workers' interest, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party will not support such an idea, and the Green Party has pledged to support a four-day workweek in the 2017 election campaign.
The current trend is not generally supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
The Chancellor of Seoul, John MacDonnell, used the Labour Conference of last week to define his position on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnell said that he was determined to prevent the government from "directing" and "professionally" public utilities.
According to the plans of the Chancellor of Seoul, the shareholders of current water companies will not be able to fully recover their shares, as the Labour government may hold back the money for deliberate violations.
He also approved plans to create Inclusive Property Funds to place workers on company boards and transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to employees with annual dividend pockets of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, say "60 Minutes", and the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation can change their minds.
FBI investigations into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the vote to nominate his candidacy to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of how the bureau's results might influence the decisions of Republican senators.
On Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelly asked the Republican Senate whether John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham could reveal anything that would change the FBI's mind.
Kennedy was more visible than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
"I told him to go to the hearing, and I told him I had spoken to the judge in Kavanaugh.
And then I called him, and he was accused, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, and unyielding".
Graham's voice seems to have been cast into stone.
"My idea is about Brett Kavanaugh and he demands a dynamite charge", she said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know this: Brett denies it", Graham Christine added, referring to Blassey Ford.
"but no one who called him could confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the Global Citizens' Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event featuring a host of influential stars with an influential mission: to fight global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 is not to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but to learn about the event.
The Global Citizens Festival, announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of active combatants.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers would volunteer, email, phone, or inform the world leader of their anti-poverty agenda.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal in 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to attend an event, or is it another case of "clictivism" where people seem to make real changes by signing up, sending an online message or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has written more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters, pushing for a variety of goals.
It said that as a result of these actions, world leaders announced policies to take on $37 billion worth of commitments that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 outstanding commitments and applications, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or attracted.
The group estimates that the funds provided have directly affected 649 million people worldwide today.
Among its key commitments, "Helping Children to Reach Their Full Potential", the UK-based The Power of Nutrition has pledged $35 million to Rwanda, with more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens to stop the feeding of children in the region.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make history by reminding the social injustice of food", said food ambassador Tracy Ullman directly to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 measures were adopted in the UK to encourage improvements in maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the "Food Power" project, which will impact 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the questions on their website, "Do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens responded, "It's going to be a long and complicated road - sometimes we'll fall.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that are ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Mona-Deborroy are some of the artists who will perform at the event, which will be hosted by Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman and will take place in New York.
US Navy could block Russian energy exports for "blockade" - Interior Secretary
Washington could turn to its navy "when necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
According to Zinka, Russia's involvement in Syria is a reason to explore new energy markets, especially where it works at the legitimate call of the Government.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to control energy in Eastern Europe, just like they do in the southern heart of Europe", he said.
And the official said that there are ways and possibilities to resolve this.
The United States has the ability to block our sea lanes with our Navy and, if necessary, block their energy sources from being put on the market, ", he said.
Zinkke addressed the participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance (the Energy Consumers Union - a nonprofit group that calls itself the voice of US energy consumers).
He compared Washington's relationship with Iran and Russia, pointing out that they are actually one.
"The economic option towards Iran and Russia is essentially to put pressure on and to reduce energy resources", he said, stressing that the Russian economy is entirely dependent on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration's stated mission is to sell liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russian gas, which is much cheaper for Europe.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to reject the project of the North Stream 2 pipeline without delay - a project that Trump believes makes Berlin a Moscow target.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream-2 pipeline is merely an economic project designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin views Washington's fierce opposition to the project as purely economic and as an example of unfair competition.
I hope we can agree on the fact that energy sources cannot be a tool of pressure and consumers have the right to choose their suppliers, - said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction in Germany, which (Germany) reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization - the Federal Union of German Industry (BDI) - urged the US to stay out of the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of German Industry (BDI), said: "The involvement of foreign governments in our energy supply issues creates big problems".
Elizabeth Warren is considering running for president in 2020", says Massachusetts senator
After the midterm elections, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she was running for president.
At the Town Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his candidacy for president.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our failed government, including a woman as leader", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will begin to prepare for the presidential election".
In the meeting, Warren expressed his opinion about Donald Trump, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy", he said.
Warren Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, were openly critical.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "We need an FBI investigation before we can vote".
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that Warren felt that most of his constituents did not believe he should run in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "likely" voters said that a senator should not run for office.
Thirty-two percent supported the election.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick had a stronger support: 38 percent supported his candidacy, 48 percent opposed.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed the potential of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 primary.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make his decision official by January.
At a presidential rally , Sarah Palin recalled that Track Palin had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence
At a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he said: "I think other families who have suffered from the effects of the post-traumatic stress disorder and other injuries that our soldiers carry with them will understand what my son has been through, what he has been through since he came back",
Palin called his son's arrest a difficult topic and said about his son and other war veterans: "They are changing and coming back as vengeful, They want to know if they, their comrades who served on earth and in heaven, and every other person who served in the military, will be treated as they have treated their country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Waasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Waasilla, Alaska on Monday, charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia oppose the new policy of asylum
18 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against a new policy that prohibits providing shelter to people fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington submitted a consultative analytical paper to the court in support of the refugee asylum option, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions (Sessions v. Grace), a lawsuit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She reports being mocked by her co-worker and the sons of some of the gang members, but on July 20, U.S. officials reject her request for asylum.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers in the United States who assist Greece say that many asylum seekers from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala are coming to the United States because of the high rates of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has repealed a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeals for Immigration Affairs that allowed undocumented immigrants who were fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, said Friday: "The new policy is ignoring dozens of state, federal, and international laws".
Under federal law, decisions on asylum claims must be based on specific facts and circumstances in the application, and such a ban violates this principle, - says the advisory analytical document submitted to the court.
In a consultative analytical paper, lawyers reported that adopting a policy of denial of immigrants negatively impacts the U.S. economy, has a high potential for entrepreneurship and can provide "needy jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
In a speech on the new policy on June 11, Sessions said: "Settlement will be given to those who leave their home countries because of race, religion, national identity or membership of a particular social group or political views, or persecution or fear".
Providing shelter is not the way to alleviate all the problems - even serious ones - that people face around the world every day.
As the death toll doubles, desperate rescue efforts to find survivors in Palo
The more the fate lasts, the more perilous it is for the survivors.
"Things are very tense", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforts a baby who is wearing jewelry in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palo.
Every minute, an ambulance carries dead bodies.
There is no clean water.
People are seen returning to their ruined homes, searching through their sunken property and trying to preserve their possessions as long as they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were buried.
Due to ongoing earthquakes, some of the injured, including Duie Harris, who broke his back and shoulder, are lying outside the hospital due to street treatment at the Army Hospital in the city of Palo.
When the earthquake struck, he and his wife and daughter were in a hotel room on the fifth floor, and his tears filled his eyes.
"We didn't have time to escape.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, telling the couple that they were in the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife's cry for help, and then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are well".
US ambassador accuses China of mocking China with propaganda
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US newspaper about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
After the US accused China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid app for China Daily in Iowa's best-selling Des Moines Register newspaper - China denies the accusation.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation of Beijing interfering in the U.S. election was a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to pressure China.
It is common for foreign states to place advertising to improve trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently unable to escape the escalation of the trade war, which is reflected in increasing the level of tariffs on each other's imports.
Tariffs imposed by China at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa, which Trump backed the Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
The US ambassador to China, Terry Brenstein, longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China has now increased the ridicule by spreading propaganda in our free media,  says Brenssted Des Moines Register in a Sunday issue.
To spread propaganda, the Chinese government has used free speech and media, a sacred American tradition, to place paid advertising on the Des Moines Register, Brenssted writes.
Unlike the US, where the media is heavily controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, you will find very few dissenters here - in the newspaper kiosks on the streets of Beijing - and you will not see the true reflection of the changing views of the Chinese people about China's troubled economic trajectory, he writes.
One of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish my article, he added, although he did not say which newspaper.
Analysts warn that due to the decline in the status of Kawano, women voters fell in love with Republicans before the midterm elections
Despite repeated sexual assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, most leading Republicans are in favor of him, and a sharp negative reaction is expected during the upcoming midterm elections, especially by women, analysts warn.
Although the emotions surrounding the vote were bitter, most Republicans had already registered to vote.
In an article in The Hill published Saturday, Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said: "These things are irreversible".
I'm not sure if Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s call for a last-minute FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters, says Richer.
Women aren't going to forget what happened last night - they won't forget it tomorrow or November, says Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, as reported by the Washington Post on Friday.
According to Mic, the Republicans, who had a majority in the Judiciary Committee, shouted early Friday that "November is here!" when they decided to continue to nominate Kavanaugh despite the instructions of Dr. Christina Blaze Ford.
Nonpartisan political analyst Stuart Rotenberg told the news website: "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are about to be higher than expected".
People say it's still high, and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban female voters who have yet to decide who to vote for and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who do not vote at all if they do not have a president they like.
Even before Ford gave more detailed public testimony accusing the Supreme Court candidate of sexual assault, analysts speculated that a sharp negative reaction could occur if Republicans confirmed the candidate.
"This was a mess for the Big Old Party (GOP, the unofficial name of the Republican Party)," said former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele, writing to NBC News earlier this week.
Guy Cecil, leader of the group Priorities USA, which helps elect Democrats, told the news channel: "This is not just about the committee voting or the final vote or Kavanaugh joining the court, it's also about how Republicans do it and how they deal with Ford".
However, following the Ford and Kavanaugh guidelines, Americans were divided over who to trust - with a slightly larger following.
A recent YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents said they believed or believed in Ford's guidance, while 35 percent said they believed or believed in Kavanaugh's guidance.
In addition, while 38 percent of Kavanaugh's respondents said that he lied or may have lied when giving instructions, only 30 percent said so of Ford.
Following Flake's summons, the FBI is currently investigating charges from Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford swore an oath that Kavanaugh was 17 when he was drunk and assaulted.
Ramirez accuses Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of showing him his genitals at a party while he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to include Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, launched his new company, which aims to beat Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrapt is the final project of the legendary man, a firm that is being built by Berners-Lee on an open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which data can be viewed by which person.
In a personal interview with Fast Company, Burns-Lee Inraptt claimed that the company's goal was to "dominate the world".
We have to do it now, he said, about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app allows people to create their own personal online store using Solid technology.
It may include personal lists, work schedules, calendars, music, and other personal and professional instruments.
This is similar to using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify in the same browser and at the same time.
The most important thing is that who can see what information depends on the user.
The company calls this improving personal opportunities through information.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrapt needs to attract a variety of resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lidan, a security platform called Bruce, acquired by IBM, a number of people hired to work on the project, and a community of freelance programmers.
Starting this week, programmers from around the world can build their own apps using tools installed on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his company don't even talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a change, because all of their business models have a time limit of one hour to change completely.
We do not ask permission from them.
In a report published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrapt's mission: "The integrity and stability of the new network built in Solid is to support the ecosystem".
In 1994, Berners-Lee was able to transform the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee made his point in the debate over net neutrality.
Even when he launched Incrust, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Foundation Institute.
I remain very optimistic about the future of the Internet   said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A military award for World War I  A memorial to the Victorian priest
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I was commemorated in his hometown 100 years after his death.
On September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the award for the Belang English and Leocore raids.
But four days later, the sniper shot him dead, and he was unaware that he had received Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday, at a parade in Northamptonshire, two of her grandchildren unveiled a monument to her.
According to one of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, "This is a remarkable symbolic moment, a stone that will be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic actions".
According to the London Times, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through a thick fog and under heavy enemy fire from the St. Canton Canal.
And he went forth with great courage, and threw himself under the fire of the enemy, and with the weapons of the field he smote three men of the enemy, one by one.
A German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Van on 4 October 1918  a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said of his grandfather, "I could never achieve such courage, he was so modest".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann laid flowers on the stone after the parade, which was played by the Brentwood Empire Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann was delighted and honored to be part of the parade and said that the true hero's courage is felt through the respect shown by the people.
MMA fans went out all night to watch the Bellator 206 fight, but instead of fighting, they showed them Peppa Pig
Imagine you're up all night watching the most exciting part of Bellator 206, but you're not showing it anyway.
A total of 13 meetings were announced, six of which were in the main ring. These were broadcast live overnight on UK Channel 5.
At 6am, just before the show, Gerard Mussey and Rory McDonald were in front of the British audience, and the Peppa Pig appeared on the screens.
Some were discouraged, and they waited until the very early hours of the morning to see the battle.
One fan tweeted that the replacement of wrestling with a children's cartoon was called "a bad joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications, said: "The government's decision at 6 a.m. that the content was not compatible, so I had to switch to a children's program".
Peace pigs, that's what.
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said they plan to change their approach to keep British audiences out of the way in the future.
I think this problem will be solved when I think about repeating this struggle", said Cocker.
But today is Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we cannot decide this matter until Sunday, and their time until Monday.
Yet, we are working on it.
And you can trust me, when they switched the show, we wrote to them very hard, even in very unkind words.
We tried to solve this problem, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't a technical error, it was a state-sponsored issue.
I promise that this will never happen again.
We're going to cut it down to five as usual, from six meetings, and we're going to increase the number of fans, but we're wrong.
This is a tragic event.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt very low about himself because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that when he was younger, he felt very inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the strength to succeed.
At 24, when he was in high school, he didn't realize that everyone was different from me.
Speaking on Desert Island Discs, a radio 4 program hosted by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about gay rights with the intention of giving hope to others.
Being a father also kept him from thinking about winning the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
After appearing as a rejected character on Laverne, Daley said she felt very low compared to others because "love of boys and girls in this society was a different thing".
She said, "To this day, feeling different has been what has given me the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was different, and he feared that others would reject him when they found out that he was.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active LGBT member and used her attendance at this year's Australian Games to openly promote homosexuality in more countries.
She was glad to be able to speak directly about it and said that she did so to give hope to others.
According to a three-time world champion, she was surprised to learn that the man she met in 2013 was in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Last year, she said that she married an Oscar-winning actor who was 20 years older than her, but their age difference was never noticed.
You go through a lot of hardships as a young man  At the age of 14, he participated in his first Olympics, and three years later his father died of cancer He said that it was hard to cope with these things.
In June, the couple had a child, and they named their son Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said that his whole life changed.
"A year ago, all I thought about was winning the gold medal".
There is in the world something more valuable than a gold medal.
My gold medal is Robbie.
He named his son Robert after his father, who died of a brain tumor in 2011 at the age of 40.
According to Daly, her father refused to accept her death and one of her last requests was a ticket to London for 2012, where her father wanted to sit in the front row.
I could not say to him, 'Father, you can't be in the front row with us anymore.'
And I took hold of his hands, and he ceased to breathe; and I saw that he was dead, and he also was healed.
In 2012, Daley competed in the Olympics and won bronze.
"I've always wanted to jump in the water in front of people I know at the Olympics, and it's a never-before-seen feeling", she said.
This inspired her to choose Heather Small's song for the Olympics, which still excites her.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 London time.
Mickelson , who was out of shape , was in the reserve pool Saturday at the Ryder Cup
In the 47th game of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, US representative Phil Mickelson will set a new record, but he must keep himself in good shape to avoid this unfortunate moment.
Mickelson is entering his 12th Biennale, setting a record, and captain Jim Furyk sends him to the reserves for Saturday's game.
Instead of being the center of events, the five-time winner spends his day either as an organizer or working to correct those who dislike his game.
The narrow field of Le Golf National is a bit more difficult for a 48-year-old who couldn't hit very straight even at the peak of his career, because he doesn't make mistakes on the field.
Although the course itself was not very difficult, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson met British champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start well in 12 singles, Mickelson's game could be a very decisive one.
Furic expressed his hope to his man, though he could not say anything else.
"He knows his situation very well today, and he hugged me and showed me that he's ready for tomorrow".
He is very confident.
He still knows everything, he's been teaching his skills to the teams before and last week.
I never imagined that he would play two games.
I had imagined more, but that's exactly what happened, and that's exactly what was going to happen.
She wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will break the Nika Faldó record for the number of Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This may mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched his personal record.
With Mickelson having 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties to his day, Furyk said his presence was beneficial to the team.
He's funny, smart, funny, and he's great to be on the team", she explained.
I think it was interesting to see that the young players also had a good time playing with him this week.
You learn more with it than you do with a game.
European national team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great progress may soon be made
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European national team, knows from experience that playing a lot better than others on the final day of the Ryder Cup alone can quickly become an uncomfortable position.
The Danish athlete made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderram, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the American players, but they quickly finished behind and won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remind yourself that you had a big advantage at Walderram and Brooklyn; but in Brooklyn we lost, and at Walderram we just won", said Bjorn, looking at the 2018 team's games: Le Golf National also took a 10-6 lead on Friday and yesterday with a 5-3 lead.
It is not the end yet, and we will all see it.
Tomorrow will not be interesting.
Go out and do everything right.
There is still hope as long as honey is written.
We have a plan, we want to take that trophy away, and that's all we have to think about right now.
I told you, we have 12 players and we also have the best players in the world against us.
Admiring how his players perform on the golf course, Björn added: "I'll never be ahead of the game.
Tomorrow is another game.
Tomorrow is personal games and they're a whole different thing.
It's good to stand there with your partner when things are going well, but it's good to be a good golfer when you're alone.
Tell the players this story. Tomorrow is the day you show off your skills.
Now you are divorcing your partner, and they must show their skills.
Unlike Björn, who is opposed by Jim Furyk, he encourages his players to show more skill in the individual game, not only by Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was in a variety of situations, one time he was part of the team that won in Brooklyn, but the result was a miracle.
I remember every word captain Ben Crenshaw said to his players on his last day in 1999.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start them fast, like in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the season starts, he puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We've got our players out as we need them, and tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle.
Thomas was to lead the game and face Rory McIlroy in the high-stakes game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Poulter were to face him in other games.
"I chose these guys in such a way that I thought that order covered the whole road", Björn said of his choice.
The new German ship was delayed for another year
The new German naval frigate is scheduled to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War war warships, but it will not reach it until next year due to poor systems and rapidly rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the all-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit (Zam) with reference to a military representative.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but concerns raised after its delivery changed the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the naval forces in 2007, will replace the older Bramen-class frigates.
The ships will be equipped with a complex of powerful balls, anti-ship and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stels-technologies such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer service life: new frigates should be able to operate for up to two years in remote ports.
However, the leading warships are becoming obsolete because of the constant delays in their deployment to a foreign country, notes Die Zeit (The Times).
The F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blemm und Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time a ship that had not been used by the navy had been returned to its builder.
Little was known about the ship's return, but German mass media reported on program and hardware defects on board, meaning that the ship was useless in military duties.
The program was particularly important for the lack of adequate ship supplies, as the crew of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships was about 120, which is only half the workforce of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, the ship's overweight limits the possibility of adding future naval upgrades.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Pfalz was considered to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to non-structural equipment, the cost of the project, including training the crew, is becoming a major problem.
The initial value of the project is estimated at € 3.1 billion ($ 3.6 billion), compared with € 2.2 billion .
The problems associated with the new frigates are particularly important in recent times, as there have been recent reports that Germany is reducing its naval strength.
Earlier, Hans-Peters Barthels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually reducing the number of ships.
And the matter grew more serious, as the captain had said; for the old ships were taken away, and the new ones were not brought into service.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret lives of flying mice
A new study is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands, which aims to discover how flying mice use the landscape during hunting.
The results are expected to help study the behavior of unique mammals and also contribute to conservation efforts.
The study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will involve simple and soprano-pipipiestres, as well as long-eared and bulbous broad-headed mice in the Inverereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed to monitor the activity of mice flying in the main areas around the hotel throughout the season.
Employees and volunteers at the National Health Service (NHS) will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound analysis of all records will help to determine the frequency of the cries of the mice and what types of mice are doing.
Then a detailed landscape map and report of their behavior will be prepared.
According to Rob Dwyer, a conservation advisor at the National Wildlife Service (NTS), the results will hopefully show what areas are important to flying mice and how they can be applied to each species.
This information will help us to identify ways to better protect forest ranges for the construction of hedges and other flying mice and related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the number of flying mice has declined dramatically over the past hundred years.
The construction work is threatening the lives of rats and is threatening the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, liposuction of building materials and some chemical processing, as well as attacks by house cats  all pose a threat to mice.
Flying rats are not actually blind.
However, their nighttime hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles along their paths.
The NTS, which oversees 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes flying mice very seriously.
Ten specialists are on duty to conduct regular inspections, examining mice and sometimes rescuing them.
The organization even created the first and only special flying rat ban in the Scottish counties of Trive and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten rat species live.
David Thompson, the manager of the hotel, said that the hotel was the ideal area for them.
"There is plenty of room for them here in Trivia".
We have old buildings, many old trees and good living conditions for rats.
However, since little is known about the flying mice, our work here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow.
He stresses the importance of testing flying mice before conducting technical work, since the involuntary destruction of one habitat could kill up to 400 mice.
Flying mice are protected by law, prohibited from killing, torturing, or harassing.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer with the Flying Rat Protection Foundation, called on the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about rats, we don't know how their populations live yet".
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and lawyers plan to hand over the German magazine to the court
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "false" and people wanted to use his name to make themselves known.
His lawyers wanted to bring the German news magazine Der Spiegel (Autumn) to trial, which published the charges.
The forward of the Portuguese national team and the Juventus club was accused of raping American representative Catherine Majorge in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel (Autumn) reported on Friday that he had also paid her $375,000 for keeping the incident secret.
Hours after the allegations were reported, when he appeared on Instagram live in front of 142 million fans, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the news "false".
No, no, no, no.
The man who won the Ball five times told the chamber, "What they are saying today is false".
They are only trying to make themselves known by my name.
This is a normal situation.
They want to make my name known, but that's only half the job.
"I am a happy and good person", the footballer laughed.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the accusations, which they called "a bad report about personal life doubts", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for moral damage in the amount of the severity of the violation, which was probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.
The incident was reported in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting Ronaldo and Major at a nightclub, based on documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada, they returned to the player's room, allegedly raping her anal.
According to the mayor, Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and was a good guy by 99 percent, only one percent of whom turned out to be bad.
The documents confirmed that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but said it was a two-way deal.
The mayor also confirmed that he had contacted the police and photographed his injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a pre-trial settlement, fearing revenge and public humiliation.
A 34-year-old woman is now trying to cancel the deal, as she is still injured in the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had planned to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid during the alleged attack, and this summer Juventus signed him to the Italian giant for 100 million euros.
Brexit - UK exit from the European Union: UK will forever regret losing carmakers
If the UK loses its position as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, it will regret it forever", said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He told the Toyota BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, production will have to be temporarily halted in Bernasson, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese automaker has said that delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Bernaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will stop production", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director at Bernasson.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about the way trade between countries will work and expressed fears of a no-deal exit from the EU.
For example, the British Labour Party has announced that it will close its mini-works in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest fear of automakers is the failure of the supply chain.
The Toyota production line operates on the principle of regularity, and in the UK and EU spare parts arrive every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be delays at the border due to a lack of spare parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold stock for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, so production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said the discussion was based on Theresa May's plan to avoid border checks.
We need the best deal that can continue to benefit from this opportunity, he said in a BBC Radio 4 broadcast called Bugen.
 Toyota and other manufacturers have talked about continuing a highly successful supply chain.
Toyota could not specify the production shutdown dates, but the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tswallaris, who has been working at the Bernaston plant for 24 years, said that his workers became increasingly concerned as they stopped: "In my experience, when jobs go away - they never come back".
A government spokesman said: We have presented a clear and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein may meet again
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the fight for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special adviser investigating Russian election interference, the link between Trump and Russian supporters, and the president's opposition to a fair trial.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the most pressing of Washington's rumors for months.
Rosenstein had already reported in the New York Times this month that he had recorded talks with Trump and that he could be removed from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the suggestion.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, even though reports were spreading that he was about to retire.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when he was at the UN in New York.
Trump said "Rosenstein would be better off not fired", but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a dispute with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of rape, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, gave instructions.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made a speech on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "It was not yet scheduled, it could have been this week, but I think he could have moved on to another week, given all the circumstances with the Supreme Court.
We'll see what happens, I try to keep the press on track.
Some journalists have denied the news that Sanders has not held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the lack of interest in reporters, adding: "I disagree with their desire to present themselves".
He then predicted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
This president holds more Q&A sessions than before", he said, without providing any evidence.We looked at the numbers.
The briefings will continue, but it's much better for journalists to have the opportunity to interview the US president directly than to talk to me.
We've done it many times and we're doing it, you've seen it, and this will be a briefing site for you with the President of the United States.
Trump regularly receives questions from public meetings or conferences with invited high-level guests when he leaves the White House.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week, the president showed why in New York City, meetings with reporters sometimes go unusual.
Health Minister writes a letter to EU staff in Scotland on Brexit
The Minister of Health thanked the EU staff working for the Scottish National Health Service, writing to them that they would like to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman wrote that there were less than six months left before the UK left the EU.
Scotland has taken over the costs of applications for new status for already working EU citizens.
In his letter, Freeman wrote that the negotiations for the UK's exit from the EU, which took place over the summer, continued until the end of the year.
However, the UK is also actively considering its possible exit scenario.
I know that this is a time of great distress for all of you.
So now I appreciate the contributions of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the EU and beyond work together to strengthen and provide valuable healthcare experience and benefit the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay".
Christian Abercrombie joins the emergency room after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury sustained in a loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31-27.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed said the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the side of the line and immediately fell".
The trainers and doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen before taking him to a noxious weed test.
An official in Tennessee, Chris Harris, informed that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there were no reports of any injuries to the victim, and the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
A second-year student of the Red, Abercrombie spent his first season in Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five complete games before leaving the game, which led to his 18 games of the regular season.
Foreigners will pay more in taxes when buying real estate in the UK
Foreigners will pay more in state taxes when buying real estate in the UK, which will be used to help the homeless under new Tories plans
This move will reduce Corbyn ' s attraction to young voters
Increased state tax will affect tax-free people in the UK
The Treasury plans to raise £ 120 million a year to help the homeless
When foreigners buy real estate in the UK, they will pay more in state taxes - the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This move will reduce Jeremy Corbyn's appeal to young voters with promises of more comfortable housing and will shift the focus towards high incomes.
The withdrawn state tax will be levied on tax-free individuals and companies in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will be used for government programs.
The amount of the surcharge can be as much as three percent  in addition to the current state tax, and includes the higher levels introduced for the purchase of housing and rental two years ago.
The Treasury expects the move to generate £120 million a year.
13% of new buildings in London are bought by foreigners, a phenomenon that has led to rising prices and made it difficult for first-time property buyers to climb the residential ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas have become urbanised due to the large number of foreign buyers, especially in the capital, who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy was developed weeks after Boris Johnson urged a reduction in state taxes, with the intention of building young people their first homes.
He accused major construction companies of buying land and misusing it and setting high prices on real estate, and he also urged Mrs. May to abandon housing quotas to correct the British housing disgrace.
Mr. Corbin announced interesting housing reforms, including a call to control rent payments and halt unpaid transfers.
It also wants to give municipalities greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to reviving the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means that we need to repair our collapsed housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and spend their lives here.
But for people who don't live in the UK, it should be easier to buy property for hardworking British people, to have a level playing field with foreign companies.
For many people, the dream of having a home has become too distant, and sleeping on hard ground remains a reality.
Jack Ross said , " My main goal is to manage the Scottish team .
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross set a goal of managing Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish representative is not happy with the task of rebuilding the North-East club, which currently sits third in the Premier League with just three points behind.
After returning to the Scottish Premier League last season, St Mirren moved to the Light Stadium this summer.
I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
They gave me a bag with the inscription В, and that's what Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland SportsSound.
But I grew up watching games with my father in Hampden, Scotland, and I was always attracted to something.
However, such an opportunity will only be possible if the club is successful in managing it.
Prior to Ross, Sunderland's head coaches included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardides, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former owner of Alloa Athletic said he had never been so excited to follow such names at a very big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My current success will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League
With its structure and capabilities, this club is definitely in the Premier League", he said.
It is not an easy task to get the club that far, but only if I can be considered successful.
Ross began his managerial career only three years ago, having previously been assistant manager at Dumbarton and spent 15 months at the Hart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover after falling to the third tier and led the St Mirren team to the title of champion from the bottom positions the following season.
And Ross now feels much more comfortable than he did in his playing career, when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton.
"Maybe it was a real crossroads", he recalled, taking responsibility for Alloa.
I was a genuine believer that management was more for me than a game.
It sounds strange because I have done everything well, lived a meaningful life, and enjoyed success.
But the game can be difficult.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
I still experience stress and pressure at work from time to time, but I enjoy being in charge.
I have always wanted to rule, and now I do, and that is the best feeling I have ever had.
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday 30 September on the Scottish Radio ' s SportsSound programme from 12:00 to 13:00 London time

The summer heat increased the revenue for British pubs, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
According to data, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the business consulting firm CJAI, who is researching these figures, said that the sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that pubs would increase by 2.8% as in July, while restaurants would suffer even more damage.
The decline in restaurant activity in June by 1.8 percent worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that sold alcohol seemed to be much more powerful than the restaurants.
Food-selling pubs were also damaged by the sun, although not as bad as restaurants.
Apparently, people went to pubs just to drink.
Pubs and bars sold alcohol up 6.6% per month, while food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at the Recreation and Hospitality Department of the Ministry of Tourism, said that the results were continuing the trend observed since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain key factors when it comes to sales in the foreign market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, although sales will be particularly difficult to decline by 4.8% year-on-year.
The long hot summer has come at the worst time for food companies, and the average temperatures in August will only show if the current season will allow for a much-needed break.
Sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, were 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in the opening of new companies.
Coffer Pitch Tracker, a sales industry monitor, collects and analyzes productivity data for 47 groups for the UK's pubs, bars and restaurants division and is considered a leading expert in its field, with a combined turnover of around £9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents
A survey found that one in five children - some as young as 11 - has hidden social media accounts from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages on Instagram фейк
This news has increased fears about the proliferation of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a main account to show their parents
One in five children - some by age 11 - has social media accounts that are kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a sharp increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts - along with photo sharing sites like Instagram.
This news has increased fears about the proliferation of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students reported having a clean, open account to show their parents, as well as personal accounts.
A mother who found a secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study by the British Digital Equality and Schools' Conference (HMC) found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them said they had personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, said: "We are concerned that the online world is attracting so many teens to the opportunity to open their pages, where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elide Doyle will be voting for the athletes at the Scottish Council for Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle  Scotland's most titled athlete and chairman of the board, Jan Beatty, sees this step as a great opportunity for those who are leading the sport, saying Doyle's extensive experience over the past decade can be used internationally.
Elyde  Scotland has a great deal of respect from the British and World Athletics Federation and we believe that Scotland will benefit greatly from joining the Athletics Board of Directors "
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is now a regular BBC expert, having lost the ability to walk after a transient seizure.
She tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors told me that it would only be a matter of time before I was resurrected or how much better I would be.
It was a difficult task, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I still do fitness exercises today!
Thank you for your holy letters!
Online advertising comparing mothers to cows shares an opinion
A dairy company shared the idea on the Internet that it compares suckling women to cows in advertising.
With the world's first silent breast implants, technology company Elvy has released an interesting ad to show women the freedom to deliver a new pump.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cow's barn full of grass and there's a song that says, 'Yeah, I sow myself, but you don't see any tail and if you don't see it, it's not cow's milk, it's my breasts.'
And he said, Come, I will feed the young; come, I will sow my seed.
However, the announcement on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions, with many viewers saying it sheds light on the "clutter" aspects of the dairy industry.
It's a bad idea to use cows to advertise this product.
They have to pass on and give birth to babies just like us, and they just steal their babies for a few days after they give birth".
The milk trail from the Elvy firm can be easily installed on a breastfeeding woman's bustle (Elvi/mother)
And another wrote, Behold, this is a wound for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why not use this milkshake ad for mothers who have abandoned their children?
Another person added: "This is such a meaningless advertisement.
Others supported the ad, while one woman found the song to be fun.
 I think that's a brilliant idea.
If I still breastfed my baby, I would have had the same baby.
I felt like a cow when I was digging.
The ad was a little confusing, but I took it as it was.
This is the ideal thing", wrote one.
Another wrote: "This ad is for dairy mothers who often do it in their workplaces or bathrooms and feel like they're "a bitch".
This is not a commercial that praises or blames the dairy industry.
The video ends with the women dancing with small suction cups embedded in the lifespan.
The campaign concept is based on the feeling that many nursing women feel like cows.
Elvie's owl is completely silent, has no tubes, and is inserted into the bra without being sensed, allowing women to hold their babies and even leave during the owl's owl.
Anna Balarin, a partner at the company, said that Elvie's legacy is a revolutionary product that needs to be boldly implemented.
And as we crossed the parallel between the female and the milk cows, we wanted to focus on the breastfeeding and all its problems, and at the same time, to present the feeling of freedom that a new breath would bring in in a fun and light form.
This is not the first time that Elvie's obituary has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, while the mother of two was using the product, designer Marta Yakubovsky was wearing her clothes and walking on the podium.
Hundreds of migrant children move peacefully to the Palattina camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although border crossings remain relatively unchanged, partly due to the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult to place children in sponsorships.
Most donors are usually illegal immigrants themselves who have taken steps to stay in the country at the risk of not being able to.
The numbers increased sharply in June when the federal government announced that donors and other senior members of their families are required to submit fingerprints and that this information will be submitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albens told Congress that dozens of people who had applied for a minor donation had been arrested.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
Nearly 80 percent of those who have donors or family members are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these people", Mr. Albenz said.
To speed up the process, the authorities introduced new rules that require foreigners to appear in court within a month, not 60 days after their arrest, as was the custom.
Many of them contact the immigration judge via video rather than in person to submit a request for their legal status.
Those who are not needed will be deported quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the greater their chances of becoming anxious or depressed, which could lead to violence or evasion, according to shelter officials and sources of information that have come in from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that these fears can be amplified in a larger institution, such as a large institution like Tornillo, where the child's signs of struggle are not visible because of his size.
They say that moving children to a tent town may intensify the wound that many struggle with because of lack of emotional preparation or time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muqalim also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eighth year of war.
Also, al-Mu'galim, who was the deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were illegally stationed on Syrian soil under the banner of counterterrorism, and that the campaign would be appropriate.
They must leave without delay and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
According to al-Mu'galim, the war on terror is almost over, with 360,000 people killed in Syria since 2011, and millions more displaced.
And he said, This holy war shall not cease, until we have purged the land of Syria from the terrorists and from the lawless ones of the land.
The United States has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in a war-torn country.
Syrian diplomat Walid al-Muhalim said the conditions for their return were good and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that forced refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with the repatriation", he said.
"They are simply politicizing the issue that should be humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Bashar al-Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the United Nations (UN) said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib Province had opened the way for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Trussian agreement warned of a large-scale military attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Walid al-Muhalim stressed that the agreement had "a precise timing" and said he hoped that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the militants of the An-Nusra Front associated with the terrorist organization "Al-Qaeda", who would be "destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition representatives to develop Syria's post-war constitution and prepare favorable conditions for elections.
Walid al-Mugalim explained the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee's work: the committee meetings should be limited to "examination of existing constitutional articles" and should be warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump Will Win the Second Presidential Election
Under this manticide, Donald Trump will win re-election in 2020, as many liberal supporters expect, unless impeachment and controversy put an end to his presidency prematurely.
Of course, this would be "the most dramatic end of the presidency in history".
At present, the supporters have no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's evening viewing ratings have doubled (up to 1 million 50 thousand) and MSNBC's has tripled (up to 1,600,000).
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2 million 400,000 evening viewers (compared to 1 million 700,000 viewers as of 4 years ago), while MSNBC's "Rachel Maddou Show" has led cable television ratings among the top night news programs with 3 million 500,000 viewers.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it", said Neil Baer, executive producer of the drama "The Last Candidate", about a Cabinet member who became president after the demolition of the US Capitol building.
Nell Shovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just Funny Moments: And a Few Hard Truths About Interfering in the Hollywood Boys Club" has a different opinion.
He recalls what happened in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why?" asked Nell Showell.
"Because he makes me laugh", the traveler replied.
Even in this confusion, there may be room for play.
Of course, unlike the rest of the television, the course of events in the American administration against the notorious Rowway may determine the future of both the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the state of the global economy.
The ability to escape from it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, if you watch a 6-hour panel of experts discuss the use of "anonymous source" by author Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", political consultant Paul Manafort's review of a 15 thousand dollar (currently 1 million 128,750 rupees) turkey-skin purse (a garment that showed a high degree of pride) or Stormy Daniels' startling talk about parts of Donald Trump's body, eh, these reports are beyond the limits of being a citizen.
For example, my attitude toward the game Super Mario will never be the same again.
"Part of the stuff he does and makes a reality show impact is the sense of 'squeezing you out with something every night,'" said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wilhouse Entertainment and producer of the series "Lombard Stars", about the changing cast and the daily dramatic changes that occur (discussions with players from the National Football League, praise of Kim Jong-un).

This week I went to the home of producer and writer Mike Flaiss on the north shore of Kauai, and it was 27 degrees Celsius outside, but he was hiding inside and watching MSNBC while he was writing CNN.
He could not ignore the case of Brett Kavanaugh, who was soon to appear before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but he was concerned not for himself but for the future of the defendant, the Supreme Court, which was on the sidelines.
"I remember when we used to do this kind of stuff, and people were like, 'This is the end of Western culture,'" Mike Flaiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Foreign money is harshing the election campaign
Not surprisingly, the re-grouping caused a cash flow to the 17th Pennsylvania constituency, which had gained circulation, resulting in two incumbent presidents running for the same seat.
In the recently renovated Pittsburgh suburb, Connor Lamb, a Republican Democrat, took office in another district in the last spring by-election.
Lamb is running against another incumbent candidate, Republican Kate Rothfuss; she is currently representing Pennsylvania's former 12th Congressional District, which in many ways resembles the new 17th District.
The boundaries of the counties were moved in January after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized that the boundaries had been changed unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district caused a dispute between the party's main financial bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress (DCC) and the National Republican Congress Committee (NRCC), over the campaign's funding.
Connor Lamb's name was recognized in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the March special election for the 18th electoral district.
The Republican held the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts gave little priority to the Democrats.
The United States rejects the Republic of El Salvador by considering the pros and cons of sanctions for supporting China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and the Republic of Panama had already recognized Beijing, although Washington had almost no opposition.
US President Donald Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varella of the Republic of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until he was fired by the Trump Organization's management team due to partners.
Officials of the U.S. State Department have agreed to recall diplomatic representation officials from the U.S. Republics of El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the decision to no longer recognize Taiwan soon", the department's official spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the fines were only against the Republic of El Salvador; in 2017, the United States gave him $140 million in estimates for drug trafficking control, advancement and economic support.
Cutting financial aid and paying fines that include special visa restrictions would be a challenge for a Central American country with high rates of unemployment and murder.
During the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America decided to postpone a high-level meeting on security and economic development to continue what was considered a further development in an effort to prevent immigration to the United States that same year.
However, by mid-September, the top management had made it clear that it wanted a conference, so it was clear that it would effectively suspend any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, as the administration recognizes the significance of the meeting.
In addition, three American diplomats returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without further warning or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on the subject of internal discussions in anonymity.
Their statements were also confirmed by an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, close to the administration.
History is a must learn
The next step may be to report that the special counsel to the President, Robert Mueller, may have interfered with Trump's possible fair trial, which is now well documented in public use.
Robert Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether or not Trump's campaign was a criminal deal with Russia during the US presidential election.
If the Congress were to take over the reins, Donald Trump would still be held accountable to him, just as he would be prepared to stand before the electorate again and, eventually, before the jury of his colleagues.
I don't want to say that Trump's and his European colleagues' fall is inevitable.
We all have to stand on both sides of the Atlantic and decide how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the West supported them and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape the bloody wars that had been going on for years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unceasing movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now experiencing several of these turning points.
What would we do if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who controlled the fate of Robert Müller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the paper secretly proposed to write the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for the position.
Rod Rosenstein says the Times' accounts are inaccurate.
"If the recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh, as requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is not complete or fair or is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite reliable and dishonest instructions about sexual assault, how will we respond?"
And, above all, will we vote for Congress in the middle of the term that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I am confident that we will not be defeated because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such a rich legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?'

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers football club looks optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Reingers team will play against Rapid Vienna, after a shocking draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, Reingers know that a win over the Austrians will allow them to advance to the Europa League Group G.
A quick injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance this season before a 2:2 draw with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers could use the result as a trampoline.
"It was a good moment for us, because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We thought we could get something for the match and we went with one point.
We could eventually defeat them, but overall, the result may have been fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
Friday night will be a very important day for Europe.
I'm sure we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in the last game, but given the crowd behind us, we're going to continue and we're going to get a positive result.
The past year has been difficult, and the injuries I have had and the changes in the club itself have been difficult, but now this place has made me feel better.
The team is good, and the young ones love it; physical training is good.
I believe that we can now put the past season behind us and continue to play with new achievements.
Women lose sleep after retirement for fear of running out of money
Although the respondents clearly understood how they should care for themselves, they spoke little to their families about it.
Only about half of the participants in a survey conducted by the company Nashnueid said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10% of respondents said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance division at Nashnueid.
What should I do?
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not discuss your needs beforehand, you will not be able to prepare your family for support.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get help, as this information can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
You can also ask your financial advisor to help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash to cover those expenses, or, if you have money, a self-insurance policy with your own condition.
Prepare your legal documents: Warn in advance of legal disputes.
Remove the medical records, and if you cannot communicate, your appointed trusted person will monitor your medical care and your requests.
Also, remove the trust deed.
If you are unable to qualify, choose a trusted entity that will make financial decisions for you and cover your expenses.
Remember, imagine that your elderly parents are in urgent need of medical attention.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
To prepare yourself, write down the information.
"The issue is not just financial statements but also the knowledge of doctors", says Martin.
"What medicines?
Who will take care of the meat?
Please have written answers to these questions.

When the man returned home from work at night, he was shot several times with a pneumatic pistol.
The 40-year-old victim was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand while in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police called the incident, which occurred at 2:30 p.m. (British summer time), a "speech of the hour".
The man who was injured did not see the assailant.
His wounds are not life-threatening, but police are looking for witnesses who witnessed the shooting.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis
Officials said at least 384 people were killed and the death toll is expected to rise as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday.
Due to the lack of communication routes, officials involved in humanitarian assistance were unable to obtain any information from the areas north of Donggal County and Palua, which were left in the epicenter of a magnitude 7.5-point earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the city of Palou.
Here are some important facts about the city of Palo on Sulawesi and Donggal County:
Palo is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province; it is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800 as of 2017.
The city's residents had celebrated its 40th anniversary at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district on the northwestern side of Sulawesi Island, extending over 300 kilometers along the coast.
The county (lower administrative district within the province) has a population of about 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy in central Sulawesi province and especially in the coastal Donggala district.
Nickel mining also occupies a significant place in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morarau County, on the opposite shores of the island.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Response, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami waves killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic belt of the Pacific Ocean and is constantly subject to earthquakes.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
December 26, 2004: A powerful earthquake and tsunami hit 14 countries on the western coast of Aceh province, north of Sumatra, Indonesia, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people perished on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern coast of Indonesia's densest island of Java, causing tsunami waves that killed about 700 people.
In 2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, destroying ten villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake that year shocked the Pidjaya district of Achech Province and caused panic among residents as people recalled the devastating effects of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed many people.
This time, there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings left more than 100 dead.
2018: A major earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people (mainly in the northern part of the island).
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in distress.
Sarah Palin ' s eldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
On Saturday, Alaska State Police reported that 29-year-old Track Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse, including perverting the course of justice while preparing and delaying a report.
According to the account, a woman familiar with Palin's family tried to call the police to report the crimes that Trac had committed, but they took the phone from her hand.
Palin was held in the Mat-Suu Valley detention center in Matanuska-Susitna, but was released by the police after a $500 bail, reports KTUU, a regional news network in the state of Alaska.
The trial was on a Saturday - when he was asked to plead not guilty, the network said that he was "clearly innocent".
Trace Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day suspended sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been brought against Trac Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, including account-based violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His daughter, who was walking with him, also accused him of hitting his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for linking her self-aggressive behavior to her son's post-traumatic disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
On Friday, at least 384 people died in an earthquake on Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are down, and the death toll is expected to increase in the near future.
The earthquake struck only the central part of Sulawesi, a small island northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media sites are full of videos of earthquakes.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palo were hit by the tsunami.
U.S. federal prosecutors demand a special death sentence for the suspect in the New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors are asking Syphyllum Saippo, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, to be sentenced to death for a special, federal crime that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov, on the other hand, drove a rented Home Depot truck along the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on a bicycle path and carrying out an armed attack.
Prosecutors who announced plans to carry out the death penalty in New York's Southern District will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" committed eight murders and sustained serious bodily injuries to justify the death sentence.
The court may issue a death sentence based on both points.
A few weeks after the attack, members of the Grand Jury of the Federal Court issued a 22-point indictment to Sayfullo Saipov; it indicted him for 8 murders with intent to intimidate, usually theft and destruction of vehicles used in organized crime cases by federal prosecutors.
The prosecutor's office said that the attack was a "seriously planned and well-thought-out" crime, carried out in a "horrible, brutal and malicious manner".
"Saipov, the son of Saifulló Habibulló, has caused grief, sorrow and harm to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cléves, Anne-Lor Decadth, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlije, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucco", the report said.
Five of the dead were tourists from the Argentine Republic.
The last death penalty case in the Southern District of New York was filed a decade ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was carried out by a New York federal case against a couple convicted of espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union two years before the start of the Cold War in 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
The Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court records, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack in the months and days following.
According to the police, he confessed to the investigators that he was not guilty of his actions and that he felt good.
According to the prosecution's assessment, Saipov was inspired to carry out the attack after viewing the videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room, reports the police officer.
Saypov pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "depressed" to learn of their indictment.
"We thought that getting a sentence other than a guilty plea and the possibility of life imprisonment instead of the death penalty would only prolong the work and the wounds of all participants", said David Patton.
A group of Saipov's defenders had earlier asked the prosecutor's office not to carry out the death penalty.
Conservative MPs believe that the negotiations on Brexit should be handed over to Nigel Faraj
Today, during a protest at the Tory party conference, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party suggested that politicians should feel the "exciting moods" of the Eurosceptics, as Theresa May, as one of her own deputies, suggested that she should hold talks with the European Union.
At the March in Birmingham, conservative-minded MP Peter Boone said that if the UK had taken over the Brexit job, Britain would "come out of the game soon enough".
But the issue that arose when Theresa May reconciled her deeply divided ranks was the involvement of Tory supporters of the anti-Brexit movement in the city.
Despite the attacks by Brexit and its opponents, the British Prime Minister has tried various ways to implement his Checker compromise plan.
The Allies stressed that he would continue to seek a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and would also force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and "confusion".
Peter Boone told the participants of the "Exit means Exit" rally in Solihull that he found "the Checker's plan unnecessary.
He suggested that Nigel Farrah should be given equal rights and entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for Brexit, this would have been over a long time ago", he said.
The Wellingborough constituency MP: <seg id="11" Translator-id='User 04'>"I will support Brexit, but we need to abandon the Cекерs plan", he added.
He expressed his opposition to the European Union: "We have not participated in world wars to remain subservient.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country".
Peter Boone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "It is completely unfair to think that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay".
And Andrea Jenkins, a Brexit supporter from the Tory Party, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just said, honourable Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checker's plan is not well known among the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular among our parties and activists who are calling for elections in the streets in the first place.
Please, put away the jokes and start listening.
In her address to Theresa May, she added: "Prime Ministers only keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Nigel Faraj said that among the politicians who were attending the rally, those who were planning to sell the resolution adopted in the 2016 referendum should be "strongly opposed".
"Now it's about trust between us, the people and our political class", he said.
"They try to prevent Brexit, but we have to say to them today, 'We won't let you do that.'
Addressing the inspired crowd, he added: "I want you to show your strong opposition to our political class, which is on the brink of betraying Brexit.
"We are mobilizing this country's people's army to win Brexit and we will not rest until we have an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham and held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group started working in these camps, a small group of activists raised their banners "Tori against Brexit".
When the meeting began, Labour Party Lord Adonis derided the emergence of security problems due to the new members joining the Conservative Party.
"These are the people who tell us that we need IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for an uncontested border, for free trade outside the Irish border", he said.
"This is completely Persian.
"There will never be a Brexit that is comfortable for everyone", he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "really consider" her candidacy for the U.S. presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she "really thinks" about voting for her presidential candidacy after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat spoke about his future Saturday at the Massachusetts Western Town Hall.
Elizabeth Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Republican State Representative and Trump campaign chairman Jeff Deal in Massachusetts in 2016.
There were also rumors that he might run for president with Donald Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event, held after Trump took office, was the 36th in the order of Elizabeth Warren's meetings with voters at the town hall.
During the meeting, a man asked him if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that "it's time for women to go to Washington to improve our collapsed government, including the status of women at the top".
Basketball player Wade Sims arrested in connection with the murder
Baton Rouge police announced that Wade Sims, a player for the Louisiana State University basketball team, was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of Friday's murder.
The police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the man.
Wade Sims, 20, was shot and killed in the early hours of Friday outside a small town on the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday at 247Sports.com.
Dayton Simpson shot and killed Wade Simpson after he went forward to defend his friend.
Simpson was interviewed, and admitted to being at the scene and to having his weapon with him, as well as to having his own horse for Wade Sims.
Simpson refused to resist the police and was imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Growing up in Baton Rouge, 198-inch, Wade Sims played in 32 games out of 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton retains the title of world champion after defeating the Ferrari driver Sebastian Fettel with his team's tactics.
On Saturday, after Lewis Hamilton's teammate, Valterie Bottas, qualified early, it became clear that Mercedes' tactics were a big part of the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, moving from the first position, and did not leave Hamilton helpless, trying to maintain his position in the first two laps and at the same time allowing Fettell to overtake his team-mate.
Fettel was the first to enter the box and leave Hamilton in the tail of the carriage - a defining moment in the race.
Mercedes went into the pit stop after one lap and followed Fettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a brief collision with the wheels, resulting in Ferrari pilot reluctantly leaving the inside of the road to defend himself in the third turn after a double lap.
To mark his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen took the rear of the starting line and came seventh after the first round.
He then quickly ran much of the race at his own pace to reach the finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and finishing 4th.
He eventually entered the boxer's 44th round, but gave Raikkonen fourth place in the remaining 8 rounds before he could boost his pace.
And it was a hard day; for Walter had done a terrible thing all the Sabbaths, and he was a man of integrity, and he had given me a way.
Our team did such a wonderful job of getting first and second place".
This was a very rude act
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked California state senator Diane Feinstein for not admitting to the offence of spying on the wife of Christine Blazey Ford, who was accused of sexual assault by U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Trump cited Christine Ford's remarks before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in a speech in West Virginia, describing what was happening in the Senate as "disgusting, disgusting and false".
"In the only possible and beautiful moments in the Senate in the last few days, we have seen people who are evil, angry, disgusting, disgusting and lying", he said.
"You look at all the ads and the spread, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I did not do that".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disseminate it?
Do you remember his answer... did you spread the document out?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not spread it".
Okay, wait a minute.
We have dispersed...No, we have not dispersed", he added, impressed by the senator.
A letter from Ford to Feinstein was sent in July of the charges against Kavanaugh, and it had been sent earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the distribution had left his office.
"I didn't hide the doctor. I didn't reveal Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential".
But the president was apparently unhappy with his refusal, for he probably commented during a rally Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that was really bad body language.
He may not know it, but it is the worst body language I have ever seen".
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats had used the charges to their advantage.
"They are determined to restore power by whatever means they can.
You see the filth, the ugliness, whoever they offend, whoever they topple to take power and control, they don't care",  reported Mediaite in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 The Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars won the Triple-A Elite League game against the Belfast Giants on Saturday with a score of 5-1.
The giants, Parik Dwyer and Francis Bouvilier, scored two goals in the first half.
Before Dwyer reestablished the leadership of the Giants, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney rose to the rank of housewife.
Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals tied the score in Dundee's favour before ensuring a win for Dundee.
Adam Keefe's was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League, having defeated Dundee 2-1 on Friday evening in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the third minute at 3:35 with Kendall MacFall, while David Rutherford scored, and Broville doubled the lead after four minutes.
In a tense opening period, Matt Markward tied the score at 15:16 with Coney, before Sullivan returned the field with a 13:10 lead.
Duyer was convinced that the Giants had made the first break when he scored his second goal during the night at the end of the first period.
The owners were grouped together and Busar usually counted in 27:37 to tie them again.
Covney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the front of the game for the first time in the second period and he secured his fifth team's victory in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will be on their home field on Friday with Milton Keynes in the next game.
An air traffic controller died to save hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
In Indonesia, the aviation dispatcher is known as a hero after his death, for his role in the flight of hundreds of people.
On Friday, more than 800 people died and many vanished without a trace after a powerful tsunami quake struck Sulawesi.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many of them are in ruins in the city of Palo.
However, while his colleagues escaped, the 21-year-old Antoninus Guanavan Agung Palú Mutiara refused to leave his post from the dispatch desk at the Sisi Al-Jufri airport.
He stayed in place to ensure the safe flight of the Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft, which was in the process of being flown.
Then he jumped from the gate, thinking that the guards' shield would fall.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation Press Secretary Johannes Syrait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
To take her to a large hospital in another city, we prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Calimantan.
Sadly, we lost the helicopter this morning before it arrived in Palou.
"When we hear about this, our hearts are broken", he added.
At the same time, authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach a thousand, as the country's natural disaster mitigation agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
"The number of casualties is believed to be increasing, as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot be reached", said Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Sutopo agency.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, carried Paul away, and on Sunday there was a large burial.
Military and commercial aircraft provide relief and props.
"Every minute, bodies bring emergency help", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother to Sky News.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It is a tragedy, but it can be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo Alto on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in the Indonesian island of Lombok caused more than 550 deaths.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person was missing in a plane crash in a lagoon
An airline operating a crashed flight in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports an unidentified missing person, with 47 passengers and crew reportedly successfully evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that the airline was unable to locate a male passenger at dusk on Saturday.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's identity, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew when the plane crashed at Chuuk Island airport while attempting to board.
Officials reported that seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
The exact cause of the disaster and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy announced that the plane had landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane passed by the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jens, said the plane was too low.
"That's great", said Jane.
Janez explained that she and others were able to get to the crash site of a sunken plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the seamen who were working on the harbor's improvements helped rescue the boat by taking people ashore until the plane sank to a depth of 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
Analyst told about the woman being burned alive at night
On Saturday, the prosecution substantiated its evidence in reviewing the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
In a matter of hours, U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett gave instructions as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers used cell phone records to gather traffic on the night of their death.
Information from several telephone calls on the location indicated that Tells was with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to his previous confirmations, reports Rowlett's words in The Clarion Ledger.
While Tellis was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford when information showed that Chambers' cell phone was with him.
Sanford took a Saturday break and indicated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he showed that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied, "He lied, my truck was in Nashville that night".
Tellys said she knew Chambers about two weeks before his death, which was another mismatch.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis said she deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone, Rowlett said.
"He took her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense is expected to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The ruler ordered that the jury should wait for the matter to be heard that same day.
The High Breed: What is intelligent hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio opposes their negative views of the genre and wants to fill the music with positive messages.
Hip-hop avoids the source of political messages and deals with social issues, says the Bristol-based band The High Breed.
They want to get back to the rat race and popularize intelligent hip-hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common, recently, have been witnesses to the revival in the UK with the help of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A New York nanny sued a couple for dismissal after writing "racism"
After complaining that a New York nanny was a black man, she filed a lawsuit against a married couple for dismissal for discriminatory conduct after receiving a misrepresentation from her mother.
The couple rejected their racist position by comparing the claim to "burning money".
Lindsay Plasto-Flacksman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she learned that Giselle Morris, a new childcare provider, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"It's a very hard thing to be a swimmer", Mrs. Placebo-Flacksman wrote to her husband.
Instead of sending her to her husband, she sent the same message to Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Placo-Flacksman nanny, an African-American girl, did poorly and dismissed Mr. Morris by saying she was expecting a Filipino woman instead, the New York Post reported.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for their retirement and, although without a contract, is claiming $350 a day for the six months they have previously lived in a rented household.
"I want to show them, listen, you don't do this kind of thing", he told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to a complaint that they were racist and said it was wise to fire Morris because they would not believe him after the mockery.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people", her husband, Joel Plasto, told Post.
"But if you were to mock, would you hand your child over to a man?
Your newborn child?
I'm all right".
Comparing the claim to "burning money", Placebo tells his wife that he has only two months left before the baby is born and that he is "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to follow this man?
This is not a good practice", the investment banker added.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion rushed to accuse the couple on several social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would ignore the talking bear, says a new letter.
Shortly after the book was received, Bond's daughter Karen Jankel said of the mistake: "It is hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It is interesting to note that we know of Paddington's great success now".
He said that his father, who worked as a BBC operator, would have been optimistic before he inspired the little toy bear to write a children's book, saying that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "open-ended" after his death last year.
Describing Paddington as "a very important member of our family", he added that his father was very calmly proud of his accomplishments.
"He was a very calm man and didn't brag", she said.
"But because Paddington is so real to him, it's like he's a child of your accomplishments and you're proud of him, even if it's not your job.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Although this was his invention, he always valued himself as Paddington".
My daughter was born and I had to say goodbye by phone
During the grounding, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called constantly to tell me that it was really bad, that it was unexpected", said Mr. Ednan-Laperois.
"Mother Nad called me and told me that she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We will be together soon.
I will be with you.
The medications that doctors prescribed to keep her heart functioning gradually ran out of her body.
And he died a little while, and all this was over.
He knew that this was all happening and he just sat down and waited for me.
I could not cry or cry because I was in the midst of family and people.
I really needed to keep it together".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperois, who was tearing her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the other passengers, ignoring the trials she had gone through.
"No one knows", he replied.
"I was depressed and wept constantly.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt the love for Nad.
I felt that I needed to show him my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women in mourning put up posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries placed telephone numbers and encouraging postcards on the Valley Bridge to help people reach out to the relief service.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, began to suffer from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like me every day", she said.
Miss Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, had a son who was a contagiously smiling promising cook.
"Everyone knew her smile.
They said that her smile would light up any room".
But before he died, he abandoned his work, for he was indeed "in the dark places".
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler met his older brother after committing suicide.
"I'm always worried that this will have some effect", said Miss Davis.
"To let everyone know that there are people to talk to", Miss Davis created posters.
You have to sit and talk".
Miss Humphries, a longtime friend of Miss Davis, soon lost her 15-year-old partner Mark after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he felt bad or anything like that", she said.
"One or two days before Christmas, we saw a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day, he was in the barn and when he opened the children's presents, he didn't look at them".
His death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it, he said.
That's what separates us.
But we all have to keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the line as the FBI begins an investigation
"I think if we could get what he asked for, we would have a limited time to investigate, a limited volume, maybe we would have brought some unity", Mr. Flacke said on Saturday, adding that the committee feared the guerrillas would eventually collapse.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is explained by the time.
With only five weeks left before the midterm elections, on November 6, if Republicans are approved, they will seriously weaken their efforts to elect the person who wants to be elected to the Supreme Court of their country.
George W. Bush, who worked at the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, endorsed Mr. Kavanaugh and called the senators and raised the phone.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
The vote will be in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet known whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win 50 votes in the Senate chamber, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and uphold it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans who migrated decreased under Kim
The number of North Korean migrants to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean deputy said.
Park Ben Seug, citing the ministry's data for the Southern Commonwealth, said there were 1127 deserters last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors are border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates levied by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of the migrants from the north were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, the longest border with North Korea, which is easier than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that is carefully maintained between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which were still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks, which centered on denuclearization.
This was after a historic meeting in Singapore in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they agreed to work on the Korean Peninsula in general.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yen-ho accused US sanctions of not making any progress since then.
"Without some confidence in the United States, our National Security Service will not have confidence, and in such circumstances we cannot initially arm unilaterally", said Mr. Ri, speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and declared her temperament unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman ever makes a speech like this, they'll say isterica", Pelosi said on Friday about her reaction to Kavanaugh's remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied that Dr. Christine had raped Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming, and silent as they discussed his family and high school years.
He also denounced Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by liberals who were unhappy with Hillary Clinton's lead in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's orders confirm his inability to serve on the Supreme Court because they show his intentions against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these applications and he's disqualifying himself with the persecution of Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi refused when asked if he would seek to declare Kavanaugh's impeachment if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not just fit to be in the Supreme Court, but he's not fit to be in the courtroom right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District of Columbia, serving as a judge of the District Court of Appeals.
As a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade Act, as he was considered a conservative judge, Pelosi added.
At the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh declined to comment on whether the Supreme Court would overturn some of the decisions.
"I'm afraid that when an unjust man comes to court, he shouldn't think we'll be happy with him", said Pelosi.
And women should use that.
And he hath filled it with holy months and years, and he hath not gone out without weeping.
"When we're angry, we cry", said Miss Stein 45 years later.
"I think this is normal, what do you think?"
He continued: "I was helped by a lady who was a leader somewhere, and she was also crying when she was angry, but she did this technique that when she started crying, she said to the man, 'I'm crying because I might think it's monsoon.'
I am angry".
Then he went on his way.
And I thought, "This is great".
Tears are allowed to come out of a misunderstanding to anger.
One of the brightest memories of working in a man-owned office, where I once found myself crying over unimaginable poverty, was when an older woman, a cold manager, who was always a little scared, caught me in a cage and put me in the hallway.
"Never let them see you crying", he told me.
"They do not know that you are angry.
They will think you are a fool and will be happy to get you out of their own way".
Patricia Schröder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart dropped out of the race after a extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, Mrs. Schroeder, so frustrated, felt that she should not study the idea of a presidential election herself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", he said, laughing after 30 years.
"Seven other candidates have already entered the competition, and the last one they need is another candidate.
Some called it "Belozzina and the Seven Gnomes".
Due to the end of his campaign, he lagged behind in raising money and vowed not to run until he had raised $2 million.
The struggle was intense.
He found that some of his followers gave him $1,000 to men, and that he received only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not run for office, he was filled with emotions, thanks to his supporters, dissatisfaction with the system that made it difficult to raise money and attract voters' attention.
"You would think I was a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schröder recalled of the press' reaction to her.
"You could think that Clinix was my corporate donation.
I remember thinking, 'What will they write on my grave?'
"She was crying"?"
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first leaps of the trade war between the United States and China were strong, and that although the war is far from over, the spread between the countries could be profitable for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, lead and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week was due to new tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars (£150 billion), which in fact taxed half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing also responded that it had recently imposed tariffs on American goods of five to ten percent, amounting to $60 billion.
China has promised not to leave the US, and the second largest world economy will not die soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw would be a submission to the demands, but public worship of the United States would be uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the US trade war pressure could reduce the interdependence between the two economies and provide positive support to China in the long run, experts say.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing creates conditions for the launch of an economic storm in any country is actually a far more dangerous fact than observers recognize", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Asia.
Syrian refugees "ready to return", Foreign Minister says
Syria has said it is ready to return the refugees freely and is seeking help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation is more stable and safe today as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the districts destroyed by terrorists.
At present, all conditions have been created for the free return of refugees who have been forced to leave their daily lives and their livelihoods by terrorism and unilateral economic measures.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime will help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not receive conditional support from countries that supported the rebel movement.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup by 16.5 to 10.5 points, defeating the US team at Le Golf National in Paris in 2018.
The United States has won the European Cup six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When the Danish captain Thomas Björn scored the necessary 14.5 points to win the US, Europe returned the crown.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who wrestled for much of the tournament, defeated Francesco Molinari in his match and scored in the 16th hole in the par-3 draw.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to come out 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit of Denmark beat Torbjörn Olesen of the European team with the lowest rating to 5 and 4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, defeated England's Ian Poulter 2-1, who played in his last Ryder Cup, probably.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European in tournament history with 25.5 points during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but there's nothing I can do today.
It was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I am so happy to have the trophy back.
"You're talking about the team, and I'm glad I can help", Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the torch to fellow American golfer Tiger Woods, who defeated him 2-1 in a single-handed draw on Sunday, to John Ram.
"I'm so proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team, apart from Patrick Reida, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, played high-level golf throughout the tournament, trying to find a weekend fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning was a bit of a warm Europe.
We gave up.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're going to change the team, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I like these 12 young men, and I am proud to serve as a captain.
You must put on the hat.
We were defeated".
Red-water uplift: decreased concentration in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a decline in the concentration of red water elevation in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Fish and Wildlife Commission, several different conditions of flowering are identified in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which imply decreased concentrations.
The red tide rises along a coastline of about 130 miles from the Northern Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
The finds are located about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they have decreased compared to last week.
Red water was also observed in the vicinity of Pasco.
Average concentrations were observed in Pinellas County or its shores last week, from low to high concentrations on the shores of Hillsborough County, from bottom to high concentration in Manatee County, from bottom to high concentrations in Sarasota County or at sea, from bottom to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, from bottom to high concentrations in Lee County or beyond, and low concentrations in Collier County.
The storm has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties as before.
There have been no reports of airway rage in Northwest Florida in the past week.
