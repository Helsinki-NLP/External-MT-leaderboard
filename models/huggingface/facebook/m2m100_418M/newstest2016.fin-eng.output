9-Year-Old Boy Found in Istanbul
Police have been searching for a 9-year-old boy on Tuesday afternoon in Tampere.
The disappearance announcement of the boy with his boyfriend from West Tampere has been spread on social media.
According to the police, the boy has been contacted and he is not at risk for his life and health.
The son's father told Lita-Sanom at midnight knowing that the son was found.
He’s okay and we’re going to start the post-examination.
The son was found in the neighborhood of the house, the father said.
Ronaldo is back in a row, scratching to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League in the weekend and continued his factory in the Champions League.
The struggle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goalkeeper turned at least for a moment to the last advantage.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalkeeper statistics when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of punishment and one of the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his March score to 80 when on Tuesday's Barcelona match he had a score of 77 goals.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has compurished in the Italian football league in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League D class it started strongly with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City.
The victory was made a few minutes before Juventus's final Alvaro Morata.
The city attack was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's election game, came to the field only in the last 10 minutes.
Also Manchester's second team United suffered hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering 1-2-tape.
ManU’s 20-year-old lawmaker Luke Shaw’s struggle lasted only a hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking scratch hit the scratch towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw'l is likely to be broken.
Shaw slept at the end of the Eindhoven home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff went to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay brought the guests to 1-0 in the 41st minute, but ManU's pleasure lasted just a few minutes.
Moreno balanced before the break with an additional time.
PSV won in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season in the Champions League started by Paris Saint-Germain.
It was the Argentine Angel Di Maria who replaced Manchester United's shirt for PSG.
Di Maria broke through to the right and lifted the ball over the back corner of Malmö's painter Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the successful seasons.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the small leagues of the league, is not the best possible reference point.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost 0-1 against Wolfsburg in the B-Lock match in Germany.
The opposition demanded immediate dismissal - the president made the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had held a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has repeatedly held the same speech in the country's parliament in the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe obviously did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full life.
The MDC has called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants hurried to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe’s headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed before and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria call for an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Chairman of the European Council, Donald Tusk, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make Europe more effectively registered.
According to Merkel, negotiations on asylum quotas are on the table of the Ministers of the Interior.
Teacher acknowledges shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call
The sound only a little colorful university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb emphasized that her “gold dog” was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman were found on the phone.
From the inside of the house, the police found a handwritten message to Amy Prentiss's body and to the side of the wrath: "I'm so sorry I hope I can withdraw this beloved Amya and she's the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter, which experts say is signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Cleveland in Minnesota, had already travelled 500 kilometers to the campus of the school where the police believe that he shot and killed the storytelling teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this workshop.
Lynn Buford, the police chief at Delta State University, said the university officials heard the shooting at 10.18 p.m.
She said Lamb had called a fatal emergency call a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of dead increased by another one: Lamb committed suicide when the police surrounded the womb.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motives a day after students and staff had to hide behind closed doors due to a school shooting.
Scientists on both sides of the state have published data that students and staff described Lambia as a talented teacher, but with potential problems.
The students said they were waiting for his feelings.
The police of Prentice's death site, Gautier, said Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked “mighty people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended both men's courses.
There were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers cried Lambia, but said he also looked nervous and nervous, “as if something had been wrong.”
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lambin told him that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously requested a vacation from the Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s wage principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it didn’t guarantee him automatic career development and the post of assistant professor.
William LaForge, director of the university, said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt as he knew, but that “clarely Lamb had something in mind.”
These questions can no longer be answered.
After Lamb had escaped from the campus, the police found him behind when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol at the back of a house about a half-kilometre south of his parents' house in the Mississippi Greenville suburb, said Washington county death prosecutor Methel Johnson.
Lamb’s car was still on the road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and educational sciences. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his PhD in Education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through common friends.
Hairston and his friends were at school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play the guitar.
He was a great gentleman at that time.
All the girls were swallowed when he was there, said now the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been together for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the river's tile house in Gautier.
The police said the dog was well.
Prince's former husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
“He’s really shocked,” O’Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother’s best friend.
O’Steen said he hadn’t met Lambia, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together with a couple of cakes.
O’Steen told her daughter to make and sing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different network companies.
Mike Shaffer, the barmaker and occasionally entertaining organizer of The Julep Room, near Gautier, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss for the last time in the night of September 5, when Lamb had stopped showing his guitar and lips to a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
“Only a happy couple,” he said.
We scratched and scratched each other.
They were both pretty crazy.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the student's first year seminar program and was specialized in Indian and colonial history, said the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was a spokesman for his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday evening at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, a candlestick was held, involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the exhibition, during which the university choro singed songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It is time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi’s Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb had called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they had been married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the vacation period
Toys R Us says it doesn’t pay as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but the toy and baby product retailer says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 employees in the 2014 vacation period.
Most work is part-time.
The company said that the applicant interviews will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although the holidays are months, the shopping season of the Christmas time is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help occupy stores and sell, send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox laughed on his “treff” with Princess Diana
Back to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the king’s arrival, and I realized that my seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” she said in the coming documentary Back in Time trailer.
The movie begins, and I think I’m just a craftsmanship and a hand stretch away from a meeting with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary from the film Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future took its first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “For me, it’s undeniably the greatest time travel film ever.”
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD, and in some theaters in October.
UN Secretary says the situation in Syria will not be resolved armedly
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia’s increased military support to Syria is that this almost five-year conflict “will not be resolved armedly” and additional weapons will only aggravate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN head again urged all parties, including the Divided Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on a press conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the context of the General Meeting Ministry Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the people of Syria and the regional forces “have made the situation impossible to resolve.”
Ban called on the five permanent member states to demonstrate the solidarity and consensus they showed when negotiating Iran’s nuclear program.
8 Support Survey Results That Demonstrate Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to describe him as a wind.
Some people just think of him as a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to silence Donald Trump from the top of the support queries, it has not (now) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys in ten, Donald Trump has been leading a two-number number, and some have begun seriously considering what this means in terms of real estate coin nomination possibilities.
The election is just in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the emerging Herman Cain, no one of whom received any state back in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have noted Trump’s tenderness and began to use his funds to shut down him.
The following recent subsidy survey results indicate that the real estate king is not just a passing stage:
Trump’s popularity has made a full rule.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University’s support queries showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August the figure was 52%.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans have a positive attitude to Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures also apply in the first pre-election states.
In a survey conducted by the University of Quinnipic in Iowa last week, 60 percent of the Republicans said they are positive to Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would be either “interested” or “realised” if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “warned” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson can generate almost the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of “interested” vs Trump’s 40 percent).
What is the most exciting?
Marco Rubio is 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters would be “unhappy” or “warned” if the rulers’ favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Trump’s fireful nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and offenses, according to a Monday ABC News/Washington Post survey, 52 percent of the Republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has a proper character for the president.
According to Quinnipiac’s last week survey, the number in the first party meeting in the Iowa state is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think that Trump has a proper character to the leader.
According to the ABC/Post survey, 44 percent of people think that his character is not suitable for president, and six out of ten believe that his character is not part of the White House.
The Republicans are accustomed to this.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten found Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be appointed as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten voted for Jeb Bush.
Information disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
In the last election, at this time, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry was nominated as a candidate, and only 28 percent voted for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of the Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans would stand in favour of another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the sirpable field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as the anti-Trump support has been divided among many other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in the hypothetical bilateral battle between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christiet with 33 points each.
He’s in a row with Ted Cruise.
The only candidate to win?
If they were opposed, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump with a big 18 points difference.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters have said they’ve made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that just a little more than half of the voters in favor of Trump have decided who their vote will go.
The situation can naturally change, and no one can say with complete certainty that he will never change his mind.
46 percent said they could change their candidate.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurochirurgist Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made the decision are twice more likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants “traffickers” in his campaign initiative speech, migration has been the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are worried that Trump’s power will drive Latin voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebrand companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as migration is at the heart of matters, so is Donald Trump as well.
The frustration of the government has risen to a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson’s support now covers about half of the Republican voters, due to a large part of their position outside of politics.
Six of the ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post survey that they would prefer a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register/Bloomberg’s Iowa survey showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated with the Republicans in Congress: 54 percent were “unhappy” and 21 percent were “really angry”.
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance in Prime Minister's query
Corbyn's first appearance in the questionnaire has been excitedly expected since his election.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, met David Cameron for the first time in the Prime Minister's query.
Corbyn rises to ask about his first six questions a little after a half-day, and probably both the media and the Labour Party representatives have closely confirmed his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show “fewer theatre and more facts.”
He also said he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to take care of.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn’s leadership since he was appointed to the Shadow Government and he spoke at the Central Association’s annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to stand silent during the national song on Tuesday in the memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the British Air War, has raised criticism among the Conservative Party’s parliamentarians and has appeared in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention
Corbyn’s representative said he “stay respectfully silent” and that he recognizes “the sport of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War.”
Corbyn's Shadow Government member Owen Smith told BBC Twon Newsnight that he would have called on the Labour party leader to sing a national song despite his opinion that the royal room should be shut down.
Nearly a dozen secretaries have refused to be involved in Corbyn’s internal circle, calling for disputes in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Initially, less than a sixth of the parliamentary parties supported him as a leader.
The BBC policy exchanger Robin Brant says that the differences regarding the party’s position in the European Union and the government’s subsidy have “destroyed” even within the Labour Party after Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Central Organization of Trade Unions that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
A few hours later, the Secretary of Labour and Pension of the Shadow Government Smith said the party was “very clear” that they are only opposed to the government’s plans to lower the roof from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn becomes the fifth leader of the Labour Party that David Cameron has met in the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has “aggregated” ideas as questions to the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
The Islington North deputy Corbyn said that the nature of the Prime Minister’s queries is too contradictory and that he intends to abstain from both the narrow speech and the disturbance, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the Secretary of Finance of the Shadow Government, Angela Eagle, will act as his replacement in questionnaires when Corbyn does not participate - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to use speeches, and he has said he has approached the sub-room chairman, John Bercow, to the team of the matter.
When Cameron rose to the leadership in 2005, he said he wanted to move further from such a political theater that is often associated with the Prime Minister's query hours, but he later had to admit his failure.
Since they began to be broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questionnaire has been an important meter in assessing the leader's discretion, his sub-room management, as well as his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized the questionnaire that they have become just a picture that requires long-term reforms.
Picture in Joburg: Homeless youths are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
‘I was shot in Joburg’ is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and get profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

The price of the pound rises in Britain’s salary growth
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers seemed to rise in the UK's wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer point with SABMiller.
Between May and July, the UK’s wages, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 percent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009, and it was believed to bring estimates of increased rates.
The Punta rose over a percentage against the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84 per cent against the euro to $1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49 percent to 6229,21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock on the market and rose by 20 percent after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine two of the world’s largest brands, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9 percent after a competitive luxury group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and in addition they showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after the mining company said it had collected $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt cutting strategy.
Packaging and Paper Group Mond’s shares were the index’s largest calculators by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendations of the company to the “sale” form.
JD Sports increased by 3.1 percent after the sportswear company announced its half-year earnings before taxes: an increase of 83 percent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO says higher wages can damage the expansion
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage of employees is raised in the UK, it may mean that “the purchasing power of potential consumers is increasing.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill says.
The costs could be addressed to the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash starts a grass-ride campaign against the Aldi area penetration
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi attack in South and West Australia.
Food wholesale Metcash has launched a grass-ride campaign to defend the IGA trader’s market share in South and West Australia before Aldi’s $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and West Australia, with up to 120 stores. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food brokers and build the IGA brand through mass stream and social media marketing as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA’s merchants and buyers have jumped together, and brands like Dunsborough’s ice cream manufacturer Simmo’s offer flavours in IGA’s stores, and stores owners sell discount tickets for Australian football matches to their stores.
Metcash is expected to disclose more details of his defense strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol and rail wholesale organizes the annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and West Australia account for almost 30 percent of the area of the Metcash IGA stores, and in them the income margins are higher than in the IGA network of the Metcash eastern states.
In South and West Australia shopping, visitors are known to be corner-to-country, and IGA distributors have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 percent in the south and 24 percent in the west compared to 14 percent in the east states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will reach about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
In this week’s report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA distributors may lose $360 million in sales annually and Metcash may lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the south of 25 and in the west of 30 movements, producing $500 and $600 million turnover in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and amounts at Metcash's high fixed expenditure base can cost Metcash about $13 million for business profits before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016; 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, the leading investment fund manager and Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash could “very likely lose in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass’ comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash government would have contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA’s market share has declined from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and the revenue from Metcash’s food and food business, which transmits products to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has declined by 43 percent since 2012.
The wholesale, however, has invested more than $150 million annually in decreasing the prices of hundreds of products to the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers repair shops by adding faster growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that pricing and improving stores have increased the attraction, and he hopes that the wholesale will return to the road to profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian tennis union chairman Steve Healy supports Thanas Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honour than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered side by side in the recent storm that has broke around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says Australian tennis union chairman Steve Healy.
The younger member of the talented twin called “Special Ks” Kokkinakis was accidentally revealed in a case in which Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after that, in the Cincinnati carnival, the chief judge had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared: “Wawrinkan should have stolen Kyrgios, and I should stolen that stolen.”
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking down after the cramp broke down his potential victory against Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis’ impeccable defense.
He is now competing in Glasgow with Sam Groth from the second place in a double match with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
“I’m quite strongly convinced that Thanasi is just pulled into his explosion,” Healy said.
He broke his mole by losing a cramp because of the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mole when frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved greatly well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves bodies.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little strictly.
He’s very mature at the age of 19, he’s working hard, he’s fit with the team and so on, and he’s never had any problems with other players. He’s appreciated in the dressroom, he’s striking, he’s in good condition and he’s a pretty quiet and mature young man, and I think he should be assessed according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgyzstan in the important matches starting on Friday by describing this “common decision” as a good solution for all, but it still supports the Canberra return to the team’s permanent board.
“We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not on all the polemics around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as for example Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves everything he has received by criticism. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it will be best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public thinking about these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared an exceptional state and closed its southern border against Serbia by holding those who tried to enter the country illegally.
The border followed chaos as hundreds of migrants gathered in the unpartial area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with a turmoil.
People who escaped from the violence in their homeland have now built their tents and set up for an indefinite time on the road gap between the inspection stations of the two countries.
The frustration increased.
When the police helicopter stood above them, the immigrants shouted “Open the border!” and cried off violations to the Hungarian police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
Serbia’s foreign ministry said it is “impossible to accept” the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more arrives from Macedonia and Greece.
“(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
The discussions will take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion on the border between Hungary and Serbia arose after the 28-nation group failed in the nature of a joint immigration policy meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers who now have dominated Italy and Greece. the ministers spoke hopefully about the conclusion of a final agreement - next month or by the end of the next year - on which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will call for an additional EU summit on Tuesday to discuss the country's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbors or Brussels will act in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases could be accelerated.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the hill on the Serbian border is ready, the country also intends to set the hill on part of its anti-Romanian border in order to stop the flood of migrants through the country.
Charlie D’Agata, a letter exchange for CBS News, that even prisoners had been drawn up to finish the match between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and destination for European Union refugees, many of whom are fighting from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that the majority of the arriving are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not the underwar refugees who are eligible for protection - this view is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 feet) square hole built by the government on the anti-Serbia southern border, and include longer prison penalties for sentenced human traffickers.
“As a result of the mass immigration situation, the Hungarian government declares an emergency state,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: Crossing the illegal border is a crime.
The Parliament still has to formally approve the military positioning expected for the next week, but Associated Press’ journalists on the border have seen for days heavy-armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs.
Orban’s domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had arrested 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, as well as 15 people already in the country.
They went over by hurting the hall, are now detained by the police, and are accused of violations defined in the new laws.
The authorities are repairing the plot quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossroads on the border with Serbia after they had sent a railroad covered by a fence to close one of these places.
The main crossroads near Hungary's Roszkea was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metallic container for human handling and the crowds tried to penetrate.
Around 20 people entered, but thousands remained outside.
A group of migrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they will refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership to Bernie Sanders has dropped on the side
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues in two-number leadership in the Democratic Nomination Box, but Senator Bernie Sanders arrests him.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the Democratic voters (58 per cent), and the second Sanders is supported by 27 per cent (17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will go to the presidential election, but he is supported by 15 percent of the Democratic voters.
More than five months before the pre-election begins, the majority of Democrats say it is still too early to say they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choice more rigorously than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined among several population groups last month after a CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in the leadership of women and moderates, but her leadership has been reduced.
His popularity among men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's front route in the circles of democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and he is now on the level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly the leader among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double number among liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage points.
Approximately half of the country’s democratic voters say they are enthusiastically supporting Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says he’s supporting him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he’s a candidate.
6 percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic about supporting him.
The opinions are more confusing with those who are currently not in favor of Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
Where 48 percent of the Democratic voters say they will support Clinton enthusiastically, the Republican first-man Donald Trump says the same by a few Republican voters (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the appropriate experience (16 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his contact with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the Vice-President affects the potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democrats would like to see him already in the election – even if a third is unlike.
Asking the Democrats who they would choose for the second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the candidacy of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden leaves, the leadership will be 20 percent points, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of voters think Clinton has the best chances of winning the presidential election, but this figure has dropped from 78% last month.
With this measurement, Biden remains far away, but the percentage of those who consider him the most voting has increased.
When the Democratic voters were asked what’s most important in the candidate, however, they raised their opinions ahead of voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered impossible to be a candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates succeed well in certain key roles among their party voters.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden tries best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30 percent of Democrats say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agreeing.
When we look at all these aspects, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Though the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and server as a Foreign Minister still raises questions, most Democrat voters are pleased with her explanation and say that it didn’t affect their general opinion about her.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
People’s opinions divided in March shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the e-mail polemics did not affect their overall self-righteousness about Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion about him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion about Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton’s own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and trustworthy, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62 percent of registered voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of all registered voters in the country don’t think Trump is honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six undergraduates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many don’t have an opinion about him, just like not about Carson.
The error margin in the survey, which included 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national questionnaire
Ben Carson is coming close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
In the new survey, two candidates gathered half of all votes, leaving the other to fight for the foot.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly supporting Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the CBS’s previous survey, before Fox News’s last month’s election delay, to 27% of the Tuesday’s survey.
Carson increased from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson works well among the different demographic groups and is excluding Trump among the highly trained Republican voters.
The rest of the field has left behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen most: last month from 10 percent to current 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are on the third place with 6 percent.
The error margin for the 376 Republican voters in this latest survey in September is +/- 6 percent.
A recent survey by CNN/ORC last week showed that Carson is up in the survey: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is 32 percent ahead of him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticized retired neurochirurgy for useless, although Carso apologized for Trump's questioning faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday at a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch College's first year student
Nearly two years after the student died at a brotherhood simput ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area, Pennsylvania, the murder charges have been raised against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the Baruch College University in New York City cruelty approached Chun “Michael” Deng during the membership strike in September 2013, and then delayed his departure to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say Deng's eyes were bound and his back was loaded with more than 13 kilograms of hole filled with sand, after which he was repeatedly dragged into the ground as he tried to walk around the ice field towards the paint.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members did not call the emergency number when Deng was twisted, but according to the accusations, they waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, to search online for information about his symptoms, and to contact the national chairman of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng,” said police chief Wagner.
Dengue was not allowed to work, and he died the next morning.
According to the body opening protocol, Deng received repeated attacks of boring object on the head, body, and on the roads.
“There are too many families that have suffered from fraternity, since at least one student has died annually since 1970,” Doug Fierberg, a Deng family representative lawyer, said in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must take responsibility, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County's large jury team claimed that the first five members were charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent scratching and criminal scratching.
“We don’t want to take responsibility only by individuals; if there is an organization behind the event that has officially or informally accepted the situation, they must also take responsibility,” Wagner said on Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood broke out their contact with the local department.
This happens when the U.S. Central Bank raises interest rates.
The interest rate will rise, and the markets of rising rates will fall, the revenue of large bonds will rise, and the economy will have to decline.
This we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will last or how long it will last.
The past hardly helps in terms of timing, which comes specifically to the economy.
The repression has lasted only 11 months after the first rise, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. Central Bank in raising interest has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That’s why the U.S. Central Bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are beginning to rise, but primarily on the development cycle that goes to normalize the situation.
There are a number of variables in the equation.
At the end, however, market participants can find that all the currencies related to the interest rate have been exaggerated.
“The central bank’s first increase after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to the end of the ‘dull money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, the final economy expert in global affairs at Capital Economics in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, although still low, to the level will be such a mutant shock that many feel scared.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effects.
Here is an overview of how some aspects of the economy will react based on previous developments:
As the market has seen over the past about a month, waiting for a rise of interest can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the impact is not so dramatic.
“It seems that capital revenue tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first rise, which potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey of what will happen after the central bank’s rise.
More specifically, in the last about 35 years, the markets are generally strong, about 14 percent up when approached the rise, 250 days after that the situation is quite stable (the average rise of 2.6 percent), and the normal state has been achieved 500 days after the average yield in the six last cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the leading capital strategist of Nuveen Asset Management, published in the Barron's newspaper.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually clearer in the later stage of the rise cycle, when the revenue begins to decline.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that have not previously occurred, and which can accelerate the recession.
This is the GDP, which will be closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP of 118 increases since 1950 was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the figure in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few believe it will remain, with the third quarter advanced by 1.5 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
A rise in the interest rates in such a fragile budget can be risky and raise the question of “will this time be different,” the Deutsche Bank said.
Market parties are prepared for the central bank’s increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the committee can approve an increase at this meeting, futures trade predicts only a 25% probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all of the rise cycles have so far occurred in increasing cylindrical hypercycles, where the GDP has passed its pre-recessive heights very quickly after the recovery has begun,” the report says.
On the contrary, there has been an exceptional slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has overwhelmingly expected the longest time since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is running for 74 months.
The fixed profit has also been unstable in the markets waiting for a interest rate, and the model resembles some of the capital observations made.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its line, its effects appear faster on bonds than on shares.
The turn of debt revenue appears to change immediately with the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the rise cycle, debt revenue will decline immediately,” Deutche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise of interest causes a convergence of long-term and short-term debt revenue, thus balancing the revenue gap.
High-performance bonds often produce better in such a situation, although “we’re still cautious about finding a profit,” said Kathy Jones, Schwab’s fixed-performance analyst, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the central bank’s linear expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, there are a number of signs that the markets have adapted to the stricter monetary policy prospects,” he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the yield gap is more stable, the credit margin has increased and the instability has increased - all of this is characteristic of the market when the central bank has strengthened its orientation.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are getting worse as the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have funding.
“History shows that ‘quality’ shares are generally more profitable in three months after the first interest rate,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer-oriented report.
Companies with strong turnover exceeded underlying turnover companies after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital yield and low volatility shares performed better than low-quality companies. The average of the first mentioned was 4 (percentage points) and the last 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
The companies with a lot of variable interest debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the stock exchange, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also get profits with greater profits, although experts disagree about how fast the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of “population cleansing”
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they just traveled to the Brit Awards.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins criticizes The Voice saying it’s not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming” into Classic FM, says the leading MP adding the production company’s pressure to prove that it does something that commercial production companies don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC’s leaders that the public service radio channel influenced its “population” content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
“It seems like Radio 3 – I don’t want to use the term ‘populating’ – is moving into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards award gallery, which was launched in December last year.
“The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, only affects the Brit Awards gallery organized under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples I remember directly when you actually just copy something that’s already available on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive denied the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor in terms of live music and information sharing with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
“In addition, I think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that the channel needs to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only part of the BBC’s offer that was criticized by the commercial competitors for entering the foot during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Conservative Tory party deputy Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music contest that the BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and is not in any way unique?
Lordi Hall argued that this BBC1 show, in which the star judges are Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced “in the style of the BBC.”
He added that he wants the manufacturing company “to find success from within his own house” the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to block the production of the future The Voice seasons, or to prescribe that the money of the authorizers would be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales have risen to the lowest in August, Black Friday may be the cause
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was a rise was the lowest since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales strengthened the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday could reduce consumption
The business of virtual shopping has grown dramatically over a decade and has transformed many of the UK shopping stations into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are now signs of a balancing of online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7 percent increase for the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption in August increased the lowest since the start of statistics in 2000: only five percent from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a balancing of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7 percent increase for the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth levels of the previous years and go back to the year 2000, it would be clear that the situation would improve over time,” Andy Mulcahy, JMRG sales index reporter, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales strengthened when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people did shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as even on the sofa.
But now it is balanced, and (growth) can decrease.
Black Friday is one of the reasons for slowing trade.
Experts believe that consumers will relieve the making of purchases before the event on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average of five times the number of buyers barreled their computers to click on the stores by scratching the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to dispute about the findings, could hinder the action of purchases.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds were used online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made in online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on the shopping streets.
Muslims buried the dead in Mekka crash, sanctions for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially accused Saudi Binladin Group of building waste collapse
According to the Ministry of Health, a total of 394 people were injured in the collapse.
29 the dead were carried in the air across the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered to buri them.
Mostly in white clothes, the Syrians filled the route in honor of the first of the dead who made their last trip to the funeral of Al-Moaissem.
A sad walk passed through the holy place, where just a few days ago a river fell through the roof of the mosque and dropped the servants.
The bodies were released to be buried after the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family's fault to the building group, which also wounded 394 people.
The 29 bodies of the slave killed by the falling lifts in the Great Mosque of Mekka were carried across the streets.
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton from the Manchester area. He was in his first pilgrimage when the lifting corner collapsed.
Akram had been on a great mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already sworn that the disruption of Mekka will continue when thousands of people come to the city.
Today King Salman said that Binladin Group shouldn’t have left the boiler up when it wasn’t in use.
In the Arabic version of the decision published by the state-led Saudi Press Agency, it was said that Binladin Group is partially the cause of the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's managers were prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the collapse of the elevation churches at the Grand Mosque's yard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage that would be held later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any reports about the collapse of the law, and its representatives have not been arrested for comments.
The Royal Decision also accused the association of not using the up-to-date protective measures and of not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifts around the Great Mosque of Mekka, which are part of the huge construction work led by Binladin Group.
Bin Laden’s family has been close to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, and it leads large construction projects.
Al-Qaeda’s deceased leader Osama bin Laden was a rebellion boy who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in wind and rain weather only days before millions arrived in the kingdom for a pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim should do at least once in his life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still hospitalized.
The authorities ordered a million rial (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q says Eastern European low-cost workers are behind popularity
The UK is increasingly using assistant services, says Veronique Laury
The number of workers in Eastern Europe is rising.
As a result, more 200 Screwfix stores are opened for professionals.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's main letter exchange for Daily Mail
The British are told to give up their basars and paint pensels and to hire more skilled Eastern European workers to do household work.
It seems that if you’re thick with a vasar or thick to paint the walls, you’re currently in a minority.
You can see that the British are hiring more and more assistants to take care of the work they do in their homes, says the company’s boss behind B&Q.
Kingfisher’s new CEO, Veronique Laury, said the popularity behind the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a low price.
This leads to Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for employees and to close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wanted more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in the stores were made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
She said that the changes in the population need to be taken into account: today there are more one-woman economies where more household work is done than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to seek a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of products are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women leading the UK's FTSE100 index's leading companies. She has rebuilt her management team so that it has equally many male and female men.
Kingfisher is the only company in the group with just 50 percent of women, including its CEO and financial director.
Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important thing here.
It was not difficult to find good women in the leadership.”
Kingfisher announced a decrease in both six-year revenues and sales after the group took down the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, the owner of Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores.
The government of the three axes decided to resort to compulsory legislation to save the country’s economy.
The effects were seen quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other wage recipients center organizations began to force the same way and as a result, the country stood on Friday due to a large demonstration by workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
The question is whether it is worth the strike if it goes badly.
A resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people on the internet have already announced that they are not planning to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In a good old time, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring a corrupt would have been a political suicide of a small man.
Millions of members of professional organizations with a few tens of thousands of people protest not a lot of moment, but the reason of thinking it gives.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was a couple of years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement for themselves, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the action of the Ay movement, the government’s limited solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
After years have shown things to rule on their own weight, then now, finally, in the alliances, the matter is reached, i.e. the rights of the worker to defend, visible and properly.
The government could thus want to possibly suspend the role of the Ay movement, when membership in the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
No matter what the organizations think about the action, it’s a shit that Friday’s demonstration will somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has decreased for 31 months in a row.
GDP continues to decrease and unemployment increases.
I think that would force everyone’s head.
To the University of Lappeenranna a hard savings curve: With the goal of 8,5 million savings, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenrana is launching a savings curriculum, which aims to get the costs covered by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start the entire staff on YT negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reduction of about 130 employees.
The rest of the work is to save more than 2 million.
The YT negotiations are on the background of the 2016 budget, which forecasts the actual activity to be a deficit of 8.5 million.
This also affects the government’s funds.
During this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
The expenditure will grow slightly for the next year, but the funding from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and the rest of the funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university’s total budget is approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10 percent of the total budget.
The interaction between the massive cuts on teaching and research and the decrease in corporate funding in our university is extremely significant, says Professor Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding appears in new dimensions.
The negotiations with trust men will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Onnibus wants Finnish railways
Onnibus’s owner, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Ylle that the company is also aimed at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in the Finnish railway transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
Railways are open to competition gradually.
The first is the near-city transportation of the capital region in the years 2017-2018.
After the distance, there is distant transportation.
Souter says he has already approached the transport ministry.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Onnibus plans are welcomed.
Other international companies have their interests in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which has both bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank has to make interest rates.
The rest of the world follows the page when the U.S. Central Bank meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
In a Reuters survey of 80 economists, a little more than half of those who believed the central bank would raise the interest rates last week now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0,25 percent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the central bank played the interest rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of the zero level and start the normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought billions of dollars into balance sheets and created a low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less pink global prospects.
It has warned the markets that they should be ready to rise, but the signs indicate that they also believe that the chances are against the rise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
The Delta State University shooter sent an apology message
After shooting her girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting her colleague later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he’s “ regretted” for the first murder and hoped “that it could be withdrawn,” the authorities said on Tuesday.
The police in Mississippi Gautier that the teacher of geography and social sciences at the Delta State University, Lamb, called the emergency number around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send constables to his home.
He said “his partner to his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “does not bother anyone”, but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for the name, but he did not tell it.
Lamb did not give any explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived there, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found and the 45-year-old Lamb wrote: “I’m so sorry I hope I can cancel it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt, before he eventually killed himself late on Monday when the police surrounded him.
William LaForge, director of the university, said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt as he knew, but that “clarely Lamb had something in mind.”
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite Monday's allegations that Lamb would have believed Prentis was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "law information or evidence" of any kind of "three-drama".
Shawn O’Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a “good man.”
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was “shocked.”
O’Steen said Prentiss and his daughter were “the best friends ever.”
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked out at home by hand online. according to Sun Herald, Knowles was Prentiss' close friend.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been with Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
The police said Lamb had called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that “he will not go to prison.”
When the police reached Lamb's Voltaire 1 near Greenville later the same night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and went to run into the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb discussed the educational science of the Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to the University’s website.
The Stars Who Lost Their Attraction
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been harsh in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drugs problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug holding.
All of this really requires your tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to double break
Luke Shaw got a double break in his right foot when Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defense man was left in tears and was out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play in this season.
Héctor Moreno was caused by a hurt in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had dropped into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has a double break in his leg and he’s now in hospital.”
He will be transferred tomorrow or a day afterwards, and then cut in Manchester.
The son comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays great, and now it’s so.
When I was in the dressing room, she had an acid bar on her.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but the double break takes at least half a year, and he doesn’t play in the block stage.
I hope he will be able to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got either a red card and a punishment shot.
The judge Nicola Rizzoli has not sentenced a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian journalist was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it was a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a very bad two-foot stick.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I’m back stronger.”
Manchester United suffers Luke Shaw's case and loses PSV
The English defence team will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France in June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: “It’s really a bad injury.”
If a player gets out because of such a injury, everyone will be very sad.
The goal of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreno's foot broke when he played in the Mexican team Van Gaal against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this hard because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I did not see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed as if he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's hole.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel terrible for this, I’m so sorry.”
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling was challenged.
Did David Cameron know Lorax better?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves something in the book, it will not last a long time until it is almost learned from the outside.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When a vacation child care service asked the prime minister for his favorite book, he chose Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website and continues: “Happy, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always feels like a picture or message that we have not seen before.”
All this is true, but the next piece, in which Cameron is likely to describe the book's line, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which a fairly short original text was filled with new characters and details.
“In the city of Tarville inside the mountains, where all nature has been lost and even air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams on the side of the girl’s heart by filling Audrey’s desire to see the real tree,” the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss, the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not write.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the Lorax film plot from the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: "In the city of Needle inside the mountains, where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams for the heart of the Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the book drinking. In that young, unnamed boy hears how the local nature has destroyed the appetite, the trees stumbling and would need a corner Kerskanen, without giving the story a name to the short, wise being of Lorax, who “speaks for the trees.”
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably externalized to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row for the child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text was probably from the Cameron District office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on the matter at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being left behind the English team, but it was still a hard place.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think the last 3-0 series mistake is likely to be repeated.
I would not exclude the guest out of the bills.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it involves good cyclists and the team's way of thinking is strong: they don't have a draw from 2012, only young positive.
Moeen Ali develops in his rolling work and Adil Rashid is an aggressive option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Adam Lyth dropped from the English cricket team, Alex Hales replaced him
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his chief coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but bitter truth is that cricket players are criticized on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the choice of Joe Root before the information, because, as I have said before, players are the best choices.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come ahead.
England's chief coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't work as well as he could, and it didn't surprise me.
It’s difficult to answer the question how long the shooter gets to leave traces.
Lyth was elected seven times, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play both at home and in guests.
The only subject of the complaint is that the English first chose Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but that lost chance is now the past.
Alex Hales comes with, and there is a shot that I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this really depends on the team’s composition in the United Arab Emirates.
There has been the idea of Moeen in the strike at Cook, allowing an extra entrance to the field but holding four fasts, and I am not against it.
I don’t understand why the shooters could not be hit there, and this leftist has already shown to be a pretty cricket player.
Moe didn’t necessarily do his job in his countryside in Worcestershire, but he’s for them three and there’s little difference in it.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games at the first fall of the hill before moving to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points and didn’t remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a reserve manager in the team, and, as little as I have been doing with him, he feels very impressive as a young man.
People can look at his undecorated statistics - hit the average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think it's a gambling, but there's not too many input and voters chose the young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Out of the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games can prove to be an intrusion.
He is one of the most comfortable guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience, because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood takes part in the White Ball games, bringing both energy and untouchable loss.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in the international cricket, whether it’s playing or training, and he has the same genus to exploit as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressroom can restore the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team player from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I don't have any problems with it at least.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the chosen do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
Those who are interested in Brexit can make a profit if the UK’s economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s mid-deal re-deal strategies to keep Britain in the EU are faced with ever-growing problems, even if not taken into account even the heartbreaking Jeremy “Is it yes or not?” Corbyn’s election to lead the Labour Party or the Central Organization of Trade Unions’ invasion to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that because the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, not all of which are its own cause, some Member States are tired of the British self-oriented agenda, filled with disagreements and disturbing treaty changes that these states do not desire mostly.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organization of Trade Unions decided that they would not even want them if they steal their social protection.
We could even call it a selfie agent of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance delay the summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local prospective, and then come home saying they win the supporters of reforms.
Everything is about me.
My European friend, who wants to look from the outside to the UK’s EU tent – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says – suggests that the shortest-looking ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at such a point that they don’t care we’ll leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to give up its action before it goes down in the same way as it happened to too long delayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francois Hollande is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a destroyed power.
Poland may soon be a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing.
It is difficult to see these countries being sacrificed for self-britts, when their energy should be more focused on preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom – they don’t want it either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of such ministers may even plan to make consciously useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process.
“The new negotiations were a matter,” and “the new negotiations had no importance for Britain.”
Europeans have had a tremendous experience of how astonishing the Fleet Street newspaper can be and how EU-skeptic press monarchs are, what they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed by the ratio of 2:1.
They can blindly remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who named himself by writing “On the EU’s direct bananas” when he was a Brussels letter exchange in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband was a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a listing set of tax-outsiders, foreigners hacking phones, as well as people whose home is namely elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought about them exactly the same thing, but realized that if you’re in a hole with a humble gorilla, you’ll have to give up the bananas because of the spider, unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later even at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blair than Blair himself, as it comes to opposition to Cameron's re-deals. Bair had indeed admitted the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgived him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gently killed me back in the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste on me), would seem to be at risk of re-accepting Neil Kinnock's 80s boycotted Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not to me, but undoubtedly to Andrew Marri, whom the BBC supporter Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position in Europe is, in a beautiful way, developing.
He says he wants us to remain in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of the people outside the UK Independence Party of Ukip’s war-male and the conservative party’s most wicked nationalists can surely stand behind this opinion.
Hilary “Benn, but not Benn-Fan,” Benn said so on both radio and television this week, when his internal party fellow would have wanted to admit that Corbyn’s choice to appoint John McDonnell as the Secretary of Finance of the Shadow Government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-father appeared on television trying to be unfaithful to the Labour Party’s government colleagues without going so far that he lost his government.
Hilary's surfaces were more attractive.
But for the struggle to stay involved “in any situation” – Benn’s statement – was not what McDonnell said, and not the conclusion of what Corbyn told the main roads and MPs at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the unhierarcal, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to transmit ( remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of night-to-night television, and especially in the rounds of social media, which is a suitable growth platform for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell said, it’s just fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the Labour Party’s support in the referendum campaign clear of itself.
Simon Jenkins thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental cycle of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-minded regulated economics and their anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among solitary thinkers for whom narcissism of small differences is a key dogma in educational fighting.
As for his doubts in relation to NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby will not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their leaders.
Why would Paris or Berlin be worth spending political capital (they also have unbelievable voters) on granting to Britain, when it can be completely useless?
The U.S. has already somewhat disappointed with the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England's E-Tobacco Review
Scientists have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes came from a meeting of 12 people, part of which had connections with the tobacco industry.
Experts writing to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) to criticize Lancet in their report on electric tobacco.
The PHE published this “crowdfund” report last month describing it as “a comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to the contacts between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Medical Journal, Lancet, published a paper last month that attacked the PHE’s decision on the “extraordinary Huthera basis.”
Two other scientists in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were “built on rock or on sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that the practices must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public will expect that the PHE’s claim “the current best assessment suggests that electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes” is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one 12-person meeting in which a multi-criterial decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions about the harm that is combined with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were aggregated to the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive is to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health responsibilities in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 people on the meeting said they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for the selection of the panel members are not stated, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of whom also say they have received funding from the field in the study.
Others who were on the site are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the CBS Director.
The group’s study “multy-speakingly acknowledges” that there is a lack of “unquestionable evidence of disadvantages in most of the products and most of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell write.
However, no of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “for now there is no evidence that electric tobacco works as a route for smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, says the claims made in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, “Electric cigarettes are much less harmful than burning.”
Half of those who burn their lives die from their dependence.
All evidence indicates that the health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public unconsciousness compared to relative dangers with tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs NHS £2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though electrical cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are just a fragment of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we meet our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 Chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would “do anything” about such hits as the soap series on the Albert Square Street.
Johnson said the authorisation fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters do not do.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-service programs that are likely to have a smaller audience, challenging broadcast times against competitors’ most viewed programs and channels such as the BBC4.
After BBC’s CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to make more cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said that he had spent the time of Channel 4 for six years to establish relationships with BBC, in vain.
“I don’t understand the idea that the BBC is producing and broadcasting programs that are clearly suitable for non-subsidized competitors,” Johnson told the Supreme Chamber Communications Committee as part of its BBC’s research on the future.
If the permission fee is held - I’m not sure it would be a good idea for this message or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others don’t do and do.
The Voice will be sent to the most important time of broadcast because it is intended to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else will show the program is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s clearly stupid.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why regressive tax should be funded by programs that could be funded even without government support.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders the other, without prohibition inside the house carried out.
In other words, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don’t understand what it is about public service.
I don’t think that would undermine the BBC at all.”
Johnson, the director of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting the audience “for the goals of the people who work there and because they believe it is the best way to long-term support.”
He commented on the BBC's most popular series reminding the comments of former Sky director Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC’s smaller public service programs “go to the BBC4, where the number of viewers is often not measured, but the BBC thus fills its responsibility and can then, by defending the $4 billion licensing revenue, strongly say, ‘we are doing all of these unknown programs that no one is watching.’”
They put them in a broadcast place where no one will ever come to see them.
Johnson told the committee: “I challenge you to find a more regressive system in which one receives the most compensation.
Yes, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds per year get a lot of exchange, but I don't know if it's true for those people who have a lot of money for 150 pounds because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith's task of "communicating, training and entertaining."
He said that only a small part of BBC’s production is currently classified as education – he said the numbers are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio – and that it should take a model from Australian and Canadian broadcasts and change the task into a form of “communicating, illuminating and entertaining.”
As for partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he says are showed on television only by rivers, and associate with commercial companies in such a way that all of them can be viewed online.
“Sound Genetics” enables brain cells to control through sound waves
The video shows how the wheels change direction as soon as the sound-impulse hits them.
The researchers have grown mates with genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound outbreaks.
The small shoulder walls change their direction as soon as they are hit by a sound-impulse that is too high to be heard by the human body.
The impulses operate by connecting genetically modified muscle cells with cell channels reacting to ultrasound valves.
Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that the frogs show the functionality of a new method, called soundgenetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body by hand.
A researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, Sreekanth Chalasani told The Guardian that the method may one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which people's brains are driven by electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
The bulbs normally do not react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani noticed that when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened the ultrasound valves, which then passed into the mates.
Strengthened ultraviolet waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures that are in the cell membranes of some mates.
The sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled sculptures, Chalasani genetically modified the sculptures so that some of their movement cells contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified patches, the microwave strengthened the sound valves and transmitted them to patches where they connected the modified movement cells.
The method has some of the same features as in optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to connect the nerve cells up and out using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to send optical fiber along the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultraviolet waves can pass through the tissue uninterruptedly, so they can be sent to the brain from the cornea.
“We believe that using genotherapy and therapeutic virus can be possible to get the targeted human nerve cells instantly react to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and cells that produce insulin, he added.

Advertisements Can Make Britain's Arms Trade Shame
Watch Amnesty International’s video.
The terrible killers.
Dirty pedestrian cars!
The Firefighters!
Both electrical drilling pumps that cause pain but do not leave any traces!
The pleasant voice and cartoon image language leave no doubt that this advertisement of the world’s largest positions is an sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to emphasize the British government’s willingness to trade weapons to the pressure governments of Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Center in London’s Bay Area.
DSEI's Positions: Authoritarian Governments Arrive in London
With a separate campaign, many publications appeared on bus stops and metro stations, requiring more detailed knowledge.
“An important information, Do you travel on the DLR route on 15-18 September?” is asked by using the underground font and brand in London, when the DLR route is transformed into a tank image.
This September, a lot of weapons dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the stations.
These 300 statements are made by the artists whose works were presented at the Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped spread advertisements around London using the “Ad Space Hack Packs” packages. This is a six-pond package of six-cold keys, which, according to the collective, “capes a third of the advertising status of the entire planet’s bus stops.”
Transport for London has not been interested in this unauthorized “public vandalism.”
One of the parodi names produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and Dr. Gavin Grindon at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioned and want to bring political work to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists have begun to work with activists on the opposition fronts when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another anti-armament declaration welcomes workers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed via Facebook over the last 24 hours more than 100,000 times. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also the graphic designer and background creator worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin noticed that positions were not advertised at all – and there was also a empty point in the ExCeL calendar at that time – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of more realistic advertising of the obscure corporation, but “there was more enduring to emphasize the matter with bright colors and animation.”
“They’ve done a fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture that is sold at the exhibitions,” Amnesty’s Tom Davies says.
Now the UK government has to take action and ensure that torture tools are not illegally sold near our own home.
Per the most creative art in relation to stations comes from the inside of ExCeL, when exhibitors trade fantasticly decorated products.
Saab revealed in a press release that he received an order from the U.S. Army of “third-hand AT4CS RS.”
This includes a “unicity pipe-pumping pipe that targets excellent effects on the back of the pansar inside the object.”
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Housing
11 years have passed since when I was unknown at the age of 19, I moved to a student-residence law. Then I still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the violent smile of people I irritated - and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Most of my learning can be comprised into eight simple rules.
Changing to a home loan can be anything that goes to the nerves to completely scary.
It’s attractive to tell you where you’re from, where you like the middle year and where you think about Corbyn, and why “I seriously don’t love or hate Marmitea because it’s really just an output HAHAHA I find in my room.”
Take the breath.
And also help others attract the spirit - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find those people you like and not those you don’t want to talk to even if your eyeglasses are in fire and they will share the shutters.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often transformed into cocktails, leaflets and common time places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Don’t even imagine starting a college when you’re in a relationship.
The university is a hard place for introverts.
Your room should be a place of rest, but many apartments form a culture of walking from room to room, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendship.
It can mean hell for someone who is trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you the promise to say, “I love you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to go now, so that I can gather back the energy I spent talking with you.”
Try to feel when the student's coupon is tired of socialization - and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When it comes to the word: knock.
One type in my student residence thought that if the door was not locked, he was called in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through food.
As you start the university at the peak season, knocking people at the doors with a chocolate plate and presenting yourself appears to some extent less strange, less “ welcome to the neighborhood, I’ve baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions” from the 50’s reader.
Providing self-made flavours is a great way to get friends.
Your partner will feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will connect your face to a delicious surprise.
It depends on whether you know how to eat.
The poorly mixed powder-sugar-fatty disorders are likely to cause people to just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Theft of food is a common crime in student housing conditions.
Comprehensibly, bringing someone out of chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a bit of milk to your tea?
Ask and check the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stories, it’s annoying and you’ll get my sympathy – but try to treat it more adult than my household friend who mixed their milk with a washing machine to punish those who steal it.
He is now in prison.
You will not be shy so that people are not allowed to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you’re like that speech steering the cage.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbor if they could play drum and bass music more quietly because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at five in the morning, the girl gently allowed them to sleep for two hours before putting her own music out, locked her doors and went to a three-hour test.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would change the same house with you?
Or, vice versa, would it not be incredibly tempting if you regard the housing partner as your future spouse, you would collide, divorce, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot housing partner isn’t your future spouse, you might even try to speak the sense on your bottom.
In the pleasant moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the boundary between scratching and temptation is thinner than what it looks like.
A good puppy is fun, but can be withdrawn in a moment.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never confuse someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their doors and tap the keys into the water glass, which you then put in the freezer - but don't attach their property with a blue cylinder to the roof as much as twice.
A racial attack on a residence of foreign students in Kite - a house planned as a reception center was destroyed in Salossa
A terrorist attack on the residence of foreign students took place on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karjala.
Unlike the police previously said, it is not the accommodation of minors asylum seekers but the bedroom of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical People's University of Kiteen.
The windows and walls of the university’s accommodations were scattered with racist signs, such as hackers, and a metal object was thrown through the one accommodation window, the police said in a statement.
According to Luukkaisen, who serves as a responsive teacher of the National University’s youth social security-training, the building, which was the subject of primacy, was estimated to be ten people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
The National University has accommodated people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Every one in the building has a statue.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are in professional studies and some are studying in Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is the so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police investigate the attack as a damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, the event was held for students on Monday an informational conference, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We have been with foreign students for twenty years, and this is the first time something like this happens,” Luukkainen says.
According to the police, the walls have already been cleaned.
According to the report, there were at least three men who had been on the road in a car.
I think this is the main end of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
There’s nothing more serious than that,” he says.
There is also a hospital in Salossa, where a reception center is designed.
The incident happened last week.
This was on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The walls of the hospital were drawn with a hack and written "You are not welcome" in English.
A criminal report has been made to the police.
Updated 15.9.16.02 Corrected the erroneous information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state stops the Y train to the Bear - passengers in their arms, "very stupid"
The Y-boat that runs from Helsinki to Raasepor Karja will cease to run in March.
The news annoyed the passengers riding to the start of the train at the Helsinki main railway station.
Especially the downside strikes the blessed people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the town.
It’s very stupid because the population is growing and workers need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can not depend on anything but on political will – or its lack.
Bengtström says in HSTV’s interview video they’re coming even with a tractor to the capital.
There are also new train changes.
The H and R trains that pass on the edge are combined into a new R line.
The station of Purola in Lake and Nuppulinna in Tuusul is out of use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced on Tuesday the information on the routes the Ministry will buy train transport in the next contract period.
The contract period changes over the course of the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be concluded in the autumn, will be approved by the monetary committee.
Bengtström believes that the state train driver is a short-looking activity.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then the compassion comes.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseporians and the Blessed, because it is fast and passes through several positions.
The Spanish Annina Pöyryä damaged the fate of those traveling further to the city area by train.
"It's a bad thing for those who have to re-planning their journey," he said while hurting the Y train.
A little relief is allowed.
The river is likely to have a new railway connection, which will replace the Y railway in the Helsinki Seudun Transportation (HSL) area, i.e. to the Church.
This brings additional costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities of the region and to their taxpayers.
“We are now going to explore the different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices,” said HSL’s CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is not possible to assess the cost accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million years, the ministry of course much more.
The R line leaves two positions.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes are stopped throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer purchases train transport on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to the Pieksämäki-Vrakus route.
The trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million roads are carried out on covered roads per year, with a total of about nine million roads in transport purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the state an annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Actuality: "Marx is worth knowing"
The global economic crises have raised up Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, Capital, published in the years 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, former Chairman of the SKP, in the book Marx's Capital Current.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his prejudice.
Marx’s estimates of the development, internationalization and infiltration of the capitalist economy in all areas of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of money and imaginary capital have turned out to be surprisingly distant.
The book, based on the Capital Seminars organized by Hakasen, is also written by Aalto University professor, valued economic participant Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current “now and forever.”
Not that the ex-Chairman of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is Marxist?
not anyway.
Korkman says in the phone that he does not consider Marx as an actual economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays, social sciences are distinctive and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary hours.
“The ordinary concept is that the story of the devil tells us about the false opinions of the dead men,” Korkman starts.
Marx’s predictions went very wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the initial stage of capitalism, Korkman thinks.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’ radical attitude.
“The most important thing in Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Now we are discussing Marx’ interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture of a world that is changing as a result of technological mutation,” Korkman says.
But what the government should decide tomorrow does not help Marx.
He believed that capitalism was an unexpected event that should only be stopped.
In the meantime, Marx should be acquainted.
“In the 1970s Marx could not read,” Korkman says.
“The Poles and the Trotsky and the other Dutch hated all capitalism, but even more one another.”
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political burden of the back years.
“Every social scientist should get acquainted with Marx’s thought world—as with other classics,” Korkman says.
United Nations calls for war criminals sentence in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls on the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Civil War in Sri Lanka, the news agency AFP said.
The report of the United Nations on the civil war from 1983 to 2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka’s armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil militants of war crimes.
The Civil War in Sri Lanka estimates that at least 100,000 people were killed.
There is no accurate information about the number of victims.
Especially the massive attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, the United Nations report requires.
The report accuses Sri Lanka’s armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been accused of forcing side and children to be fighters.
According to the report, both sides have committed the murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to organize the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN court because of foreign judges.
In the yo-test in England, social media was pointed.
In the autumn student writings on Wednesday was a long foreign language, which was mostly English.
His English skills were tested by more than 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, he could write about the subject on social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the 150-250 words in English could indicate the webmaster's consulting tape to the holder.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leeli's resting chair.
He was asked for advice on how parents should look at things as well as the youth.
There were four subjects, one of which was to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them,” said Mia Lybeck, the English doctor at the Swedish High School in Porvoo.
The third issue was just a quote by former European Commission President José Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was very good, according to Lybeck.
It had to write a fireproof, why should hire young people to work.
“Always in our school we’ve been trained to write speeches,” Lybeck says and evaluates the whole test as “might normal.”
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts, such as the adaptation of the summer camp to climate change and the processing of large masses of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn scripts will continue on Friday, when there is a second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish test.
At school, the exam is organized normally, i.e. the wage-wage demonstration does not affect it.
The Student Examination Board calls on the examiners to look for appropriate road connections in time so that they can get ready for the examination.
Additional time can also be obtained if it is possible to prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A trade with weapons is threatened
On Wednesday morning, a shop was stolen in the town of Oulu.
According to the police, the thief was dressed in dark clothes and covered his face with a command tape.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a hand weapon and received a small amount of money.
The case is investigated as a violent robbery.
Police are preparing tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support parties from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government’s cuts will be blocked by the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary data, there can be tens of thousands of people.
Members of the associations of SAK, Akava and STTK will meet at Rautatientor at 11:00 p.m.
Police are also expected to participate in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work, in turn, is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to safeguard the flow of the giant alarm.
The roads that lead to the railway station will be closed from motor vehicles for the period between 9:30 and 14:30.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
From the direction of Hakaniem, the traffic will be interrupted from the direction of Kaisaniem, from the direction of the west, from the Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people in the Helsinki police station, Deputy Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
At least so far it seems enough.
I am not concerned with police struggles.
According to Kujala, there will be support parties from other parts of Finland due to the demonstration.
The exact numbers are not told by the police.
“A lot is coming, but we’re going to do it by our own,” Kujala says.
The police urged to avoid private vehicles in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic gap will extend from the Hakaniem level to the nuclear center.
Traffic stops are expected from the morning to the morning.
With the protesters coming from other countries, there are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed to travel to the Railway Station.
Basically, the buses are far away.
We have to go to the place of the demonstration,” Kujala says.
It will also stop Helsinki’s public transportation.
This is a positive side from the policy point of view.
The problem of the smoothness of the public transport, which is normally in the hands of these large crowd meetings, is now being addressed in part by itself.
The protest organizers have told the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents to the government’s economic policy in Helsinki.
Police are waiting for the demonstration to go quietly.
There are ordinary workers or unemployed – ordinary citizens.
The Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The great demonstration held by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For this, for example, there is no very good reference from the Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University, emeritus Martti Siisetinen.
It is no wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it did not do so, it would raise the hands up in front of the government, Sisišinen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish well-being state.
The government’s struggles lack the right to contract.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is actually trying to get on your knee.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have any support from all the winners for Friday protests.
The new is the sharp division that the demonstration will make among those that the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated their mind at the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If the Friday demonstration is looking for a reference point, it could be the unemployed giant demonstration, the Murrostorstai, which was held in 1993, said.
In the middle of the deepest slam, the Murrostorstai gathered around 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (central) government compurates from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the salary organizations have never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the times of Murrostorsta.
In addition to this, there is now a very bourgeois government in the power of Finland ever, Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing despite the philosophical speeches.
Even at the time of the lightning there were certain elements of the old workers’ movement.
Thousands of protesters are expected to arrive on Friday.
It will also stop public transport and eventually close dayhouses and schools.
Unless the demonstration receives unshared support from the wage recipients, it can become the highest over the years.
Over the past few years there have been approximately 300 demonstrations annually in Helsinki.
They are fairly placed.
Traditionally, the Ay movement’s demonstrations in Finland have been quite peaceful – although the practices have strengthened in recent years.
Traditionally, protests in Finland avoid conflicts, be lawful.
The protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying the property, Siisinen says.
The late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest has changed.
The EU membership inspired farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get a pig on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also strikes among other pilots and aircraft managers.
Do you remember the strikes and protests?
The 1970s metal and electricity
The major strikes of the 1970s were the metal break in 1971 and the power and electric break in 1977.
70,000 metalmen were involved in the metalmen strike.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the Council of Reconciliation after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The employees received a 16-percent wage increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electricity break lasted 49 days and caused electrical interruptions throughout the country.
The murder in 1993
On 4 November 1993, approximately 20,000 people, many of whom became unemployed, gathered for the House of Representatives to demonstrate their opinion for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters strike was one of the longest, unless the longest national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police suffered the egg flood in a protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Cyprus teaches, the EU stops,” one of the shocks was said.
In Spain, the farmers suffered a tonne of snow.
Also, the Helsinki EU summit in 1999 led farmers to protest and burn July balls in front of the meeting site.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were striking for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been in the strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by several deaths that occurred during the strike.
The factory was threatened by the strike and the mass shooting of the nurse in 2007.
The threat of mass expulsion eventually accelerated negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors in the strike - forced," was the striking slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centers and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a vibrant debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased the salaries of doctors.
Students Moving in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for study support in Helsinki from the Senate to the House of Representatives in 2013.
Central Criminal Police Finds the Backgrounds of a Finnish Refugee Filled to the Austrian Police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the background of the refugee strike registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police arrested a hole in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is unclear whether it was possible to travel to Finland.
Everyone who was in the cold was in good condition.
We had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the place of the event in Austria, Central Criminal Police Supreme Commissioner Tero Haapala said.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in a truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers were killed in the attack.
According to General Radio, which first told about cooperation with the Austrian police, the track belongs to the Finnish shareholding company.
The company operates, among other things, restaurant activities and its chief executive is a foreigner, a 40-year-old man.
Two people have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
The Captain of Refugees, An Ex-Drug Cursor, and A Wicked Businessman: The Story of Five Traffickers
A wicked king of scammers, a violent shipwreck, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good residual.
For example, such people practice human trafficking into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, working at the University of Trento, have met and interviewed dozens of scammers and their “customers,” and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tracks of human trafficking, present solutions and present the traffickers from the different stages of the business.
HS will present five of them.
Remove them immediately.
Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go there for a summer holiday.
For its location, the islands are also suitable for trafficking, as the way to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain burning captain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their landscapes, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
It has been done by Emir with its blue, ten-metre cotton fence hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it will have a capacity of 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about €8,000 after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for him clients around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab season, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape from the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed until the refugee crisis broke again.
Guests arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as they see good.
The food is given in such a way that the customers just and just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer gets the money out, it's their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with the shutdown.
The first night is taken out of the island, then stopped, waiting for the day, and the next night drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the 20 meters high waves passengers cry and vomit.
In the end, the human body has been destroyed in half an hour and Emir is on a return trip.
Emir wants him to be afraid.
That’s why he blows his clients and at least claims he’s hunting the hunters to die.
She tells in the book that when the police once caught him, he threw all his passengers over the board and ordered them to swim on the nearest island.
"I met the customers individually from the neck and threw them over the plate," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He said that he should be abused by this.
I am going to get them away immediately.
They need to show them immediately who is determining here.
A regular taxi driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovað, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the start engine is pulling to the last, and otherwise it has seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are allowed.
In the forests surrounding the center, men who travel without their family are staying in tents, shelves and abandoned cars, what now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for a reason or for a reason, have not filed an asylum application to Serbia.
Some are also accommodated in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often run off - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in difficult landscapes, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
Finally arriving in the region of Bogova, the point of the massive human trafficking, people are deadly.
The Goran Cytes are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
“They’re saying their thing once and it’s enough,” Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to get rid of it.
Goran doesn’t like it.
The foolish foolish all the way.
First, the price is agreed, for example, 300 euros, then they drop it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes to be a nice and good-hearted man.
I am not interested in money.
I’m doing my job and I’m helping people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he’s going to do jobs cheaper than others, and he’s going to pay only 50 euros per person on the Hungarian border.
The road is three hundred kilometers, most comfortably by motorway.
They claim a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It’s not a big amount for the smugglers, but in Serbia it’s quite a nice return.
Serbia has ordered no taxis to carry migrants 12 kilometers closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and roads and takes his silk a kilometer away from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and throw away.
In the work of grace
A 35-year-old Kongo man is called the Missionary Priest, and it is not just a surname.
He actually has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Campala, where many believers flee from the Congo, as well as a small center where children refugees are assisted.
In addition to the prophecy, the Missionary priest runs on a trafficking bus, where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He is doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
She brushes her shoes several times a day and takes care that the rubber of white calcars is stylishly thrown under the low belt of the garbage.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his land car and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary Priest does not preach, he arranges people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five telephone numbers of the Missionary Priest.
He advises that it is worth arriving on the border in the morning, hiding the money in a whistle and putting it in the midst of the traders who cross the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or a refugee to the Uganda authorities, it is necessary to inform the authorities that they have come from, for example, the northern Kiev war zones and that they have been forced to escape from their homes by violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Messaging Prophet will arrange a new identity for the customer.
An old identity card is removed and another is replaced.
It helps the Missionary's contacts with the police in Uganda.
After that, the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary preacher knows the bureaucracy because he has also become a refugee in Uganda.
He calculates each stage separately: the application to the police of Uganda costs about a hundred euros, the handling of documents to a humanitarian organization about 150 euros, and the migration process, for example, to one European country, 4 500-7 000 euros.
Folio and Ice Fires
Tom is a beginner narcissist, a former narcissist.
A 40-year-old Irish man travels on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people to the trails on his way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, as well as dozens of runners who may not even know that they are a human transport business.
On the night, Tom and the taxi driver raised their client, usually 2-3 people, from some of the Calais's center.
They drive the A26 motorway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would have to organize illegal immigration directly into prison.
That's not what Tom wants, he has been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs with his clients over the motorway to a relaxation place where the chefs fall asleep before going through the channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right thread - it is to make sure that it is on the way right to England and not even to the Netherlands - and cuts around the protective gate of the security wire.
It should be done quietly so that the bosses don’t wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in the line, but then the desire is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom scratches his client into an aluminum foil, similar to the one that in the kitchen is scratched around a paste or oven.
It should prevent the police’s heat scanner from seeing the hidden.
Some use ice-filled bedbugs for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client on the trail and leaves the place hoping that the chief of staff will not rush the shipping passengers at least before Britain.
The King of Traffickers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world’s most famous human traffickers.
The Upporik Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal Mediterranean landings, ruling the maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of counterfeiting.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he requires the money only at the end.
One of the new methods is the luxury scam: Turkish ports are rented according to the entertainment fee to take U.S. or European families for a comfortable few-day tour tour.
In reality, the vessels are charged to accurately from Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghanistan, who are transported for a fee of €5,000 to €7,000 first from Istanbul to some port and from there by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until they have time to leave.
People are shut down in minibus and drive somewhere to the coast.
They are ordered to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it is necessary to rise to the ship quickly.
Passengers must keep the whole journey hidden under the carriage.
The maritime guard can only monitor the depth of the ship swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately €53,000 for one luxury ship trip after expenses.
He does not take care of the practical things himself but he employs captains, painters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to take care of the work for himself.
During the summer season, transportation will be organized at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have bought the land through cover companies, a pharmacy company and more than a hundred apartments he rented.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 simultaneously with a Turkish Democratic Party member and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that he apparently disappeared.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will appear this week, not next week.
The American Olympic Race member tells him about his illness and becoming a prostitute.
Three times competing at the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells us about ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published a breakdown of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competition in the top condition and ran in the carnival for the second best time.
In the final, he was in panic.
He ran to the top at the very beginning and defended his lead position with a land race.
150 meters before the painting, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the rail, and the other competitors crossed him one after the other.
I felt an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself beyond the painting line, says Favour Hamilton in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bilateral mood disorder.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney matches suicide, and he himself felt huge success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she began prostitution in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
He also urged his husband to accept his actions.
Favour Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favour Hamilton’s explanations about becoming a prostitute was that he sought the same adrenaline patterns as he had received when competing in public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he had a bilateral mood disorder.
The double life of the former star rider was revealed at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters world statistical peak at 3.57.40, but remained the last in the Olympic Finals in Sydney.
The world champion rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian skyscraper in the shore: "Right"
Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of suitability, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian ski association have dismissed the sports agreement as last summer and autumn.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not even won a multi-world champion and an Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the next season's World Cup.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was pleased that the alliance put the skyscraper in the shore.
“Thank you for showing your backbone,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow one active athlete to avoid working for the federation's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Alliance and Northug is a matter of money.
Northug would obviously want to be part of the season in the country team so that he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was pleased to represent the alliance, which also takes care of the future generations, and does not give one athlete on the solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I have been a part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own statement on Tuesday, in which he assured that he wants to play in the Norwegian colors in the next season in the World Cup as well as afterwards in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals, two of which were gold.
He participated in the team that won the messaging ball last winter in Falun Gong.
Translator Day is also celebrated in the North.
On the day 25th of September, bookings will be held in different restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Book of the Translators.
The aim of the day is to emphasize the high level of Finnish food expertise and to lower the threshold of departure to the restaurant, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of the shell as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are focused on the capital area, but top restaurants reviewed and classified by an unpartial operator are found throughout Finland.
The international attention obtained by the event is a demonstration of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of competing restaurants and the organization.
On the northern part of the day will be held in Vaasa a restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarelliks.
On the day of the competition there is a restaurant in the Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to become one of the most important international events of the organization, which will be held during the same day in different worlds.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki newspaper: the establishment of the Kauhava reception center was encouraged by the Chancellor of Justice
The Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception center for the Kauhava ex-armament premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still permanently a critical infrastructure in the crisis, which is in use by the defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Separate Networks Oy.
The Kauhajoki newspaper reports that, according to the individual, the placement of the reception center in the same building complex would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area of the former Airport School and its airport, the impact of which has not yet been cleared when preparing the reception center, the newspaper writes.
The report notes that over the past two years there have been negotiations on the organization of air training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator to the airport.
This has been discussed, among others, with the Minister of Defense Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and the Minister of Defense Arto Rädy.
The private person points out to the court chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of the primary objection of the reception center, but that the planned place in the former guard area is incorrect.
The local government discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Governance means that the immigrants and those who are here have the necessary circumstances, Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties in their office in Mäntyniem.
The President said the concerns about the refugee situation united all the participants.
He appreciates that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to confidentially discuss ultimate issues.
Especially when we are facing a lot of challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States on the territory may have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and consequently in the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tensions on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The issue of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.
Finnair will cancel 16 domestic flights on Friday

Finavia reports that the operations of the airports are intended to be managed by the headquarters during the operation.
However, delays and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
Protests closed streets in Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of the centre of Helsinki.
Police say the streets that lead to the Railway Station will be closed from cars around 9:30-14.
From the direction of the landmarks, cars are not allowed in the direction of Kaivokatua, Postikatua or Töölönlahdenkatua to the railway station.
From the Union Road to Hakaniem, traffic is directed to the Union Road at the Kaisaniem Traffic Area.
The deadline depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
Metro and roadside protests on Friday
Metro and train drivers will take part in the demonstration on Friday from the morning ship to the night ship.
The Railway and Metro staff association told the STT this evening.
Most of the starts are closed for two hours, including post closed.
The demonstration on Friday will also cause interference with the Post service.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of the daily mail.
Most of the service points are closed.
Blood transfers of the Red Cross in Finland are treated despite the strike.
Food transports and hospitals and laboratory samples are also aimed at treating.
Information about the services can be obtained on the Post website.

The service industry trade union Pam has instructed its employees to cease their work between 11 and 13 p.m.
Pam has also urged daily warehouse workers to participate in the professional organizations’ demonstrations.
The representatives of the SOK and the Centre tell the Helsingin Sanom that the stores are aimed at keeping open, if necessary, by the headquarters.
According to the Centre, there is no information yet about the possible closure of individual stores.
The Helsinki house is partially closed.
The Helsinki day houses do not operate fully on Friday, the Helsinki Early Education Agency reports.

All-night living rooms and groups of children with disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for developing disabled and autistic school students are organized normally.
Early education agency promises to report further changes to the activity tomorrow.
Press Release: Risk is high
According to Sipila, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio interviews are one channel among others.
This channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sibiu told reporters in the parliament.
She has not yet wanted to evaluate how often the repeated way of the Prime Minister's television and radio conversations will come.
According to Sipil, talks may not always be transmitted in the future via the Ylu channel.
If other channels are registered as a channel, then let’s look at it.
Now we are using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilé, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires the holding of a television and radio meeting for citizens.
This complexity, of which we are talking now, is quite complex and requires a longer reasoning.
That’s why we ended up on this channel.
The talk will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also see it in the area.
The Syndrome takes a great risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's television broadcast does not tell about the more general conversion of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the definition of the public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse the public debate to question questions? asks Professor Anu Koivunen at the University of Stockholm.
It comes to mind the recent comment of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not connected.
We understand that the commercial media has been angry with the announcement of Sipila.
It would be strange if the media field did not react.
The methods of communication of political decision makers are not a matter of declaration in democracy.
The task of the media representatives is to do a definite effort to ensure that the agenda of politicians is not taken as given.
He says television is a big risk.
In his speech, he should bring something new and special to the table, so that the exceptional high expectations set to the speech are met.
Is there anything else that we have heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in permission, you have to wonder why such a great action was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Generally, take this risk in the sense that it is not a specific situation, but a routine gap among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be characterized as a message from politicians or the parliament and the government, which is not in line with the interests of the Yale or the general line.
The Oval Veto
In the upcoming speech of Sipila, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher emphasizes.
The evening will be to look carefully where Sipilä lacks and where not, says the research coordinator of Jyväskylä University Heikki Kuutti.
According to Kuut, the television speech is from Siberia an oval veto, because thus this man can bring his own view to the expression without sounding.
This makes the message a large audience without a journalist filter, unlike a news event where journalists can ask critical questions.
She goes through the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong of the speech because accurate questions cannot be asked.
I think it’s very important how the silk appears on the TV – the currency sweets, the hands wipes.
He compares Sibila to a father-in-law who now tells the people what to do.
If it works well, it can work well.
The situation is different than when the government is informed of something, because in this person it is like speaking directly to another person.
This (US President Barack Obama) Obama and his partners practice regularly.
Very exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens as truly exceptional.
He says that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
The exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the prime minister wants to make the Finnish people compassionate for the strikes that are facing.
On Friday, workers organised protests and strikes against the government’s actions.
Left union chairman Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, where the speech would also be discussed.
SDP’s chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces that he will challenge Sipila’s dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
A half year after the election.
Unfinished cannot be hidden, Rinne writes on Twitter.
9-Year-Old Boy Found in Turkey
The boy was in good condition at the time of his discovery.
The boy is over and over, the son's father updated his Facebook page.
The police officer also confirmed the case.
The boy went out to play at 4 a.m. in the afternoon.
Later in the evening he was no longer contacted.
I thank everyone who helped in the search.
Thank you for the tens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by youth violence: You can cause hatred
The Kurdish volunteer, Makwan Amirkhani, posted a video on Facebook in which he focuses on migrants.
Makwan Amirkhani held a strong speech against the street games of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at one of his Instagram accounts.
The account has been uploaded to videos in which young people are struggling with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he’s disappointed with the young people’s evil.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The remains throw the ground plates, sitting on the other and striking invisibly without thinking about any of these consequences, what this causes when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
Difficult to defend
Some of the young people seen in the video are immigrants.
The Helsinki police commissioner, Jarmo Heinosen, said the battle videos have been uploaded to the social media by immigrants and young people from the country.
Especially the fact that you are fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants harder here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that in Finland there are sites that search for the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot.
It’s a bit hard, guys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are in a stranger country still and you will be guests here for a long time.
This is a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they sometimes become the subject of someone’s racism, then you may blame yourself for it.
Think a couple of times before you go, you’ll go.
Amirkhani says that violence is a contribution to racism.
You’ll get a hate that I don’t like.
You have things somewhat bad, and that way you will not cure them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK holds its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK’s chairman Lauri Lyly tweeted that the salary organization is considering on Monday its standing on its alternative savings by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
The staff center organization STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it will submit to the government its own proposal to the 5% productivity rate demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wage-wage organization SAK soften its position.
The Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK’s work committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market portfolio" and that obligatory laws are needed by agreements made by active parties.
Lyly reminds that the proposal of the Prime Minister Sipila's government for a social agreement was not suitable for the SAK.
Sipilä would previously discontinue negotiations on the social agreement after the SAK did not agree to commit to the goal of the 5% productivity.
Comments Off on “Thanks to get rid of a little bit of fun”
It would be a bit ridiculous to have a nick if there is already a reconciliation paper in your pocket, says Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary in the salary of the winners from layer to layer.
Do you want to call the government down or do you agree with it?
On Monday, the Allied leaders of the SAK expressed holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened.
It spread to the akavalis.
The teachers’ professional organization OAJ threatened the closure of schools and dayhouses.
On Tuesday OAJ canceled: no school or dayhouses are completely closed.
On Wednesday, the chairman of the staff center organization STTK Antti Palola (sd) presented in a peaceful manner.
He said he was in contact with the government and prepared an alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central) for a 5% productivity rate.
Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), has urgently announced that his agreement is already ready.
At the beginning, the office of the SAK was not included.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (SD) is difficult to reach agreements when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAK’s work committee will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market portfolio”.
In order to create a joint proposal for the employers, the SAK should tend to adopt a five-percent productivity target.
It is no wonder that the STTK has a good relationship with the Government of Siberia.
The right hand of Palola, the director responsible for the social influence of the STTK, Jukka Ihanus, previously served as the special assistant of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniem.
Palola characterized that the government’s ay skills are constantly improving.
A coincidence or not, but the outcome of Palola took a bit of cleansing away from the Finnish standers, whose painting is made by the AKT’s Marko Piirainen (sd).
It would be a bit ridiculous to wear a nick if there is already a consensus paper in your pocket.
Amended at 18:00: Added information about Lilly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: "This should not be repeated"
The President of the Russian Duuma Sergei Naryshkin has criticized the Helsinki Etyj summit.
The President of the Russian Duuma, Sergei Naryshkin, said that Mongolia is a better ETIAS host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a prosecutor's session of the Parliamentary General Assembly of the ETIE has begun, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Celebration Meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were subjected to the European Union's sanctions list, to attend the meeting - a matter that the president said to remind journalists of.
We believe that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This should not be repeated, Naryshkin stressed by the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin’s criticism targeted Finland and the EU in addition to the United States, where his access was also banned.
Crimes are a political suicide for the EU, Naryshkin said.
The delegation of Russia arrived in Mongolia without trouble, so Naryshkin continued to torture Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met at Ulan Bator meeting leader Ilkka Kanerva, who, according to the Russian media, has already talked with the Russian delegation.
The lock faces the real playoff: "Paints strictly"
Tappara and Luko will continue today in the Hakam Forest with cattle days, when both are in fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicted that today in Hakamets there will be no real paintings.
The attack took place yesterday in a 3-2-step square.
The rise was male, since last season the silver group was in the worst of two goals loss.
The class was more successful on Tuesday.
The capture of the spacecraft as a guest of Blues, which started the capture, was round zero points, and the losses were like 2-3.
The hard game, the paintings strictly, if no one plays the same game as last year, the Lock-attacker Janne Lahti predicts the settings of the team on the pages.
The murderer has become a fairly playoff puzzle for the rabbits.
In the past two years, it has been just the end of the season.
In both cases, a decisive seventh match is required for the solution.
In the last season, Lukko caught the series down in the fourth game, but Tappara rose up in the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except the paintings.
Both of those who were rejected yesterday will get a peak today.
With the painting of the murderer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the Lukko-tollps, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Previous Post:Awesome Scene in the Mountains
The sports manager Toivola handled the main coach uncompatible subsequent part to the Rautakalli, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone directed a Rocky film, in which he himself played the main role.
The supporters sensationally put into camps the heavy series to the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got great sympathy, although he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first evening, Mika Toivola wrote a rough silver story for Pori.
The unnamed and wooden patapack advanced as a surprise for everyone to the SM finals of 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but strong subjects like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Porin Mattia and Pele Peltosta.
In the shooting games, the players painted their heads red and cut the irokees.
Hope became a blonde.
The famous TV speaker JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
He took the winning silver.
She was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that this season’s novel works the same as ten years ago.
A man who works as an ex sports manager has built a patapaca for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have hidden the remains in a distance as Rocky pigs in a massacre.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparisen’s gains are somewhere else than in the game.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the main character will be performed by Pekka Rautakallio.
Carry Stone has crucified the Rail Balloon to Sean Connery.
The Railroad is a rock film written by Toivola, one of the most famous actors that Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There is nothing else in the Railway Hall than the Rocky name.
The game philosophy of the railball does not include scratching and small music.
He appreciates a hard game, but there’s a different thing to play hard than a pig.
During the past season, Garret Stafford has gone back to the head of the Dead Jere.
He received 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Rail Bowl put the man in the shower.
He didn’t deserve a minute.
We only play those who deserve.
I don’t accept such a game and it doesn’t belong to the hassle, the hot Railway Hall rose after the game to the Hundred People.
This season’s team is strange.
There are trains, veterans, police and railers.
There are practically no key players in the best game age.
It is no wonder that the coach has complained about the skill.
How much have you been able to influence the player’s earnings, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season have influenced the procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was somewhat narrow, the Railway Board responded diplomatically.
Under the surface.
From the 1953 model, the Rautakallio is clearly interested in moving to the place of Toivola as a sports bomb.
Men’s contracts end in the spring.
The axis balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of losses with a goal difference 1-6.
Hopefully, it would not have been good to write a script.
Olga Temonen as Sipe Santapuk's Mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they’t have anything in common.
Olga Temonen will play for the first time in the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm presenting my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulan’s former bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is playing in Tuuka for the first time.
Olga's role in the movie "You're About Us Beautiful" that tells about the early years of Apulan, is the rumble Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
The circus cumbers and supports his son, even though this father, Risto (who is presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my real preview of the Circus, the easier it feels to play the role.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuuk that he trusted the role for me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that the twin has approached a lot.
They met, talked by phone and communicated.
The circle has helped a lot.
We have gone through many different corners of their history.
The circle also happily understands that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little colored.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, it was a great and a great time.
There was a relatively small chance that someone really succeeds, but the Circus had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot of Tuuka about this youth before the film plans.
The stories of my parents are a little different.
So, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, then how many parents really know what you’ve swallowed.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola's badly named scitcher.
Olga was a daily and kind girl who’t have anything to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have secretly admired.
Olgan says he has done so much cooperation with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a big joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now, the entire production group is going to Heinola for a month for descriptions.
However, the couple who live in Iit, for their little children, will often go home for a night, because the distance is not too long.
We will run for the whole month of Heinol.
They have taken us very warmly, just asked what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 is the most expensive film in Finland.
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film by Timo Vuorensola is €17 million.
It will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race is the most expensive film ever in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film was Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The animation of Angry Birds will come up after the completion of Iron Sky 2, with the film’s budget of over €100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma, will begin in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and will last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will go to Belgium next week.
The budget is not afraid.
I was sick at Reno.
I have such a relaxed fiil of the script because I know exactly what kind of paper should be.
Everyone in the work group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Although the time is strict, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I don't have to wait for this leaf to be shown to the public, he tells the Iltalehd.
Initially, the budget for the film was scheduled for 8-10 million, but with the development of the script, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but there is a big stock.
However, the film would have to get 100 million, because each image and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is turned so strictly that there is no loose.
The film producer Iron Sky Universe today launched a crowdfunding campaign and a crowdfunding loan, which will pay 4-8 percent annual interest.
The final interest rate will be determined according to demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The acting films include Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Cool or cool?
Big Logos Returns to Shorts
Trendsetters’ fronts have recently been decorated by large logos.
Until a while ago, the fashion-conscious clothes avoided clear and large logos like Crocse's consana.
The advertising of a Hupper or T-shirt mark was somehow seen as a train.
But the times change.
Sporting has become a real fashion megatrend, and so old, well-known sports fashion brands like Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolius wave.
And, as so often before, the boundary of the funny and trendy is shy: if something is already right, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, that is, the custom mode, in which trendsetter surprised by popularizing the most boring basic clothes as a way to get separated from the mass.
Now, instead of the gray basic collage, it is placed on the bottom of the cabin that has been buried by the network, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo is comed.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, such as Adidas’ identifiable railboards, favourite team games and New York Yankees tickets have made the return to the street fashion.
Calvin Klein’s logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands also to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's shoulder clothes will make it clear what type of clothes it is about.
Would you be ready to present the logos in your clothes?
A Russian politician has revealed evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank for hours!
According to the allegations, a special interference would have occurred in the Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to pull out the large-scale Zotov from the tank for five hours.
Zotov has done everything in its way to challenge the information.
He even posted on his own public Facebook page a picture in which he appears to have a very good mood of a pansar vehicle and not at least on the basis of the pictures it is about any swallow or swallow.
Full of stupidity.
Let’s start with that I didn’t go into the battle tank, but it was a battle tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, everstile colonel, I have served in Ural.
I went there, looked around and came out calmly, Zotov said to Pravdal.
I didn’t swallow and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian Army TV channel, Zotov explained in the exhibition his favourite Russian new technology, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, I loved our technology.
And I came out through the backyard, he said.
I went in all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I’m definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov was also foolish about the reporter who wrote about it.
One idiot wrote and all the others repeated.
Nothing like that was.
I went in and came out.
I'm long and rough, but nothing that I'd be somewhere stuck in the tank did not happen, he told Russkaja sluzhba novste radio.
Zotov’s words support the fact that no photographs of the alleged assassination have been published, although the assassination exhibition took place in a few days with a total of 50,000 people.
The claim of Zotov's injury began with the story on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to his thumbs of the tanks when he tried to get out and eventually threatened to shoot all around him unless he got out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a subsequent story in which the exhibition organizers stated their own views of what happened.
Everyone is just accustomed to the fact that soldiers are jumping out quickly from the armored vehicles.
But Deputy Zotov, due to his great size, simply stopped when he came out.
But he was not sitting there for five hours, the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski told Bloknot.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland is in the Kittilän mine.
The cleansed process water of the gold trees has flowed from the so-called enrichment sand pool to the coast.
According to the company, measures to repair the damage have been initiated.
In the altar there is neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
Usually, water is pumped either to be reused as a processing water or, in accordance with permission, brought into the environment through the surface cleaning field.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of water is in compliance with the current license conditions.
There was no other material in the environment.
The accident was detected during a check-in on Monday morning.
No collapse has been found to have caused structural damage to the basin patal structures.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mining company employs approximately 600 permanent workers.
IMF warns to cut too much
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) today published Finnish land report is largely in line with the Government and the Ministry of Finance’s views.
The Organization has pursued structural reforms to cover Finland in order to overcome the economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overworking remunerations and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms are needed in the whole contractual system as well as unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäe, we agree on the structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates there are a lot of sympathetic messages to the government’s actions, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case, for example, with infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to the Economy.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts that Finland will grow by 0.4 per cent this year, which will rise to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske today, in its new relationship forecast, predicts that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, the Statistical Center that the total production was in a small growth in the summer, Kuoppamäki said.
The industry’s weakened confidence or other so-called softer measurements could have been given less attention.
However, the difference is only a few percent decimal.
Nintendo has appointed a new manager.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwatan who died from cancer in July, will start his work on Wednesday, Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were highlighted as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track the footprints of Iwatan, assesses Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda to Reuters.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but so that it doesn’t eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers come to Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency recognized that hundreds of children who have arrived in the country are missing each year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, there are hundreds of minors missing in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, the supervisor of the Immigration Agency, tells us what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear "under the land" per year?- In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in 2013.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared.
The latter of the disappearance may be that in the process of the case it is established that the applicant has already been registered in any other country applicable to the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been identified as a full age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the processing of the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
In the same way, some of the missing people are also found later when they are seeking asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were withdrawn because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past year, he says.
Is the number growing?
This year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for minors who arrived alone.
The total statistics of missing minors this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is therefore known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing, he emphasizes.
What about those who received the translation decision?
Are they going to go to the “dark market”?
This is difficult to assess by the Migration Agency, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa emphasizes.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered land aspirants.
He has taken action in this matter.
Orpo, who discussed the issues of refugees at the EU’s internal ministry meeting on Monday, said the practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the device
Timo T.A., a media career manager who lost his workforce due to illness attacks, is now on sale with the equipment used for Mikkosen’s television and radio productions.
Mikkosen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced professional tools in her industry.
The first announcement was announced by the Webmaster.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained in the foot of technological developments.
In the digital media world, there are no more TV shows for Betacam groups.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be people interested in it.
Hardware, of course, is no longer up-to-date in this way, but it is also necessary as long as there is such a generation of material that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of fans - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks of IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Stormhouse.
We cannot bring all the goods with us.
I slowly started to invent and see what goods are delivered.
That’s what I’ve started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no more use of TV and radio devices.
After repeated strokes, it is clear that a long career man is no longer returning to work.
Nina Mikkonen notes that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real life work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials from the Storm.
Traffic threatens to break worse than thought: Metro and railways can stop for the whole Friday
Metro and rail trains drivers will decide today whether to extend their forces in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and railway traffic only for the time of the protest on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
The main trust man Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
Night and mountain cuts harshly scratch the drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the additions raise opposition.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic throughout the day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and railway stops for Friday, the public transport is almost completely stopped in the capital region.
According to the news agency, trains will not run between Friday morning and afternoon.
On Friday there will be no traffic or traffic.
The trains departing before the morning will be taken to the destination stations.
According to HSL, the majority of the buses are on a varicose route.
The members of the ACT are left from work on Friday morning from three to three a.m. on Saturday morning.

Repo says HSL is unable to tell exactly what buses will go on Friday.
Employers organize a mass demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday at 11-13.

Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thought his own clock was a bomb
In the U.S., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher took his own clock to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his electronic attack on the output.
One of the teachers, however, considered the clock like a bomb.
The police were called to the place, and the situation ended with the fact that the boy was taken in the hands of a young woman to the arrest card.
Mohammed has never claimed anything other than that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the clock looked like a “film bomb.”
The clock is in custody by the police, but it was composed of a circle plate and a digital display between which there were leaders.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedi was sentenced to three days in prison from school.
His father is angry about the case and the country’s American-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is again a sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
British Labour leader refuses to sing national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the kingdom, but Corbyn is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also agreed with the members of Corbyn’s Labour Party.
This has offended the people, Labour deputy Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have agreed to the song.
The ceremony was celebrated on the occasion of the British Air Force pilots’ battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and emphasizes that he has shown his respect for the pilots by participating in the opportunity.
We are all in great gratitude to the heroicity of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national song, the statement was emphasized.
Corbyn's election as a party leader has divided Labour's lines.
Especially among the MPs, there are those who are afraid that he will throw out moderate voters with their radical views.
Corbyn supports a unilateral assertion, the cessation of savings and the increase in public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear today for the first time as a party leader in Parliament on the Prime Minister's questionnaire.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron announced on Twitter the election of Corbyn as a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families.
The cause of the family murder in Minnesota is still unclear - the family's father was waiting for a trial
South Lake Minnetonka police have investigated the family murder in Greenwood in Minnesota for a week.
The five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in a garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was worried about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for inspection and found a huge house from all over the shorts of the Short family as dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for several days.
Millionaire and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motivation for the blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 StarTribune interview, Short said that the site had four million different visitors per week.
I have received 50 purchases from the company over the past 10 years.
I have abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I will sell the company, but not yet.
Short’s family bought a house from Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
The legal case ongoing
According to StarTribune, the family’s father was waiting for a trial.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prepairing courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, short’s website did not remove prepairing comments, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short’s transactions.

And I’m holding my thorn, Loiri scratches.
The NHL star's incredibly amazing gesture - "the greatest donation made by an athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital’s report, this is the largest individual donation done by an athlete ever to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital in other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year and $72 million contract with Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly greater than his $9 million annual revenue.
As a prize for his donation, Subban receives a wave room from the hospital with his name.
Canadian players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
The long-term captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, collected millions of dollars, among other things, for the same children’s hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for the other city’s major hospital, bringing the PET scanner needed for cancer studies to the hospital.

Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share data based on the web.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, CEO of Intel Security.
ASRB allows Intel to establish security-related best practices and support the vision that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB council the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.

Kim Kardashian's Mother's Style Is Revealed - Now It's Showing Breasts
True TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives themes one after the other.
She’s presenting her pregnancy clothes and breast clothes in gloriously sexy clothes last night at one American time when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West’s clothes.
The black breast is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored breasts under the clothes in the flash of the blasts.
Last time, Kardashian was dressed in an Amatsonian maternity suit when she went to her friend for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
It was highlighted by the black overknees.
The third special maternity is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the presentation year had its pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you’re lonely, the competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to divide the idea that the model world would be of pure glamour and champagne party.
She made her own documentary Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), where Leloup and her colleagues talk their mouths clearly about the model.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from empty.
Although in the previous season you’d been posing in the houses of top designers, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the field, competing for work with concare.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is a continuous journey and can go through years so that the hostel is a hotel room or an apartment in which the fashion houses accommodate their model.
If you’re too young and a mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one sort of scratch.
An agent in New York may ask for a lost pounds, but in Paris then they say you’re too weak.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
During the Fashion Week, models and designers are constantly together and function as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference is weak.
Models want this field because of the possibilities it offers, but they're fascinated by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
They want to be their own personalities.
Work makes the models feel that they are actors who have some role.
But in the work of the model can also express itself.
The show was held by Tory Burch.
New York City is currently celebrating a fashion week, where designers will unveil their next year model.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, shows the most unknown Apulanta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautalaa, the founder of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta group.
Lautala founded Apulan in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I’m a rap artist who will be 26 years old, and in this film I’m presenting a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I didn’t want to meet the right Ant before the descriptions because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people about that band, so I think it’s quite good that I teach her playing style only by video.
I don’t want to imitate a man.
A man who trusts the Roope Salminen and Dogs group is not the source of the role.
Punk-maners come according to the man in nature.
In the punk season of the Star, the Star program, many of you will surely see the example, as well as if you’ve ever visited our cakes.
Our appearance has never been a little bit, but we are always going full.
At the support of the 1993-2004 bass playing Tuukka Temosen directed Teit of us beautiful film the main actors were announced today.
The band's core group, which has become known to the public, is presented to the large public by young actors still quite unknown.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukkia presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave tips about her future washing already yesterday evening, when she told Snapchat that she’s mysteriously preparing for her career’s most important day.
Roope has already posted a picture on Instagram of his new look, which he has to make for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the weekly and leukaparras, has turned his face siloposky, and painted his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have been thinking about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to Europe.
Or is it worth telling it at all?
It is not necessary to take it as a strong speech, a member of the crisis group of the SPR, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting younger children, and not, for example, let them watch news alone.
Small children aren’t always able to understand what they see, and it can stop turning in mind and worry, he says.
However, if the child has met on television news photos of refugees or has heard of it elsewhere, it is worth taking it as a talk.
It is good for the discussion to go from the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s fears can be surprising.
They may not necessarily be those that the parent thinks he's afraid of.
It is not necessary to fear the child, even if he is worried and scared.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Bigger children are likely to encounter a conversation about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are well.
Parents can, together with their children, think about how our family is treated with this.
Is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This can be beneficial for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weak"
Your strength at the end?
You can be a good parent for your child.
Vermoon Pallosalama is difficult to overcome
In the middle of the day, the Pallosalam was hit by Apila Pallosalam.
It only broke victories and doubles until the end of July there was a collapse in the Tampere rays.
As the orphan hunted to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protector time from the veterinarian.
The explanation of the disappearance was revealed in the starlight.
The horse had a headache.
The disease was not from the slightest to the slightest, but it needed two medications.
Since Apila Pallosalama had to be on a light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse's last race.
It was the second record in the market after the Storytelling.
The Apila Pallosalama was very stressed from the break, when it had been able to drive normally for just a few weeks.
These things considering a small tendance in the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the orphan a sharp.
The horse was going forward, and hopefully it would also be balanced.
It has been the so-called humour.
If he did not enjoy it, he was able to throw it out without getting sick.
On the good day of the orphanage, instead, there has been such a spell that the opponents have been in their miracles.
At a fixed speed, the competitors will not be able to reach the Pallosalam, from which even warm-blooded cows will get rid.
In the basement there is a desire in Vermo.
The difference, however, is how the Apila Pallosalama agrees to it.
It’s quite difficult at the time of departure and can even put a fine under the road of the departure car and so on.
I hope it will be more quiet than when I go.
Apila Pallosalama will be able to get out of the ball as well, and we’re going to drive with it for the victory, the coach promises.
That's why you won't get rid of the useless iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple’s iPhone phones’ upcoming programs may sometimes be deleted in the future – but not all of them.
Apple is likely planning to remove some of its own apps from its iPhone phones in the future, said CEO Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed.
Apple’s iPhone contains a series of programs that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newspapers, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest add-on to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a compulsory introduction to iPhone phones, although it’s only necessary for Apple’s smartwatch owners.
Cook says the deletion of Apple’s programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems anywhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the case because it does not want to waste memory from iPhone users.
Inflation in the Eurozone fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, 0.1 per cent of the year, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices led to the lowering of energy.
The Eurostat reviewed the 0.2% forecast a little down from a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell in August to 0.9 percent from 1.0 percent in July.
The Eurostat forecast for the base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2 percent cheaper in the euro area last month than a year ago.
In the 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
The increase in July was 0.1%.
More than 1.4% of consumer prices rose in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest in prices falling by 1.9 percent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 percent minus according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the eurozone remains strictly far from the European Central Bank (ECB)'s target, which is an estimated 2% price rise in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an inflation rate of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
The next year, the increase will rise to 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published in early September.
The U.S. Fed is trying to strengthen monetary policy.
The next U.S. recession will begin at the fastest rate in less than a year, but more likely in three years after the U.S. central bank (Fed) will begin to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline in turn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has announced that it will start interest purchases this week and by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed up at its fastest by the coming autumn and as the financial market currents before it.
Or at least this will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets act as they’ve used to – and if they react to the Fed’s money push as they’ve done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international big customers last week.
The strategists prepared the survey and the report do not believe to know exactly when the Fed will begin to raise its interest rates or what in the economy and markets will happen after that.
Instead, through their cool facts and calculations, they present the economic statistics how the economy and markets have behaved in the time and after the Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they look at what the key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different model as in the time of previous interest rates - and what is likely to follow from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a much greater condition to stand the interest rate rise than once before the 1950s.
It may not be the beginning of recession.
The leaders who decide on the monetary policy of the Fed and its current trend have indicated throughout last summer and early autumn that the time has begun to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first rise of interest over nine years may occur this week.
The issue will be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday as the Fed’s Board’s so-called Open Market Committee will meet to resolve the issue on its two-day meeting.
For the first time, the Fed increased its so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
That ended the two-year series of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 per cent interest rates, with the Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial market syndrome began in 2007 with the US’s most risky housing financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global nightmare on the Day of Judgment.
A great recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious disadvantages in the financial markets and the real economy began to slow down than the previous Fed interest rates typically occurred.
In the same way, the trials were then harder and harder than once before the 1930s.
Deutsche strategists have scaned the rise and falls of the world’s largest economies, as well as the turnover of the financial markets since 1950 and in places all since the beginning of the 19th century.
The interest rates of the Fed and their economic and financial impacts have been revealed since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, the fastest time since the first interest rate has passed is less than a year, mostly less than three years and an average less than three and a half years.
The growth of the financial markets has ended within two years from the start of the Fed interest rates.
The Fed has slowly raised and slowly decreased its rate since the beginning of the 1950s by a dozen unlimited cycles.
Each time has varied in some ways from the other, and the times are considered relatively low, so on their basis we can hardly conclude any certainty about the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategists remind that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis were not necessarily identified by decades of research.
But three facts that led to the crisis and the causes that increased its destructive power are probably somewhat undisputed:
1) The Fed, the Eurozone ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their currency interest rates too low in the 21st century for too long.
They fixed the traces of the tech group, and at the same time raised the next one.
(2) The amount of debt accumulated over the decades in the various parts of the financial and real economy, and yet too much, increased even more due to the influence of the monetary policy of the central banks’ surplus.
It was the biggest debt in history.
3) In particular, the crazy debt financing packed with the financial funds, which was closest to the financial funds, spread to most parts of the financial markets the biggest currency doubles of the previous financial history, from shares to real estate, bonds and goods.
Nevertheless, there is hardly a very severe controversy that the financial markets that rise to the heights due to the increasingly complex debt faults were rarely in a dangerous and unstable situation, when the Fed and other central banks last put interest rates up.
The financial structures incurred to the debt faults received the valuation faults did not last until their time after the interest purchases had begun and the debt financing costs had turned to rise.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
More money and more debt
Deutsche strategists don’t guess what’s going to happen, but they give the subject to the subject by mentioning, for example, the following kinds of facts:
The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy currents even lighter even longer than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for a long time before the crisis, they would have been even lower for a long time.
For a long time, debt has not been as crazy as ten years ago, but now the debt is literally cheaper than the free.
Thus, the financial and real-world economy has not leaked in debt, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden is drastically more heavy than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has become even cheaper and cheaper from the central banks has mostly remained in the financial markets and has stumbled the key securities and assets to its most expensive since the peak prior to the financial crisis or ever.
Not only are the strategists the Latin atmosphere with financial market warnings, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the most severe recession to the model that has ever been.
The economy of the Eurozone has hardly recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusual weak state, but the pressures and risks on the financial markets are unparalleledly greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed will subsequently start striking its fundraising to stricter.
Per the image of the future of the French bank’s Societe Generale strategist Albert Edward’s is not as strange as it can impact.
He has for a long time trained the bank’s international investor clients for the following full provisions of the Fed:
First the Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial doubts will explode – and soon it’s time for the Fed to shut down the financial doubts with even greater QE currencies.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer company, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the discounts are aimed at HP’s corporate service, the company says.
In November, HP will be divided into the company Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer-oriented PCs and printers.
HP’s staff was the highest in 2011, with a total of 350000 employees.
Last year, the number of employees was reduced to 30,000.
The company accounts for $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) of one-time expenditure.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25,000 to 300,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business in such a way that no one of its customers will no longer be responsible for more than 10 percent of its turnover.
In the next year, its three major customers brought 65 percent of the turnover.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System for iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking on “General” and then selecting “Software Update”.
If the update is ready, the phone will give the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems after this installation when the error message “Software Update failed” appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst breakthrough or try updating through the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include deleting applications to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the update size and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests deletable applications and then reinstall them when the update is finished.
It is advisable to make sure that the phone is charged or charged close during the update, so that the battery does not stop.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to move forward, as if the battery is over, it may lead to a update breach.

General: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the Tax Paradise Company
Transport and Communications Minister Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
The company is associated with the so-called tax planning.
It is a luxembourgian company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains a member of the government.
Berner himself says he has resigned from membership in May of this year.
I checked it and it was enough that I left a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on a agreed schedule, Berner says Yle in an interview.
Membership after the Fusion
Through the Luxembourg Company, the property of the Swedish company Kährs is managed.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia-Upoflor government from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger in the Kährs government and in the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, the property of Kährs passes through the multilateral property structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yl that he accepted government membership in the luxembourgean company Kährs at the request of the second-largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the Karelia-Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was searched for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the realization of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the revenues of our Finnish companies’ capital are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yl that Hartwall Capital’s ownership in the company is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex property structure set up in the tax parish is due to the fact that the capital fund Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, had a luxembourgean holding company already ready for ownership.
A reception center is opened by the company
In Espoo Otanyama, the first reception center for adult asylum seekers will be opened by the company.
The reception center is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this afternoon.
The number of places can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes a reception center for the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The activity is managed by Luona Oy, whose activity is in particular the production of healthcare and nursing services.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the center.
STTK prepares an alternative work-life striking package
The STTK is starting to prepare an alternative package for the government’s working lives.
The organization also wants to participate in other wage organizations.
President Antti Palola said the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative methods to lower the price of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola noted the organization’s administration meeting at a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Trade Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have estimated that the change assurance contained in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, while the other side of the package is €2700 million.
I don’t know if the party has a terrible passion to go to a conversation if there is one relationship with one hundred.
The dialogue was constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as then the government is to give a message to the parliament on its own package and begin preparation for the reforms.
He did not know if the schedule was realistic.
The dialogue with the government has, according to Palola, existed, and it has been constantly constructive for him.
The staff center organization STTK’s field, especially Sunday’s operations, is a painful place according to Palola.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from a compulsory legislation that it would implement some of the exploits.
In the STTK, according to Palola, there is no warming for the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP that had the subject.
Employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the government’s last week presented work-life striking package.
As part of the package, the salary for the first days of illness will be cut, overwork compensation will be half, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent, and vacation will be shortened.
The STTK emphasizes that the central organizations have invited employees to demonstrate and did not intend to arrange a strike.
Feyenoord grateful
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder congratulates STTK on the announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK will now come to the same lines with Akava, as in Akava an alternative model for government proposals has already been drawn up for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change and work-time projects.
Akava said on Wednesday that it has long prepared its own proposal, with which it is ready to negotiate the country’s government to pursue a 5% competitiveness drop as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been constantly ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to see the terms and conditions of the service relationship as part of the contract.
In contrast, we want change security and work-time projects, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the country’s government and employers, Fjäder says.
The work committee will meet on Thursday at 5 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talcoats" - playing bingo when speaking in the evening
Green Left University of Tampere
The University of Tampere Green Left Viva Bingo Cup for the evening.
The Prime Minister has previously held exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälé rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland’s economy on Ylen channels on Wednesday afternoon at 21.05.
The request for the previous speech of the prime minister must go to the year 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister while holding a famous radio interview that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälé rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers held a number of broadcasts during the Winter and Continuing War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held President Mauno Koiviston instead of New Year's Speech, but it was more a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train makers’ strike with a television conversation.
Monarchism, Monarchism and Monarchism
The speech of Sipila has raised criticism and speculation throughout the day about what will come.
Left union chairman Paavo Arhinmäki tweeted that "Sipilä could see his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech would also be discussed."
According to the Greens, “a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP’s Erkki Tuomioja sentenced on Facebook that “monarchist thing: the prime minister tells the people what’s best for him.”
SDP’s chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipila’s dialogue: “I’ve been a half year since the elections.
There is no presence of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
has been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the state council, the speech of Sipila is recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, this was commented in a direct broadcast by SAK’s chairman Lauri Lyly and EC’s executive director Jyri Häkämies.
It is generally criticized by the speech of Sibiu.
We considered the matter and stated that it belongs to the task of the public service to promote the comprehensive publicity of all of Finland, according to Ylen publications director Ismo Silvo Ylen in the news.
As we were in the time.
The speech has also caused disagreements.
After the evening, dinner is pleased in good time, the children are sheltered and dressed in their best.
The mother puts the column on her, and the father adjusts the nod on her neck.
At nine a.m. we are silent on the front of the television as before Me Tammeloe’s time,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Why does the Prime Minister Sipilä, in his speech, also explain why in the Finnish government there are millions who hide their capital in the tax parishes, who make compassion laws to their other tax evacuation friends and at the same time claim to the people that it is forced to cut when the money is over from the state?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left Viva University of Tampere.
It has posted a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear at night of the same boat, the common coal, the debt of life and the team spirit?
Coupon and pen ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to exclude al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia’s offer to resign Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaare, the Russian Ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan that al-Assad would be withdrawn from power elegantly after some time.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall over a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaare, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed him in a bilateral discussion three points of the plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to get a conversation immediately, and the withdrawal of al-Assad had to be carried out mildly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not necessarily agree on all things, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told her what I did there and she said to sit in Alas, Martti, so I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in a Guardian interview.
The diplomats do not comment.
Ahtisaari said he had sent a message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaare there are no two words about it.
The United Nations diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations of Ahtisaari, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed a number of mass murders at that time and key opposition groups refused any agreements he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East department of the UK’s Foreign Ministry, addresses Ahtisaari’s speeches with doubts because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss al-Assad’s fate.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaar's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with the authorization of Moscow.
If he had told me about Churkin's speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear the same president Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have been suspected in that case that it would have been a matter of Putin's holding power by some of the al-Assad supporters.
Refugees in our own actions
During the Ahtisaari talks, approximately 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 in the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own.
I don’t see any other option than to take care of these rough people.
We now pay the invoice that we have made ourselves, says Ahtisaari to the newspaper.
The Refugee Organization Centre in Turkey
The Government’s Northern Finland Refugee Organization Centre is likely to be established in Turni.
The center will be established in the empty Tornion Community Building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has searched for a suitable place to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat on Tuesday that the committee had already decided to present the school building as a spatial solution to the ministry.
The deputy chairman of the city council, Sauli Hyöppisen, said this is not true.
When the entire delegation was not gathered and a part of the crowd wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specifies to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
There were 13 representatives opposed.
We can expect the decision to be positive, he says.
Mayor Timo Nousiaisen said the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was reacted quickly.
It is estimated that there will be 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has gone to check whether it could be applied to such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, Nousiainen says.
The U.S. continues to hope for an alternative to strikes on the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central), the half reduction of the vacation funds in the public would only take care of a part of the government’s aim to calculate the price of work.
According to him, the government will, however, be pleased to accept an alternative package if the social organizations succeed in an agreement.
She told reporters that she had not been in contact with social organizations.
He also didn’t know how seriously the organizations are looking for a replacement for the government’s announced labor outbreaks.
If such a contract occurs, we will welcome it with pleasure as part of the entire package.
Halfing the vacation funds would be a functional means, because it would affect almost all wages, unlike, for example, the government’s plan to cut Sunday holidays.
The social organizations could agree with each other about the cutting of vacation funds because they are registered in trade agreements rather than in law.
The Government will tell the parliament on Wednesday about the strikes in labor as a state council announcement.
I say the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
The final limit is not that either.
Legislative work starts then, i.e. the train is moving and it becomes more and more difficult.
Now there is a good time.
It doesn’t take a long time in such a matter, if there is a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published last week by the Government includes, among other things, the conversion of the final and light thirst to unpaid holidays without shortening the yearly working time.
In addition, the salary for the first days of illness is cut, overwork compensation is half, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75 percent, and holidays are shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as a compulsory legislation over the trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
Employers’ central organizations are holding a mass demonstration on Friday because of their actions, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi authority approved the extension of the Sugar Hall stock
The Tohmajärvi authority unanimously, but slightly, approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the Sugar Hall stock.
The assessment was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than it was initially mentioned.
Also a busy schedule.
It was also somewhat surprising that the land demand was not known a year ago when the decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock at 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment program, but the funds are determined as more imported in the context of the annual report.
The agenda also discussed the investment of €150,000 to €200,000, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be €300,000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The city has no risk, because the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
The language of Karel is in the river.
The city government relieved its previously sharp stance on bringing carelong-speaking street mines to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in the mind of the rise of the carnivorous tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karel language because it has no historical grounds and the Karel language is not a natural part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the region of Yunnan has become more part of the Eastern Savola Murtis.
After the new decision, there will be no carlanguage street names in the city center.
However, the city of Joensuun is, by good consideration, ready for the use of the Karela language, for example, in the infotables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude the city recommends to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, the use of the Karel language should also be approached spatially now that the multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in the North Karel.
The language of Karela is still the specific features of the province, as well as the image of Joensuus as the entire Finnish forest capital.
Both of them can be beneficial in the various types of marketing in the province.
The interruption of railways cuts the vitality of the province
Cuts of railway connections strike the province with a hard hand.
Transportation connections have a direct impact on the industry and competitiveness of the province.
And that’s what it affects whether you can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Karijalainen wonders.
He also highlights the air traffic, which has also been continued several times in the report.
It is important for the entire countryside that our possibilities to overcome are not reduced by the measures of the state power, as it is now going on.
The impact of these interruptions of traffic connections should be seen, for example, on employment, Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of traffic connections causes an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Indeed, the better services here are, such as traffic connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He notes that poor traffic connections also affect the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to the research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already at the moment, the university’s marketing toward West Finland is difficult because the traffic connections are weak at the same time.
Approximately half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland are currently from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 percent of them are from New Zealand, which is partially explained by direct railway.
The river became one of the worshippers of the war.
The view of the Joensuun municipal government on the province’s Siun war project is apparently unanimous, but there is one among the speakers.
Member of the City Government, Pentti Keskisalo (s.d., in the picture), on Monday's meeting of the Government proposed to give up the entire project, but his proposal was unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a resolution by the Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all the other municipalities.
One train ride from Kouvola to Kotka ends next year
The personal train transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although the number of passengers is less.
There will be changes in personal trains between Kotka and Kouvolan in March.
One train pair goes away, but still five times a day you get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
This is due to state savings.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail transport purchase expenditure for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The most quiet routes will be completed.
VR will set up new schedules by the end of the year.
It will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the boys lived from the place.
The rescue team released a 12-year-old man who climbed from the roof and was unable to get down from the roof by his own help.
The incident occurred in the Tower of Ketoti at half a six a.m. Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house, with no roofs to get to the roof at all.
It didn’t stop the boys, who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the radioamaters’ threshold next to it.
The other men came down the same path, but one didn’t.
The result was that the others lived from the site and the passengers warned the rescue facility to the site to help the veterans safely return to the ground.
FedEx’s business profits double, decreases 2016 tax year prospects
FedEx has depressing results in its last quarter, and the supply gap has dropped its year-round outcome forecast, due to the decreased demand for cargo services and the higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it intends to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
For this time last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening hour on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the outcome of the tax year that ends in May to be $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower prospects came despite the average price increases of 4.9 per cent coming into force on 4 January, and despite the higher additional fees started in November for heavy or large package land transport.
The company said it expects business profits to continue to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trading is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “proved steadily taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, in production and global trade.”
The plans for wages for the vacation period were announced a day after the competitor UPS said it intends to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same amount it paid last year.
In the quarter ended on 31 August, FedEx’s revenue was $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which remains from the $2.44 average forecast. 12 analytics survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority shipping, which has stopped the growth of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the increase in online trading has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the gross unit's turnover increased by 29 percent, but the revenue of the operations was in principle the same due to the expensive cost of bigger packages and its own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic payments, while the business profit in the trade was reduced by higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell at $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
FedEx closed on Tuesday 11 percent in bills for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
The U.S. Central Bank’s decision makers are sitting around a huge stomach table for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
On the other side of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the chairman of the central bank, Janet L. Yellenin, and his colleagues should place the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Congress has fallen on the heart of the central bank a double responsibility: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, after a big failure, the central bank’s leaders have agreed that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This is the third requirement that can be a crucial factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it can not even be predicted. The decision on whether the U.S. economy is ready to deviate from the record incentive, which has been brought by the short-term interest rate zero since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the data indicate that the economy is growing stable, the recent trend on the global financial markets may have made the central bank officials already in advance more stable in terms of increasing instability. We are afraid how it would impact if the federal funds rate would be raised by even a quarter of the percentage unit.
“Comprehensively, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important aspects to be followed,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, specialist in the economy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for the interest rate to be overturned, the increased uncertainty on the global market is sufficiently qualified to wait yet,” he says.
The central bank’s decision has not reached an agreement, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, approximately half of economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the rise, as the key indicator says the possibility of growth is only about 30 percent.
This indicates a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level unless the decision makers then manage to mitigate the blow by promising that the next rise will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index rose by 228.89 points, 1.4% to a new figure of 16.599.85.
The recovery led to the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unlikely this week, says John Lonski, Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group’s final economy expert.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest right now,” he says.
If the decision makers raise interest rates, “they have to see a lot of effort in their direction to support the financial markets so that they don’t get in panic.”
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets as it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Just a month ago it seemed that the central bank would raise the interest rate this month by a quarter-percent unit, thus taking the first small step towards a slow exhaust of the monetary economy, which would verify the stability of the U.S. recovery.
He said in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the liberals demand further economic development in his complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped last month to 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers the full employment limit.
The increase in wages has shown signs of excitement.
Although inflation remains below the central bank’s annual target of 2 percent, the central bank’s decision makers say the main reason for this is the temporary impact of a significant decline in oil prices.
“The economy is clear of even higher interest rates and also needs them, taking into account the strict situation on the labour market,” says Ian Shepherdson, a final economy expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The world’s financial markets, however, shocked last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index dropped up to 16 percent from its record in May, as investors feared that China’s slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The market has somewhat recovered this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below the top of May.
For the central bank’s decision makers, the market milering is an additional factor in the complex equation, which tells us why the interest rate should be raised.
“Without these events in the financial market and the recent news of the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision makers would sharpen the level at this meeting,” says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
“The potential impacts on the U.S. economy are still quite unclear, and they have little information on the consequences of the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been immense.
In 2013, the indication of the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, that the central bank can “solve” the increase in the amount of money, caused mutations in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly rooted together, central bank officials are expected not only to follow the developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted to the movement of the financial market, which has made it different from the fundamental factors of the economy.”
The Federal Open Market Committee has urged the interest rate to be raised, and Lacker, a voting member of the Committee, quotes an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 per cent points during the three meetings “in spite of its limited, identifiable effects on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these cuts.
The central bank should put economic stability at the forefront only during a major crisis, as when the markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The last mylerry will not be close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation where a rise of interest is feared because the markets are harmonying,” said Posen, Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The federal law on the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve Act) still contains a double requirement and does not mention financial stability. As long as it is so, I think they should not predict it.

Brazilian child care organization in Rio de Janeiro promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing images of babies breastfeeding with painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to add their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should do.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their baby’s genetic manifestation and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favourite in the audience, despite the Nine Channel attempts to report the lead show in the Today Show program
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's flight to Canberra to report the next goal of the Liberal Party's leader's disclosure failed to increase Today's audience.
The Nine Channel's morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull pushed over Tony Abbott.
The competitive Sunrise program, carried out by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The length of the distance didn’t seem to hurt the Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s viewing rate in five state cities was 397 000, while Today’s number was 339 000.
The Todai average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, the average Today was 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
Until now, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, while Today has an average of 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The winds will float this morning elsewhere than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for the question!
Published today on Monday, September 14, 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 Word series, which features the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, a stunning premiere.
The new drama series, which collected a pretty impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells a recent widow father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have been wondering whether Thomson will be a popular series carrier alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results last night gave it real certainty.
Seven-channel The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838 000) and TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven Channel had a double fate in the second night of the Chase Australia series.
Andrew O’Keefe’s first half-hour show (17-17.30) attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17.30-18) raised 623,000 viewers - which was enough for a small win from Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewing score was 520,000, and the second half-hour was a maximum of 720,000.
The Hot Seat average was 620,000.
The Chase Australian's second-night viewing rate decline brings Nine's confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 17.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce the audience of McGuire’s show.
Originally published under the name Sunrise runs, Today remains local
The final triangle is in agreement with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who will win The Bachelor series.
The identity of her woman is kept extremely secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The remaining three girls don’t really know who got the last rose.
However, when we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before the three were two, they could undoubtedly give a clue about the winner’s identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women were thrown into poetry when telling how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
But when they were asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, to whom should it go?”, their answers could provide an explanation of who won the boy’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best alternative for Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been uncomplicated since the first day.
“Since I walked into the house, (Sarah’s) energies and Sam’s energies seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind throughout the series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is really close to the earth, it’s fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I have seen them together and there is chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood are going to be a good couple.
Mackay said that last week’s home visits made her realize that Wood could be “the right thing.”
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game – I’m now with all my heart involved here,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say,” he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a balance between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 19.30 on the Ten Channel.
One thought on “Sarah’s Best Alternative to Sam Wood?”
Jarryd Hayn has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested when he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his impressive open training day after the end of last year.
Hayne, however, chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seemed to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the exchange for the final game after this Australian rugby league reversal dropped the ball in his first flight return when the team defeated Minnesota on Tuesday with a 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and allowed Hayne to return the next flight bowl and took him in a running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula also appeared in the dressroom after the game.
Instead of hunting his new outcomes as a puzzle in front of the other team, he would encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Haynea publicly at a post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reports that Haynea will also encourage special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the droped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the airbag that Minnesota Vikings dropped in the first quarter of the game
This really wasn’t the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for a man’s NFL debut.
Haynen was seen as a curse on his way out of the field after the fall, and later he told the Australian radio force Hamish & Andyl to the 2DayFM channel at a frequency of 104.1, that he’t be able to imagine a worse start for his NFL race.
“It was just one of these stories now, we just have to think about the next game and it’s there,” Hayne said.
Hayne reversed his painting in his 2007 Origin debut when the food in his own painting area led to the painting of Queensland.
It was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne poseed in a photo posted on his Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, the wealthiest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with weapons on the Siberian railroad.
Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was captured and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
Four killed in police shooting against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal by police shooting rubber products into a crowd that demonstrated opposition to the country's new constitutional proposal, the authorities said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
The region’s top official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fireworks.
Dhakal said the police used a tear gas and then shot in the air before recouring to rubber products.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber wheels, known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The summary was in the last weeks of violent protests across the southern part of Nepal, with members of the ethnic group called Madhesi saying that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since the 10th of August, at least 40 people have been killed, 11 of them were police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement by which the country was divided into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been a central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned until 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the destructive earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Legislatives have voted this week on the clauses of the Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be approved by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC says it has 60 percent chance of a rotating storm in the south of Cape Verde.
The flat low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cycling storm in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another precise low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde Island Group and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cycling storm in the next two days, the climate center in Miami added.
Google starts donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign aimed at gathering $11 million to humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees arriving in Europe to escape from war breaks and poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective when it posted a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being announced by a manager, his own personal experience was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled with his family from Kabul at the age of seven.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
The donations are granted to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will respond to the same amount for every global donation on the google.com/refugeerelief site up to $5.5 million, so the overall target is $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been ongoing since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has led more than 4 million people to their homes this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help slightly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits obtained by mildly obese type 2 diabetics from weight loss surgery can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these slightly obese diabetics will live after weight loss surgery longer than those treated by other methods than by surgery.
“It will take a long time to obtain mortality data,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss surgeon who wrote the main book for a new study in the JAMA Surgery Journal of Age.
In weight loss or bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce the size of the abdomen.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have been patiently obese, and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The BMI or weight ratio to length is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is above 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is above 30, it is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal transplant surgery and stomach reduction, with drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those people who were treated with other means than surgery remained approximately the same in 29.
In 36 percent of the infected, diabetes healed completely and in 28 percent partially.
For comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes completely healed by only 1 percent and partially about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the cutting group,” the authors said.
The researchers also followed patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the long term.
The hemoglobin A1c level should remain below 7 percent, the researchers write.
The level of hemoglobin A1c after surgery dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
However, this better “glycemic control,” described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over the course of five years, says chief scientist Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
In the fifth year, when compared to the group in the abdominal reduction surgery, the group in the abdominal transplant had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), dropped more weight (7.4 and 5.1), dropped more hemoglobin to A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and was more likely to a complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are results of research from Sweden where the surgery led to longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obesity patients who were under weight loss surgery had 29 percent lower chances of dying over a 15-year period when compared to those who had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 and who are interested in surgery.
“The results of the research are crucial just in the fact that they show that the operation is safe for the group of lower weight index,” and it is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the stage when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ll wait too long before we take it seriously,” he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, withdrawing the situation is very difficult.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the cessation of violence in the country of refugees.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation the needs of the whole humanity should be placed above individual nations or even continents.
He also emphasized that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admired, it is also insufficient.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s actions in the crisis, he emphasized that it was just a temporary solution.
“It’s great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about the long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the deaths in their countries.
We need to reduce our power use.
Power use has never solved these problems,” he added.
Taking a position on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the U.S. violent response caused a chain of narrow events.
“After 9/11, in a letter I expressed my consent to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through violence.
I know that his motives were good, but he used strength and it created unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, the number of infected children has increased to four times.
Toxicity data centers across the U.S. have a 400 percent increase in drastic alcohol-containing hand infection in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgian Toxicity Data Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Toxic Information Center, the cases of detoxification to the Toxic Information Centers in children under 12 years of age increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them falls on the daylight,” Lopez told CNN.
She said that some children are drinking the disinfectant intentionally, while some want to make an impact on their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube in which teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap boiling.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the desinfectant with an alcoholic bottle to get a stronger drink.
A pleasant smell of the disinfectant may attract younger children.
“The child doesn’t think that’s bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are those that are added to the smell.
There are pepper, grapefruit and orange-sweetened disinfectants that are very attractive to children's minds.
The hand desinfectant can contain alcohol between 45 and 95 percent.
Especially in small children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
“It’s really a compressed alcohol,” Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital’s Toxic Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don’t let the whiskey lay on the table, but the hand infection is left visible, and if the children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who a while ago swallowed only four injections of corn in the school with hand desinfectants, and she was taken to first aid for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the boundary of adult drunk, says Chris Ritchey, a first-help clinic doctor who treated her at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah stopped speaking and couldn’t walk when he arrived at first aid.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for potential brain disorders, as alcohol led the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant towels and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a hand desinfectant containing a toxic, unnoticed ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methane, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern state of New York, three four-class students planned to poison their "light" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, the police reports.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand desinfectant and banned it from his class.
The police have to prevent the plan as a “reveal scam” and leave the disciplinary measures to the school district.
CELTIC: There is no conflict
Griffiths fewer speeches about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila acknowledges that Hoops is in a strict position, but she makes it turn
Hearts is fighting against the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's accusations, and Warburton is guarding for January's scores that may interfere with the team's unity.
Dons raised his leadership to Celtic to five points
The punishment battle of Adam Rooney in the first half led Aberdeen to a narrow victory against Hamilton at the Pittodria Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference to Celtic's five points.
Griffiths Reduce Speech on Conflict
There have been rumors about Celtic's internal contradictions, but Griffiths passed them immediately. He claims that he and his team colleagues do not have any sense of working under more detailed care as the team is preparing to encounter the Dutch series leader.
I think we are not under pressure, I think the players are waiting for a meeting.
The lack of the Scottish championship is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfield player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: "The Celtic's high points are no longer shown in the Netherlands and why?"
Rangers are not involved.
People here can’t just talk about the return of Rangers.
They are talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and they are interested in it.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and also other than Scots want to follow those games.
Deila swears to turn the situation around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League followed rapidly the loss to the ten men played Aberdeen, who is now on the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said, “Celtic has had bad seasons before, and we’re going to rise again.”
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are well, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are so, but we have to continue.
We really need supporters because it improves players’ performance.
It is important to stay together.
Warburton announces January transfer of players
Although Mr. Rangers Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible goals of January's player transfers, he is warning of the worst, insisting that he doesn't want to confuse the team's consensus.
Former Brentford boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For future players in the summer, the time of adjustment is a time ahead of the whole, which is visible in our team this season.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more harm.
Celtic's interest point Michu indicates retirement
Swansea attacker Michu, whose name is attached to the transfer window in connection with Celtic, has indicated that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old player has been with nicking disorders for two years, and he failed to find a new companion outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight against the Scottish Football Federation because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost after 3-2.The defendant's red card was repealed later, and this was already the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was repealed.
Neilson stands behind his message, saying, “I have not questioned honesty, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was shocked after being admitted to singing an offensive song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was a moment of mind,” the attacker said, adding, “It’s safe to say that I’m not going back to Tynecastle, unless you’re going to play Celtic.”
Tannadice government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United’s government still believes in the lead team’s ability to turn the situation around, but acknowledges that the degradation of players must end.
“I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’re going to get the boys back,” Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy with the “small victory” in Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his team, Aberdeen, disappointedly took part in the game against Hamilton Accies, but succeeded Adam Rooney's first half-time punishment score to reach his seventh consecutive league win that raised them to the top of the table with five points above Celticia.
McInnes says: “There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a cup or a league that would not have won games in this way.”
Scotland’s unemployment rate remains the same as the UK’s overall growth rate
Employment in Scotland remained in 164 000 people in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole UK rose by 10,000 people to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9 percent higher than the UK’s 5.5 percent, according to the National Statistical Center (ONS).
At the same time, the unemployment rate in Scotland decreased by 12,000 people over the three-month period, and the number of employees is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent over the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has decreased.
Why I witness the execution in Oklahoma
If any legal interference does not occur, later today I will see when the man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope that’s not, I’m sitting in the audience’s newspapers in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watching when Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I’ve begun this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
The journalists, of course, have the opportunity to track the executions in America, and since there are often more applications than free places, the participants are selected through a shameful assessment.
Oklahoma has reduced media spaces from 12 to 5.
Anyone who chooses to see the event is cool.
I can’t do it.
I’m going to sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I’ve also established my own contact with him through the calls made over the months, as well as one two and a half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I must not have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I have seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter that I was blamed for my impartiality.
Here is the teaching.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants, so you get to participate.
I chose a journalist.
He admitted that “he could have put his word better,” but he still believes that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreeed with some of my messages and things I wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I'm going to write, and I won't do it even if he says.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the death penalty anti-trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I will not go through all the details again.
I can’t say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him in any case guilty of aid.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I am sure there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And that’s the point of view from which I see him dying.
I can’t say I’m totally unpartial.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
From me you will get a description of how it feels to look when the man I love dies unnecessarily.
A man was pulled out of the Canning River after a police officer
Canning Valen's counterplay remained dry when he attracted the man out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to deceive the police was wrong when he found himself in a low, distant water just a meter away from a police officer who tried “to gently pull him back to the beach.”
Canning Valen police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday due to unauthorized penetration.
When they found the suspect, he tried to deceive them by directing the Canning River.
However, he did not get far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I’m not going out, come to catch me,’ said the elderly superhero Shandell Castledine.
Constapel Lachlan Perhavec didn’t want his uniform to grow, so he used a safer tactic: “a good police negotiation.”
“Sometimes people do funny things while trying to escape,” said Castledine, a senior superman.
Football champion Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned their car to avoid flooding and tried to swim over the Swan River.
He failed in his business, but inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says reporters have tried to spy him and threatens to stop the competition
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victorian agents tried to infiltrate a spy into his stores last year, and threatens to stop the competition immediately.
He accuses the officers and the Racing Victorian Immortality Division of claiming that they have a personal campaign ongoing against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tata's late rejection due to the child's day-to-day treatment was the last thread.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what’s best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar’s unexplained positive kobolt show.
He has kept his tongue in investigation for a year and a half about spyware claims and did not want him to “appear jealous.”
"I didn't intend to say anything about it, and I've been silent about it for a long time, but sometimes it's so frustrated that everything disappears at once," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with penalties, and I have to live with what I have said.
I go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk my head straight and I want the owners to think that I will do my best in front of them.
When they begin to think differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach.
Then I should consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody spotted the bomb in an interview with the racing.com site, where he said the intelligence department had tried to spy his studio.
“First and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man – I’ll call him when I asked him – and offered him a job for my talks if he would transmit information about what I’m doing there.
They clearly consider me a trick.
If that’s the case, it’s usually good for them to dismiss their lawyer because they’ve failed to click on me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, were all aware of it at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I begin to think that this will become personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and transfer responsibility to other than coaches about what’s going on in the field?
Are we harmful to this sector?
Is it so harmful for me?
Maybe people think that way.
Per they have to take my license and push me away, and I don’t doubt at all whether the things I say now might cause them to think about it.
But I'm now at the point that I don't care anymore, and it will sadden me.
It really hurts me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back to it.
The trainer’s frustration has grown with the long-term Lidar’s kobolt investigation, and the late rejection has led him to find that he could “rush his license over the table.”
Moody, which is best known for training the unbeatable champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of the day-to-day treatments to be “laughed” after a mute or save is placed on the horse's legs, which is irregular.
“It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put it on the foot.
It could have been a tomb last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was on the day.
The model may be faced with a three-month competition prohibition due to child-day tomb treatment, from which the suppliers started the investigation.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Traffic driver arrested in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic escape after he crashed with his cyclist on a weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by flight to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was seriously injured when a car crashed with him on the Murray Valley road on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the wounded cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, neglecting assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL Rugby League championships that his team's tracks are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges would allow Storm to “weight” on his side when he suddenly won the final race in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was hardly troubled to hide his reference to the Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening in the final race. Bennett called the match the rugby league a “test window” and said that two Queensland teams were not “a lot excited” about the pressure.
Bellamy defended his team’s assassinations and said they’re just focusing on “contact” in the assassination.
Bellamy added that his confidence added the criticism of the two leading coaches against Stormy, as it means they are afraid to lose to the team.
“It’s always going to be a talk – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson’s talk about pressing when we lost 24-2 to them,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year. Over the last six weeks we have just emphasized the contact in the blocks, and it has made us succeed.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock for him.
It’s funny to see how this is always a talk of this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett’s idea of “an exciting rugby” by reminding his mentor that Bennett’s trained St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing “in a row.”
Wayne talks about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday evening game with our Friday evening games and tell us how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said it could not be less concerned.
But now he has a team that is able to play such a rugby that we consider exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play this game when you have the kind of players.
He brought it out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
I feel more confident when they say such things because they are slightly worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think of us as an opposition to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Rooster was more pisterious than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good game, I haven’t seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it an exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting violation of the defence line and leaving the goal?
This is a matter of guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm will be free this weekend because they’ve already won the right to the home game either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks against the next Saturday evening in the AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
200,000 Dollar Guarantee for Drugs
A man who is threatened by a possible lifecycle from a company holding 40 kilograms of cocaine misleading in Queensland has been released for a $200,000 guarantee.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who were arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 pounds of drugs for the Solay jade, who arrived in South America through the Vanuatu and dropped in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other accused in the port all the morning, and then he met them in the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 pounds of drugs from the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic threatens a possible lifecycle of the company holding a cocaine number intended for business, his lawyers claimed there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the whole amount in his possession, and that he could be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was worried that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
He has a strong connection with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maksimovic lie to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovich's mother and father together had offered a $200,000 guarantee to ensure his release.
“According to the arbitrary certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a $200,000 guarantee amount is a real financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he would give up both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police every day and keep his foreign movement ban between the afternoon and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to ask for photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl as she was asleep with this phone and then logged in to a networking service where Hogg received numerous untouched pictures of the children that another user sent to her.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping from Hogg's hand.
The girl looked at the phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, investigated the computers on the site, and found “threatening” web searches with search words that had been used to search for untouched images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this “to catch pedophiles” on the internet before he “prove to be a police to scare them.”
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court the following: “He said it was addiction – that he’s dependent on intimidating people.
He admitted that he had performed the funeral on a computer but said that they were made just because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to be able to torture pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he did this only for the purpose of introduction.
She said she’s getting sick after drinking, and she wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed to her mother, trembled and cried.
The mother saw the untouched pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she said the accused had used the computer and PlayStation to talk to the girls who looked younger to her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lived on Ward Road in Dundee, acknowledged his guilt on June 14 of last year for making or taking pictures of untouched children. He violated his guarantees on January 25 of this year and refused to come to trial on March 24 of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hoggia not to be included in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be claimed that his crime did not belong to “a significant sexual element.”
Seriffi Alistair Carmicheal delayed the sentence to October so that the social action had time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this story, but in other ongoing stories he is arrested before the processing.
He was included in the register of sexual crimes before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe made a false speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, former African leader Mugabe fell on the leading stairs.
She was not injured, but the video of the fall was spread by the virus on social media.
Parliament's opening was also distorted by the allegations of opposition lawmakers that anonymous murders were sent to them, warning them of buying Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they bushed and interrupted him with interruptions while he held a speech on the state of the country to the parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group curator Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages from their mobile phones warning them of disturbing Mugabe's speech.
“The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the title of the message is ‘death’,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warned the members concerned that the immunity will end in Parliament, and when they go out, the parliamentary immunity will not be valid.
The group’s supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “threatened” of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and consumption efforts in the business service business.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two stock marketed companies, distinguishing its computer and printer business from the faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected job breaks will bring about $2.7 billion in expenses from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring actions will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s Chairman and CEO, who leads the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help move to a new type of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the emerging needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it’s “focused on producing uncomparable integrated technology solutions” for companies, the company said in a statement.
Jako dissolves the company that Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage located in Palo Alto, known as “the birthplace of the Hidden Valley”.
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to overcome the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies are doing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team members have to support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb match.
Wenger has also emphasized to Wilshir that now it’s just September and assuming that he’s going to recover according to plans, there’s no reason he’d not be playing again until Christmas.
In this best case, even Wilshere will be out of at least four of the next English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The greatest regret in this last problem is that the end of Wilshere's last season was strong after a single nickname, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
“These injuries do not threaten a career,” Wenger said.
It is a bone that has not been healed properly.
It is nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It is not related to his nails or previous injuries that he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return between through there is always the risk of additional injury.
There is also an uncomfortable model.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he has only played in 65 of Arsenal's 157 games.
Looking at the wider overall of Arsenal after the 2007-08 season, in six of eight seasons it has been one of the League teams that has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger gives him a chance, but Arsenal believes their last season improvement to the injury statistics will continue.
“Sometimes when we get back from the injury can be a vulnerable season when we need to strengthen our body and gain competition,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will be carried out as he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday afternoon against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday against Chelsea and on Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably at the start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a breath to the players who want it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up of the F League, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is the most scary in Europe.
Dinamo has not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own “Invincible” campaign last season.
The stadium was struck by a earthquake on Tuesday night with a magnitude of 3.2 Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned about the last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco, and is motivated by the still distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup win.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not wounders.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is astonishing how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open is more desperate than ever, and the suicide desires of young men are higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and is three times more common in men than in women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 as the Men’s Year. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed depressive symptoms. The study found that a person’s chances of recovery doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friend was “healthy.”
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the likelihood of developing potential mental health problems fell by half, if they had mentally healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this social media through the time of communication, the style goes through the content and the immediate response is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look strong, happy and successful, even though in reality isolation is dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - internal desire for personal growth and friendship - which affect deeper our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer immediately explained, money doesn’t really get greater happiness.
Frendien's greatness was that it turned this focus to the top.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joe's and Chandler's numerous cravings, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachelia - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As a Samaritan volunteer explained to me: “When I listened to people who are depressed and self-destruction, I really understood how little interaction with a friend can improve the condition.”
Often men who get in touch with us feel that they can’t talk to friends.
The old thought of “excedence” is strong, as well as the feeling that if you open up the problems, you are seen as weak.
Frendit is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival ways.
It emphasized the little moments of friendship between men.
Though unpartial, my external position on the other side of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And so if you’re taking part in Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the pictures are re-designed for the celebration, why would you take your friends to coffee in Central Perks.
Or, which is even better, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frends will be sent on Comedy Central from the start to the end, all 236 episodes, join #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes the painting and helps the PSG to shake the side of Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates matches against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored the goal in his Champions League debut, helping PSG overcome the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
The match and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal in his Champions League debut in less than four minutes, showing the way to the French champions, but the team lost several opportunities before they eventually increased their advance in Cavan's hit the goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, which is in the same A class with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as the game had not only a continuation, but also an improvement in their quarterfinals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took points, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost his place in front of the goal and later was exchanged from the field. Malmö is his old home city team and the team in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in the hosts, so the 2-0 win will cause problems to the opponent and look good in statistics, and it’s a good start, even if there are things we’re going to break this season,” Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret we didn’t get one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes made after the team stayed 2-2 in the Ligue 1 home match against Bordeaux in the weekend, but he remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine law enemy was named as a man that leads the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he witnessed why when he ran Marco Verratti unhealthy behind the Malmö defense line and then hit a beautiful finish through Johan Wiland to the back of the network.
However, if someone expected a simple and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a big opponent. It won in Celtic's resolution when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and fifth defense as well as two players in the deep middle field.
But the team did not offer much more on the offensive side than the shot of Nikola Djurdzic in the 34th minute, which passed a knit over Kevin Trapp's painting track.
Instead, the PSG was sometimes lacking due to lost input and poor finish, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half only and then deceived when Cavani put the ball into the touch of Ibrahimovic right at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in making the showwork to his colleagues, and just after Ibrahimovic’s eating, Di Maria sent the tour of the tour, which wrapped around the Wiland painting track at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally achieved an hour after the season's sixth goal, thanks to Uruguay-like Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had scored forward from Maxwell's crossover left.
It ended with Malmö’s wishes to get back into the game, and only Wiland’s brilliant fight against David Luiz’s direct defeat kept the final numbers down before the exchanged Ezequiel Lavez’s paint was rejected right at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was equally higher than his team. The Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.”
After that, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Cardio matches are not enough.
I put my hat in Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore gathers $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Switzerland mining industry left Glencore, who suffered from the price collapse of basic goods, gathered $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its widespread debt plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion to cut its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with crashing basic goods prices as the slowdown of the Chinese economy burns demand and causes destruction on all markets.
The new marking raised the value of Glencore’s shares to the top on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The shares rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pounds in the FTSE 100 index, which broke 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had previous week revealed a $2.5 billion stock trade as part of its wider plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital for 125 pounds of the share, meaning a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday’s decision price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, the total value of which was 9.99 percent of the association.
The concerns about China’s long-lasting growth stagnation have cut the prices of iron mole to approximately half, and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other goods have fallen by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China's President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House's statement published on Tuesday confirmed.
Xin's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's last November visit to Beijing, the statement said.
U.S. President and President's wife Michelle Obama will host a dinner for X and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will give an opportunity to expand the cooperation between the United States and China in numerous common-interest global, regional and bilateral matters, and at the same time it will give President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively matters in which there are disagreements,” the statement added.
On the visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to move in Seattle on his trip to Washington to meet numerous U.S. technology leaders before he continues to New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged online spacecraft and the country’s increased unconditionality in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon to Reduce Difference in Filming
Matt Damon met with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown when they discussed the diversity that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In HBO's Sunday-Night Project Greenlight episode, an experienced actor stopped Brown's doing this by emphasizing the need for different perspectives regarding the dark character of the project-selected manuscript.
“When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series,” Damon said.
Shoked Brown reacted to the injured unbelievably, with the comments “Oho! Wow. Ok”, while the comments of the actor of The Martian remained in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think, whatever director they are, how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark figure is a bear whom his white pair hits.
The Dear White People's producer claimed the film's directing rights to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied boringly that their directing "may end up giving us something we don't want."
When the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to annoy Damon's comments.
MrPooni, a Twitter user, said: “Matt Damon speaks about the only dark-shaped person in the room and explains the difference to him is THAT WHITE that he hurt.”
After its publication, the tweet collected more than 5,000 re-interviews and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments touch the time when a precise racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the white police murdered teenager Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop the practices that discriminate colourful people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the show when he presented the nominations for the Year's Album as the Grammy Prize winner.
“Albums are still important,” he said.
Like in books and black lives, albums are still of importance.
The head of the Black Lives Matter movement recently issued a statement to answer Fox News television broadcaster Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question whether the group should be considered a hostile group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was that Damon was involved among entertainers, producers and media collectors who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior
Isaac Caldier became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and received a million-dollar prize.
In its seventh season, there has never been a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the program’s esterada.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task was to climb about a 23-metre corner in 30 seconds.
The British first climbed and solved the challenge in time, making him the first athlete of all time to find the American Ninja Warrior's overwhelming fourth quarter. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hardly achieved win and was still shocked by winning the $1 million main prize.
“There’s a great thing to think about when I’ve never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his great wage increase.
So suddenly... so I can’t even imagine what this will be... the future is unknown.
Production chief Kent Weed went on to discuss The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why the British don’t get more reward money, although he’s the first ever competitor to pass the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money gets the one who has the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, it still gets a great feeling of satisfaction.
I don’t think he feels good for that.
He is so happy that he has done what he has done.
His fans have praised him.
He is a great guy and a good parent.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone had to win me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the opposite way.
The American Ninja Warrior returns to its eighth season, with premiums starting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers cross Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been very fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers perfectly played their role as a thunder on Tuesday when they won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to rise to the end of the game from Houston Astros in a competition for another wild card place in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was at least one night for a return to the six-letter H-word pair, which was very difficult to reach for most of the season's second half.
“All the victories are fun, no matter how they get,” said Tigers’ team manager Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers feedman Alfredo Simon continued his early attack as Detroit ran three times in the first two turns, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) eaten 6 1/3 in a curve and allowed three runs.
This was his third quarter in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong end for this year,” Simon said.
The exchange is difficult to enter each game, and therefore I want to go deeper into the game.
The Tigers locator Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first hits in his race after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-shot night after he hit fourth against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
“He wrapped the paint well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good (in shooting exercises), looked significantly better in shooting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh round, and that was their best chance to get back into the game.
Sentter Byron Buxton started the diarrhea by shooting twice out to the left side of the field.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks came home with a one-base spell, and Simon was burned directly by the second-base player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with the left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked to Mauer, the only player opposed, to Miguel Sano, who was starting in front of a two-way run to the left of Drew VerHagen.
While two runners were on the field and the balancing runners on the double, VerHagen got the three-point Trevor Plouffen to hit the double-game leading painting.
This was the main record: the 27th time in this season when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had received a secure race at the ninth start, Mauer would beat two hits against the Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
The right-wing player, however, burned Sano in three spots in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used Phil Hughes for the first time.
The Tigers received three runs in the first two runs against the right veteran player who escaped from the list of injured before the game after being out for more than a month due to infection in the lower leg.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want such a start,” Hughes said, “but as the game advanced, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I got done in the third round with a few comfortable entries.”
After Hughes knocked on the first bowl, he gave the second bowl to the player Ian Kinsler to advance between one.
The walking of J.D. Martinez on the right side in a two-fire situation led to a hit battle for Victor Martinez, who took himself on the middle side to the first place and caused the game's first run.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21-track while the runner was in good running stations.
The three-time player Nick Castellanos continued to beat to the right and cause a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected as he tried to move forward to the three-time.
The Tigers continued in the second turn and got one shot, two bats in the situation of running the kidnapping James McCann and two bats in the situation of running the center Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
“It was an important blow,” Twins team manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn’t hit very well, but it flown to the right place.
Hughes began to be in the food shake and ate the runless third diary, after which he was replaced by the right-wing followers A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs of six shots and walked with four fires.
NOTE: The Tigers' right-hand feedman Anibal Sanchez was caught away because of the shoulder's swelling on the shoulder.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who played Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured since mid-August because of a shoulder, but he had to return on Wednesday.
As Sanchez is out, the left-wing Daniel Norris comes from the list of injured to start fighting against Twins.
Norris’ statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after the left-wing David Price was exchanged with him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to the right wave of the abdominal bladder.
The three games of Tigers and Twins will end on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota's right-wing enthusiast Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open the economy to the wider world
The economy needs to be more opened to the external world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday that the task is to guide the reform.
“China should commit to attracting foreign financing and expertise and developing transparency policies,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the lead group to deepen publicity.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are being pushed forward will increase new movement and vitality, as well as create a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Board of Directors adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of restricting access to the market, the dissolution of the principles of border inspection, the invitation of state-owned enterprises to seize private capital, and the review of the residential registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, naming those sectors and companies in which it is not allowed to invest.
The system is gradually tested and improved by experimental programs.
The change must be significant, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a law-based business environment and makes the market more transparent.
The government also relieves its control to the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide themselves how to manage their business activities.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open state-controlled sectors to private funders, more sectors are opened.
“The government will not change its orientation regarding foreign investments, and it will protect the legitimate interests of companies funded by foreigners and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
Furthermore, the search process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, the “green card”, is facilitated by optimizing requirements and facilitating the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of law enforcement rights for lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, along with senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement published after the meeting.
