Hunted in the World
The marketing journey Looks Like You Need Iceland has gone well out and the crowds and calls out in nature are going to get into people widely and widely around the world.
“You own the coal, I need Iceland,” said a woman somewhere outside the big world in a commentary on the advertisement from the marketplace Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another attentive greeting will preserve Iceland in her heart forever and a young woman says immediately has to come who first to Iceland ends with her abandoned residence there.
For all the unfortunate, however, she is in the United States and suggests that you have to wait for a few months yet.
Another audience asks if the route to Iceland is possible, because there are no aircraft.
It doesn’t follow the story if he comes from a second season.
Egill Toddarson at the Peel Advertising Conference, which made the ads along with the international M&C Saatchi Advertising Conference, said the responses have been hopeful for further.
“I’ve come to many Inspired By Iceland trips that have gone very well, but this new triumph is already finished.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it is getting foreign media to talk about the warfare, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively dramatic time, we have received a summary in about seven hundred media around the world that reached the realm of two billion people.
The value of this sum is estimated at 1.8 billion kronor.
It is not amalgamatic.”
The main market of all is the United States and the military has gone very well at the end although the Americans are not on the way to the country in advance.
According to the history of Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany are also well-accepted, such as Russia, which came quite surprised.
Then there was a response from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specially addressed with.
“These ads have traveled beyond us,” says Egill, but it may be that more than four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t wish a better start.”
The videos at the opening took Aaron Sæberg, the photographer of the Morning Gazette, with ticks on the ads with the title “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The shows were broad and broad, such as at the School Course in Reykjavik, in Reynisfjöru, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökli and in helli at Hjörleifshöfda.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions and producer Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles in the theme were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Ungverjalandi.
The Turks of Iceland came to make the advertisements but at the same time as the collections came out in the South was another group in the West and the West.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland tour but is scheduled to be a winter tour in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase in this work for Icelandic Office,” says Egill, adding that the partnership with M&C Saatchi has gone well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such a project, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the meanings we are talking about.”
Explosive: Riding the position on the labour market, life risks and much more
Deputy Minister of Social and Childhood, Einar Daedason, meets in Sprengisand which starts at 10 p.m. today.
He is also a labour market minister and discusses the situation on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more issues.
He also discusses agriculture and transportation works out to a country that has gone badly and has been divided over the past years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, VR’s chairman, also met in the event but he will discuss his concerns about life-related investments and raises ideas about the fact that economic growth and employers are pulling out of the management of the sectors to reduce the risk of interests.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar Ingimarsson, a travel service officer in Austria, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdottur, the chief executive of the Northern Market Office, on the status of the travel service in the countryside.
They will look forward in the autumn and see if the success of the summer is a promising prediction of what will come.
You can listen to the episode below but it starts at 10 p.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a father-in-law career in youth games of any kind.
He played for his role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
A little bit has bore on her recently but she nevertheless breaks to look over the way and talk about Clueless in the Australian TV on the days.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the character mostly on the girls I met in school that were not good to me.
As I read the script, I knew who this character was,” Donovan said about his game at Clueless.
He didn’t want to leave the police after night shooting.
About fifty cases arrived on the police board in the capital area today and says in the police’s journal that the cases have been diversified.
The day at the police station in Hverfisgötu began with the fact that the police had to have a dismissal of a man who had recently been released from the prison after having suffered this due to an increase in fuel.
The man didn’t want to go away after he was released and didn’t listen to the police who told him to go to the crash.
The man sees a continuing shock at the police station because of his outbreak.
The man was arrested in the morning on the grounds of an assassination in a company in Copenhagen.
The police also had to have two men detained in Breiðholti due to reports of body injuries.
Then it also happened that a woman who was placed in a shopping center in Copavogi could not pay for the account at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A truck was also in the centre of the city this morning.
The driver of the Renault aircraft car was searching for her for a moment and she was then taken free hand.
The car has not been found.
The Disappearance of the Happiness - The Horrible Destiny of the Glorious Stars
The doctrine has reached the Internet to a breakthrough of rest over the participation on the Happiness, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and became there with the third main components to leave life far before the ages.
The theme of the joy (e. Glee) is a popular show about singing, dancing and joy.
The subjects discussed the so-called joy of young people in school, their aspects and their fate.
It was not always taken out with the honour to be in the joy, but through the song and dance the characters of the participants seemed to survive any of the circumstances that came up in their lives.
But outside the scenery, great disturbances have been directed over the actors and staff of the parties, so much that the doctrines have awakened about the disturbance of the rest on the parties.
Naya Marie Rivera went with the role of Santönu Lopez in the performances, a filmmaker who didn't call all his mother.
After the show had its scale, Rivera went to the actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and divorced them in the aftermath.
Dorsey, however, refused to submit a friend and the household case was laid down.
On July 8, it was that River was missing after her four-year-old son was found alien on a boat on Lake Pira in California.
The boy was found asleep in a guard bed around the boat, and he was able to report to the police that he and his mother had stumbled and that Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never gave up there himself.
A large-scale search for Rivera.
The day after the search, the police officer in the area began to report that the search was gone out of the fact that Rivera had been drunk.
Five days later, Rivera was found and the dead was officially identified.
It is believed that she has fallen into a great storm in the water and renewed her last effort to save the son.
The Danish was recorded drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith went with the role of Finn Hudson in the events, the American footballer with the English speaker who played a key role in bringing the Good Luck to the way and respect.
Without the implications, Moneith, however, fell with a personal devil.
From the age of 13, he had been hunted with a puppy and found it difficult to get out of her.
In 2013, his colleagues in the field found enough to come, interfered with him and called him to seek help.
Moneith got them in treatment and seemed to look better.
Just two months after he started treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
The banana has been shown to be a banal mixture of alcohol and alcohol.
It was not said that it was about will.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance for anemia had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated well, proved prohibited.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His commitment was loud to his colleagues, but by the submission of his counterpart, Lea Michele, was determined to keep the commitments closed and consecrated the entire participation in the memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling went with the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the performances, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and received a little respect for his fellow members in the Glory, or all until he got the heart to admit that he singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on the grounds of kidnapping.
At his home, a remarkable amount of infancy was found and the case was soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling was already there.
He was sentenced and sentenced for his offense.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison in addition to having to be registered for sexual assault and seeking treatment for childhood.
Before the judge had judged the punishment, Salling, who was then free against the insurance, was found dead near his home.
The Danish is self-sufficient.
It was not just the actors of the roles that fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director.
He was injured in sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
There was also a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the great star, Juliu Roberts, and her sister didn’t have the famous story, but she told Roberts about great governance and annoying appearance.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she suffered a severe depression.
She received a letter to her sister where she chose her mother and sister among other things to be responsible for how it came to her.
“My mother and my so-called sisters get nothing behind me except the remembrance that they were the ones who suffered my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star.
She has recently been sought to use her fellow solitary and transition to the field and to be with transitional stars.
Jesse Luken went to the show in 2012.
He was arrested and injured for oil crash in 2019, which suffered a lot of trouble.
The actress Heather Morris played a great role in the events.
It was because in 2010 unprotected computer drivers came into net videos of her and published on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner fell in both episodes and had a love relationship outside the episodes.
It was later that Jenner used her violence in the relationship.
You can put a flower on almost everything.
It increases the growth of the children when they get to play out in the garden with the parents to grow flowers and get to follow them grow and grow.
It is also permanently possible to do with flowers as the Danish photographer Anna Kubel tells on.
Just spending time with the kids in the garden is something you never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the light and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Buying a boat after 10 boats
“I think we’re not a lot of sailors working at the country’s sports universities,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who travels on the beach in the summer while studying psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter time.
The beaches are a very comfortable summer job when a man is in arrival.
If you’re fishing well, you can have good profits and I think it’s great to be able to give up taking a degree.
The results also bring me well into the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychiatrist who travels on the beach in the summer as the last few.
Axel was the newest to browse in Talknaheng when a journalist got the news of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.”
“When I was ten years old, I took the boarding rights for two under twelve meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I graduated.
I’ve seen beach roads on my bed all a few years ago.
I bought the boat used by my knowledge, Hartmann Jonssyni, and I let the boat call his name.
Hartmann became mature when I bought the boat and stopped being on the sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million dollars.
“I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay the half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the half at the end of the summer when I had been hunting.
So I had the boat debt to him at the end of this first summer.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out when he had newly graduated?
“I’ve been giving up and collecting money, I’ve been working with my father to the sea when I was a boy, I’ve been all a few hunting with him and got my thing.
I also put my boats in my boat."
Axel is born in Isak, where all his motherhood is, but he has lived in Copenhagen since he was a boy.
“I can hunt here in the western region because I have a legal place with my grandmother in Iceland.
I learned in this area here in the west of the roads with my father.
I take myself between the distances according to how I feel, because this fishing area approaches the whole West.
Although I think it’s best to be for the West, I’ve also offered around the Snæfellsness and beyond.
I’ve also given for the sun, but I’ve preferred a grassleep,” says Axel, who always touches one firefighter in the morning and says sometimes speaks to the maven and sings for the sky, in the same time together on the balloon.
“The network outside the sea is good, so I can call, listen to show and music.
I don’t think I’m alone in the bed.
Of course, I’m trying to avoid landing in a hassle, but some time something has been in the weather, but never a great danger,” says Axel, who is lucky with that he’s never sick.
He tells the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.
“In the beach, I’m never more than 14 hours on the fishing at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental, but then I’ve been joined in one and a half sunlight in the use out of the sea to fishing.”
The prediction in the beach is that he is so that he can hunt 770 pounds a day, which he feels happy.
“The other thing is that I cannot hunt on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and I can only hunt twelve days a month, this four months that the beaches stand over, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, the sailors should choose their hunting days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to rush instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their heads.
So the area shift could go too because of me and the seawars that are well located near the fishing area should have to enjoy it,” says Axel, who draws most of the sea from the salty sea on their beach roads, but also just off and unique other species fast with.
Axel works over the winter time with his college at the Nupi School in Copenhagen.
“I don’t think we’re a lot of sailors working at the country’s sports schools,” Axel said proudly adding that he had only intended to work timely at the sports school.
“I’m surprised because I think this is a wonderful job.
I hope that psychiatrics will be used to me in the game class in the future,” says Axel, who is also a long-standing graduate in business science.
The villa in registration prevented the arrival
The villa in the registration board that people fill out when it comes to the country became that the individual, resident here in the country, was not called back to the showcase.
There is no requirement to register the lesson if the applicant fills the deadline out in English, as is when it is done in Spanish.
“This will be examined this week,” says a specialist at the countryside countryside.
Three internal meetings were investigated at the National Medical Center yesterday.
One of those who proved positive arrived in the country on 15 July, two days after the rules on such retirement entering into force.
Those who stayed in Iceland were then scheduled for arrival in the country and returned to the showcase four to five days later.
In the afternoon, it was revealed that the incident would have followed the old system.
The show at the border was negative and he was not called back to the show.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the emergency area of the countryside, says in an interview with the news agency that this could cause errors in the electronic recording board.
Fill people out the registration table in English is not a condition to put in the tutorial like and is in the Icelandic version.
However, it was primarily thought for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the applicant has not received an automatic invitation to come to the showcase.
Kamilla says many have followed the rules of homeland permission although they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases the employers have also been awake for sending people to the showcase back after it arrived in the country.
“This will be examined this week how it can facilitate people’s access to this to awaken their attention to the process.”
The man is alone and six have been placed in a police station.
They all went to the show but two were going to show the signs.
The infection is now ongoing with the three infections detected yesterday but it is mostly ended due to two infections detected on Friday.
In both cases, the original analysis of the Icelandic Heritage Agreement has shown that there is a variety of coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In the second case, the land has been directed to Israel although it is known that the person who moved the veil to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says it should be for tomorrow where the other weather would come from.
All are now 15 in individual according to the website COVID. is.
135 are on board.
Four out of five missed
Five domestic events have occurred here in the past few days.
Four of them are uninterrupted and the source of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup competition yesterday has not been found.
The scratch is still overwhelming.
Originally, they were sent individually in the third week but they were grown in the sixteenth.
In total, 34 people are in death due to the new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that the infection is noticed on a sports event and has raised questions about whether there is no such event.
Johann K. Johannsson, the chief communications officer of the National Security Council, says it very easily, as long as people follow the terms and rules.
“We are constantly warning to all those who live here that it needs to keep up with individual infections.
We also need to advise for people who are keeping an event that there are certain rules in the process that need to follow.
Then you can keep an event,” says John.
He says that infection can be prevented by keeping the individual infection in the air.
The rules and conditions are in constant review.
“What we need to do, and what the public health and agricultural health care are constantly burning for people, is considering these individual infections.
Both home companies and the same way with service companies.
People washed their hands and tasted.
It will prevent the infection from going on,” says John.
“We need to encourage people to continue the good journey we were in, so that we can keep up with the success we have achieved here.”
40% of victims of COVID-19 were diabetes mellitus
Devon Brumfield heard during the phone how hard her father had to reach the spirit.
Her father was suffering from diabetes and she called him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The breath was caused to an immediate detection problem due to coronavirus infections.
Diabetes was attributed to the bottom floor as the underlying valve and Brumfield, who is also diabetes, is afraid to die as much as to go away.
Reuters news agency says the fear of Brumfield is not justified.
A recent study by U.S. authorities has shown that 40% of those who died were with diabetes 2 as a underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who have not reached the age of 65 is examined, the percentage increases by half.
A study by the U.S. Military Security Authority (CDC) attended more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who are diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their disorders.
It was a fall in the high, Reuters allowed to do an investigation and point out the answers from those 12 states that responded to the relative proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet to report the underlying disease.
“The sickness was already drowned in a high level.
Now COVID-19 has broken down as a powerful age,” says Elbert Huang, Chairman of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among black and people of South American origin, which has also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best safeguards for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the diseases in boundaries with body weight, full diet and health care assistance.
However, the Korean Air Force has made it difficult for many in a week to keep the Russian.
Then the high price of insulin has taken the number to continue to meet in the work and risk therefore to be exhausted for the scene.
Reuters reports that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the threat that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
As the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them were affected and in the 2009 swine disease, these groups were three times more likely to have to go to a hospital.
When MERS did this in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were placed in a gas was diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that due to the effect of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the disease has suffered the gap of a number of previously unknown followers.
“I’m afraid that we’ll see the flow of problems when this is over,” says Andrew Bolton, the head of the Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus disorder can in an immeasurable way lead to increases in associated diabetes, including newborn diseases and newborn diseases.
As direct new research to the fact that coronavirus can lead to a number of diabetes problems.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus occurs on the heart, lungs and new, bodies that are already sick for many people with diabetes.
Therefore, a high rate of glucose and lipid in diabetes may cause the so-called “substance” as it is called when the immune body agits too hard to the body.
Infectious inflammation can also lead to pneumonia, which again can cause unavoidable blood clots.
“It’s all a big game,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all related.”
The press has been corrected.
“When the camp was invited, they left the room.”
The marriage of Asrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason came with that unusual bode from the filmmaker Ragnari Kjartanssyni to have sex in front of the cameras for the works that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so that it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets that when he met his wife and childbirth, Asruuna Magnosdott, for the first time.
“I was very pleased with her.
It was, of course, just the disappointment, but it also seemed to me quite unhealthy.
And he’s still suffering,” he says.
If this ends, the husband will regularly make the first meeting.
“I always hear this story.
Last week only,” she said, who also spoke to her husband at the first date.
“I found and felt such a great sensation around Atla that I thought.
A lot is going on and a lot is going on and I’m healed.”
Atli says that the spouses have focused on it in their relationship to go their own paths.
“We do not bind our bag to the same nodes and communicators.
We need the roots that we are talking about around us.”
There is probably the reason why they took the memory of the Ragnari Kjartanssyni filmmaker just celebrating, even if it would be said to be unusual.
“Christine Anna, our joint friend, is contacting us and asks if we can come to eat a dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörgu wife Ragnars, on Snaps.”
They gave the invitation, met the triangle on Snaps and found desert wine and its reserve.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through their vision of a film show he thought to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
“He had a lot of videos called Scenes from western culture.
He explained it in a simple way.”
Asrún says he has described the work as a banal and decadent latter from the everyday life of Western nations.
“He had records of all the signs he intended to shoot and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in.”
The latter that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in the intention of showing young people to love in a minimalist room.
“These are coincidences with the beginning and the end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know much about Ragnar although they knew of him and he of them “but they knew us and found it suitable for us.
They said they didn’t want to advertise people.
Per they thought they’t get the right people but people who are sexually empowered by performing for others.”
They quoted Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter but it didn’t take a long time.
“When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘Isn’t we just in this?
It was just so.
I trust Ragnari as the player and all his team,” says Azrun and Atli undertakes.
“It’s about love and love.”
Later it was built in a fine apartment in the town.
There was a very popular film theme; a songwriter, Ragnar and a singer and a couple.
After the break had been on the collection of leaves all the room to wait out in the car except Atli and Asrun.
“We haven’t decided anything about how we should be.
We got a few instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
Be uninterested about what we would do and for whom.
There was nothing to play, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Asrún.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a little romantic,” says Atli and Asrún agree.
“They were invited to the camp before they left the room.
It was a little like being on a vacation at a nice hotel in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the progress of the couple in the work that moved to them.
“When Tommi’s master looked at this, he cried, he liked it so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s just as much about love and proximity and the relationship itself,” says Asrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and said Atli that his mother had heard the voice in the son at the Listasafni Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
“They’re going to go and go to it,” says Atli.
“My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t said this to anyone, but just then my father sends me a message and says, “It’s a pleasure to meet the little family in the Palais de Tokyo.”
And the planned participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ahrun and Atla?
“We’re still together so maybe it’s deepened something.
This, of course, deepened my connection with the connected family,” says Asrún and laughs.
He saw himself working in the Chamber of Commerce with his colleague.
“I found it a bit difficult not to be with you but with someone else,” she said and turned to her husband.
“But it was fun to see this because it’s just one later in a much larger work and when you see it with the other works it’s very nice.
I could take a little bit of it and was proud of it.
And there was a little bump in my stomach,” says Asrún who was unhealthy by the other child of the wives when the son was taken up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with the Asrune and Atla in the Astro Stories at Rase 1.
Swansea with victory in the previous round
Swansea won 1-0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first match of the teams in the last round of the game to get up in the English match.
The game took place at Swansea in Wales.
The position in the middle was 0–0.
In the 64th minute, Swansea's nationalists won a win, but Andre Ayew broke the balloon from the white point and left the defence away.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, the Brentford player, received the red ball.
Brentford then played the rest of the game man fewer and at the 82nd minute the players Swansea won the team.
Andre Ayew then added the ball by scoring a great goal and guaranteed Swansea 1–0 victory.
Swansea leads 1–0 in the match, but the next match starts on Wednesday at Brentford.
5 years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, an American broadcaster in Iceland, is in the crossing of the media after CBS tomorrow that he wanted to get a armed life where he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been uninterrupted for the President of the United States to send ambassadors here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst died from the post of the U.S. Ambassador in April 2009, it has been entirely detained in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst died of office under special circumstances, but Kastjós since 2009 that she had to receive the Falcaur Order.
On the way to a goodbye with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be affected by the word.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until the advocate Van Voorst came to work, in September 2010.
It could be somewhat to say that Robert S. Connan had been sent as an ambassador but stopped so.
With the work ended Loius Ariega had then worked in the foreign service for decades.
He then left his office in the autumn of 2013 and took office as an ambassador in Guatemala.
Then it took a second period of sending.
Robert Barber rushed the approval of the United States in January 2015 and came to work later, but then no sender had been on the site for 13 months.
Barber was a political officer but not a diplomate, but he had worked as a lawyer and a short election candidate for Barack Obama.
He died of work as soon as Donald Trump took office on the presidential session, January 20, 2017, as the usual is with a political shipped ambassador.
Trump’s administration was unusual to send both ambassadors and slowly put ambassadors into the Washington government system.
Therefore, it took two years until the U.S. invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to ask him the spots out and confirm the end as a sender to Iceland.
In his testimony, he said he had never arrived in Iceland but often in Western Europe, but his wife, who was killed, had been broken by the Dutch border.
Gunter is a political officer, was previously a physician in California and has been an investigative in the Jewish coalition of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The player Sheldon Adelson founded the association but Adelson is the accused supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no sender had been in the country since the beginning of 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest that examples are about here.
The reason is both how long Trump’s administration was attributing people to the key positions that and that in recent years the U.S. has been working very long, including believing to confirm a messenger in positions.
Since 2009 it has been sent to Iceland for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented the implementation on the way of the embassy that opened the new headquarters at Engjateig.
The investments are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion but the high-quality security walls surround the building and the shutdown is in every window.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill up the current sender’s security certificate because he’s said he’s afraid of his life and has wanted to get a armed life.
Previous articleIbV has been convicted of racism in Iceland – “There was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, said he had been racist when he was in Iceland and that he was looking forward to having arrived in the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny that appears on the Hungarian Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team playing in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country but he played with Ibv, Val and Troti in Iceland.
“When I arrived in Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's advantage was in that position but he was also with the triumph that I wanted to have so I didn't get anything of what I wanted," says Tonny but he played on the right side of the match with IBV.
Among what Tonny talks about is racism he became against in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many counterpart players will face when they play in Europe.
“It came to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was told to me.
Later I discussed the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent had left racist minds falling around me after I threw him.”
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He said he made the mistakes he saw the most.
Tonny hadn't been able to get into the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked him to go back to Iceland for a loan but he went to the team with Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland with a loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway then I would have the opportunity I wanted to get,” says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get longer.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made out of his dreams of coming to the Great in Europe.
Finding a serpent in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black bear in the midst of a woman looking there.
The doctor managed to pull the serpent out with a stick.
The research showed that there was a speech about an animal.
CNN reports this.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which is yours meat.
The woman beat soon after the wall was removed but the snorkelers on board with this are often in scary meat or fish.
After sushi broke into beds in the West, cases, in which snorkelers have lived in people, have multiplied to CNN's story.
Fear that another bullying will begin in Europe
Spain is now in a burning crisis in connection with concerns about another coronavirus burst in Europe, but there the government has taken action to anticipate the spread of coronavirus burst again.
In Catalonia, all the entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the smoke goes numerous.
Other European countries have even taken action due to the abundance of infection in Spain, but in Britain everyone has to go in a warranty with the arrival from Spain, like in Norway, and France has been warned of travel to Spain.
The conflict is also growing again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance in anticipating the spread of the world and bringing the economic life back.
The location in Europe is good compared to anywhere else in the world, but the world’s new infection reaches 300 thousand per day, where the most infection is estimated in America and South Asia.
According to the Johns Hopkins University, there are estimated 16 million infections worldwide, and 644 thousand deaths are confirmed to be linked to the virus.
Mosaic Works Maked Can Finally Enjoy To The Perfect
In front of the Tollhouse in Reykjavik is a large and deep hole.
On top there are men with an orange helmet.
There is also a grave.
And more mines.
The road is closed for traffic.
But the road is available and there are now many people staying and respecting a list of millions of mosquitoes — it seems that they’ve never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it didn’t seem to him.
The work has so far been somewhat flawed, right in front there were parking stations that were always carried out.
People placed there, dropped the car in a snorkeling and throwed out of the place to find their minds in the center of the city.
“Living and diversified public climate” and “extraordinary cities” are the guidelines for the re-establishment of the Security Guard that is now underway.
The goal is to cool the area and allow the mosquitoes to take a weekend at the Customs House to enjoy the view better.
In front of the work will be a square and since the area is well at the sun, it is considered to be a well-established area for passengers.
The listwork will be described and now the ingredient can enjoy better than before on this 142-meter plate.
In the area will also be small “shokes”, some kinds of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide the area with a certain dull.
In this way, the rebounds are described by the Reykjavik City which is being implemented along with Veitum.
Water, heat and electricity will be renovated.
Many of them come to their years, but the school records and cold water records are from 1925 and have served the residents and in the center for a decade.
When the road is reopened to the end, the cars can run around it again.
But it will still be unified and as soon as it creates a quiet and accessible room for walking.
In a statement on the Customs House on the website of the Customs Director says that the house was taken into use in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the failure reached through the house, 250 meters of windowless walls were formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such flows would have a negative impact on the overall design, unless special measures were taken to evaluate the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by placing there a permanent listwork.
During this time, a lot of words of the Holy Spirit, the letter, said in the conversation.
She has worked a lot in the music industry in Germany and beyond.
The team was to contact her first before it was decided whether the subject would be competed for the work.
Often it had been said that the work had to reflect the life at the gate, in the end the head had been vital to Reykjavik since it was made.
When she came to the list, she had to trace the idea of such a work.
It was agreed that she gets drawings and other help before she returns from the country break, where she would work with the proposals abroad.
She got the time she decided to need, and when she returned home, she submitted a few suggestions for discussion.
He was pleased to ask her to work.
Furthermore, it was requested to make a complete agreement with her and the famous listing company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them to establish a famous listing company around Europe.
The agreement was concluded and Gerður took the listwork under the establishment at the workshops of their brothers, which then saw about the establishment of the Customs House.
All the work was well solved by the hands, both by the Half-made Holy Father and the Oidtmann Brothers, says in the agreement.
After that, there was an unforgettable Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to work the work, which was designed and set up in the years 1972 and 1973.
She died two years after the work was completed, only 47 years old.
Increased transfer of more institutions out of the country
Minister of Social Affairs Einar Daedason has announced that more public bodies will be displaced to the country next year.
This was said by a police officer in the district at lunch.
Recently, it was announced that the Brunswick House and Human Activity Association will move to the north of the Southern Crown in the autumn.
Six specialists in the field of brunamala work with the institution but no one of them is likely to follow the institution in the north and the Union of Emergency and Medical Associations has monitored the migrations.
“I think we have to take a step further in this protection.
I am preparing for a further step in this protection.
“More transfers,” he said.
He says convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater spread of public institutions throughout the country.
“I think it is necessary to make more political decisions on the transfer of public work out of the country, as I was doing with the Household and Human Rights Organization,” said Asmundur, but he also took an example of other institutions that have been transferred out of the country and gave a great importance to the community outside of the country, such as the transfer of Food Organization to Selfoss, the Iceland Country to Akraness and employment insurance in the Scandinavian countries.
All the best from the next day of the Championship
The Icelandic championship in freelancing took place at Thorsvelli at Akureyri today.
A number of matches were set at the next match.
It was recorded with an exciting competition in the weakest women in Toursvelli but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH put Iceland in the weakest in 2014 which stood all until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from Ireland ended the match in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Summit back earlier this summer and has been in imagination last week, but she has driven the Icelandic Summit what is summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been fighting with injury and did not reach a strike today.
She had only one valid shot of five, shot 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís thrown the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last experiment and put on the path of a mozzar.
Her island size she set before in July is 62.69 meters and was therefore a little away from it.
Godrun Karita Hallgrímsdóttir from the IR had the next shot of the day but she added her best achievement with a shot up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's group, the FH-ing Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic champion in the badest, won a secure victory but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last cast and set a mozzle.
His island size in the article is 75.26 meters.
Godni Valur Guðnason, Olympic champion and Icelandic champion in the roundup, won a roundup competition on Thorsvelli yesterday but today he competed in the roundup which is his main goal.
Godna Vals is 65,53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and guaranteed the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the next day but he had one significant threw that reached the second seat, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Icelandic airport in long-distance, won the long-distance ship with overwhelms but Hafdís grew the length of 6.25 meters today which is 40 cm from its island center.
In the 200 meters of the women's race it was the IR-ingle Godbjörg Jona Bjarnadóttir who was scratched but she reached the goal in 24,04 seconds while her Icelandic score in the record is 23,45 seconds.
Godbjörg Jona was victorious at Akureyri but she won two gold awards yesterday, in 100 meters race and in 4 x 100 meters race and then also in 4 x 400 meters race today.
In the men's group, Kolbein Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first in the 200 meters race in 21,57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Mána Samúelssyni from Ármanni.
Just like Godbjörg Jona won the Colbein Height gold in 100 meters yesterday as in the 400 meters race.
No punishment for 27 million crown Bitcoin discharge
The tax committee has rejected the claims of a tax investigator who was forced to punish a man for defrauding his funds that had come due to the sale of the Bitcoin electronic currency.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not given a clear evidence of why it would be necessary to punish the man.
In the committee’s decision it follows that the tax researcher said the person had a place of understanding of the material unfair tax accounts due to the 2016 and 2017 income.
He would have exhausted his finances that would have arisen due to the sale of the Bitcoin currency up to 27 million, either intentionally or by a tremendous harassment.
Punish the man for his subjects.
He rejected it in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold electricity for 27 million dollars.
He would have had a record in the years 2009 and 2010 when such would have been both easy and affordable with a regular home design.
He then pointed out that when he sold the currency, the tax compensation due to such sales was substantially unfair and unpredictable.
It would have been possible for the general citizens to be aware of such measures on the tax account.
He hadn’t intended to pay the tax of the exchange and had made a report on his property on the result of the debt account.
He would have asked both the scientists and the tax chief about how this would be done but without success.
Then he said he took the necessary confidence that he was neither born nor born in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began grabbing for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse situation than others to present complex rules that the tax authority would not have formed a clear view of.
The man therefore thought it was right that his taxes for these two winners would be re-evaluated and applied but otherwise would not be punished.
Then he imagined that he was in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to overcome his duties in unfair ways.
The power of the punishment would be out of the whole group and would put him in debt.
He said, “This man understands what football is.”
Andersen Willumsson has been numerous among the teeth of the people but has also promised excitement because of his advance what is the game with Breedablik in the Pepsi Max division.
The shows will be in the edition tonight when they receive IA in direct broadcast on Stage 2 Sport.
The bowl then takes the game out due to four memories on the game and therefore does not come to the game with a new cutting as in the games of the summer so far.
He had written “bla, bla, bla” on his column for the match against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was responding with the payment, but when it comes to the character, it was better to try in the game.
He didn’t go into the field.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to match this game then I thought he would do it or create it,” Godmund Benediktsson said in a Pepsi Max interview, when it was to be Brynjólfi.
“I have to be here for the people.”
Sometimes it’s hard to find out in what position he is.
He’s looking a bit out for the left side when it’s going to feel the game, but he’s with a very free roll in the team,” Hjörvar Hafliðason said.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson tells Brynjólf a real entertainment and celebrates getting such a colorful man in the section: “There’s no one sharing that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with hair, and to be always ready to meet and respond in the interviews.
There is an incredible number of people interested in him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“I am a entertainment.
I have to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the conversation with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what’s next on his head.
This man is just a gentleman,” said Mania.
The KR player says he wants to leave the team - "I've been in contact with some teams in the B division"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be ahead of the team.
According to the Danish center Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Football.net also the issue.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in his homeland but for this he must first terminate his agreement with KR where the Danish division begins before that Icelandic figure.
The company knows that I miss Danemark and has shown me a great deal of understanding,” Tobias said in an interview with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B division and I’m likely to change before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay my contract with KR.”
Then he says he needs all the likeness to take up a salary in Denmark.
“The researchers in Denmark have probably found more for the economic effects of the wind than in Iceland.”
The Bjartmar motorcycle has recovered a wheel for millions - now responds for itself after the DV summary
In the last few years, Bjartmar Leossson has had interests unlike most others.
He stands up and saves lost and proud wheels, electric wheels and wheels.
Bjartmar has admitted the name of the “cyclist” for a week.
Yesterday, there was so a number of fatalities when a man announced a story of his interactions with Bjartmar.
He then spoke in a Facebook discussion of the West Bank group where it came out that Bjartmar had taken the man to talk in the East Valley and said the country might be proud.
There was no other thing to read from the original writings of the electric shooter than that Bjartmar had recognized him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the forecast of the original news DV updated in accordance with it.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case does not explain what actually happened yesterday in the Eastern Valley.
Bjartmar said they had received information from the victims of electrical explosions that this was actually their own electrical explosions.
Their information received a mean owner from others, but the information proved wrong says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the hall and I looked at the scooter, ending with information that there was an electric scooter that had been missed for a very long time and searched for had been.
I picked up first, but when I saw him staying under running out of place on the box I decided to hesitate to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his case and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I’m very good at such a matter, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken me.”
Bjartmar says the man on the electric shooter had submitted as he was invited to show him the ticket for the bicycle and has called himself to the police.
“Yes, great,” said Bjartmar, “we’re just getting it clear.”
So the owner of the electricity switch demonstrated the ownership of his electricity switch and drove off.
Later, the right owner of the firewall said from his story on Facebook, the same as the report from the previous news.
In this bed year that Bjartmar has put a moment on this of his discipline, he says he can count the time he landed up on the side of people on the fingers of the other hand.
“I’ve had peaceful relationships with the hardest people of Reykjavik,” Bjartmar said, adding that motorcyclists are most often the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, cyclists, displaced people and other people who are somehow on the street.
“The economy is a hard home and somehow it is necessary to finance the next amount, for unfortunately the economy of such solutions is a easy way to reach that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationships with these people are really so good that I’ve come with a lot of so good people with me in the team.
The issues are that people have gone into treatment and taken up and searched for me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he says.
Generally, Bjartmars' communications with railroad people are in the Kurdish nights.
Some know about him and what he is doing and prayed peacefully to show him quotes, star numbers of bicycles and so on.
Motorcycle is a big problem that has little been addressed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are more to say far to indicate people to talk to him out of the proud wheels.
Bjartmar is contrary to the previous press release of the DV and says not to be a false automated police in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he is still not arrived on the ice line with his actions, and whether this is not the primary role of the police, Bjartmar says so be.
“Naturally the law is to do this, but the fact of the case is that the law is clearly not to do this.
I have to take a look up on the police riding away from a huge crowd of proud bicycles.
She is clearly said unclean in these matters.”
“When the law is not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of you, and the experience has shown that I can success in this group of cases, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He is said to have achieved so much success in having up on the proud bicycles, that sometimes he runs on his “scale stairs” on the street that then they only have the right Bjartmari bicycle they had previously achieved in.
The exchange that Bjartmar has called for assistance from the police has made it clear that she clearly does not come.
“This just doesn’t work with the police, and it’s not me to teach and it’s not the owners of the railways to teach,” said Bjartmar and thinks that the victims of the railroad railways need to feel for the corruption of the police in this group of cases.
The success of Bjartmars is not shared.
Some can find stories of people thank Bjartmari for having reached their owners to them again.
He himself says Bjartmar has long been losing the number of railways he has delivered, but the amounts, of course, run by millions, if not millions.
There are heavy electric wheels, electric wheels and electric wheels, but electric wheels can cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works on a day to the school and the other every weekend he works on a relationship.
His wheelchair is, therefore, the unpaid work he feels in his free time.
Lives and long shadows
2019 was a great anniversary in the history of life in Iceland.
The ambassadors had known to have received retirement from the Danish Kingdom all the roads from the 19th century, but in 1919 a lifecycle of ambassadors was established which eventually became the lifecycle of all public workers.
The foundation of the current lifetime rates of general payers was submitted in 1969 by a wide range of labour market agreements, which discussed the long-term employment lifetime rates with a mandatory and complete shipping from the 1970s.
In 1974 the laws were thus established on the basis of these treaties and the life risk continued to decline after that.
The living system of the wages was not the only radical change that the 20th century’s economic growth led to with its nuclear power.
The unemployment insurance had had had similar effects in historic acts in 1955, and the association also had a little combined their demands on illness and health care, serious health rights, shortening working hours, disorders in household conditions and so on.
All of these rights cost a great and strict struggle but succeeded, after to keep up, a much greater and more sustainable nuclear disaster than the number of auras in the salary, which went off in the heat of the prize that marked the period after the war and until 1990 as many remember.
The commitment to the establishment of the General Life Council in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although men eventually came together that the ships would be in the real property of the shipping companies, the shipping policy was to fall into their management obliged to arrange representatives of the shipping accountants and shipping companies to the same.
In the coming years after the establishment of the ships, the need for a majority of workers under the ships has often come to debate in the agreements of payers but it has never succeeded, and therefore we still stand up with the unusual provision that the representatives of the ships are not in the majority of ships under the ships.
In Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on the obligation of life rights and the activity of life rights is stated on the investment policy of the seats.
In the 1st chapter, it is stated that “a lifeconomist must have the interests of the community to leadership.”
It is also stated in Chapter 5: “Lifetime investors must put an ethical advantage in investments.”
The policy of the Lifetime Board of Entrepreneurs includes, among other things, the following provisions, in the future of the former legislative proposals:
The Lifecycle is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest Lifecycle and professional in the West and in Europe.
The regulations discuss how focusing on environmental and social issues as well as a good governance of companies can contribute to improving the investment impact of the pricing policies.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of the national community are combined in a wider cohesion.
LV considers it important that the companies, especially those registered in the stock market, establish a public policy on: to adhere to the good governance of the employee's social responsibility and the environmental model.
The company Gildi, which has the country’s largest portfolio, has established a “politics on responsible investments” and there are provisions of similar taxes.
This is all revealed here as an entrance to the latest word of Iceland, “shadow management”.
As it has become new in the case, there is no hope that it has been defined as a fool, but it seems to me that the following definition is now the “most taken”: The shadow management is when the chairman of a corporation says to the media that he intends to send the representatives of the corporation in the management of the corporation a statement or a statement on how they should take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the suggestions, they will be left out of control at the first time.
If the predecessor doesn’t bring this to the media and doesn’t talk about the story, then it’s not yet the “screen management” ends that communication between people is of course forever in the financial context as elsewhere.
I encourage the reader to think what way he feels “more intelligent.”
There are two men who have tried to match this definition when this is written, to the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are the Hörður Ægisson journalist on the Press and Asgeir Jónsson seedbank director.
The issue between the two came after the President of Bogi Nils Bogason of Icelandair had said of his intention to terminate the company’s agreements with aircraft and aircraft (sign them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the President of the Business Society of Reykjavik, then sent them an invitation to the CEO of the company under the leadership of the Lifetime Council of Businessmen not to support the potential purchase of the company’s shares in the company, and they suggested that they will be dismissed.
A short time later, Bogi Nils rejected his decision, and in the end, Ragnar Thor went the same way with his birth that was, of course, the decision of God.
Nevertheless, they saw the Hurt and Asgeir reason to multiply on the matter in the Friday press of the House of Representatives with great words about the shadow management, the law breach and the rich need for legislative changes.
There was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
As the matter is important, let’s consider the matter itself in the end.
I’m going to put in front of those items in the law on life-risk that lie to this matter.
In these, it is understood that the board of directors must safeguard the interests of the board of directors and have an ethical focus in investments, and these items are detailed in the agreements of both the Gildis and the Lifetime Board of entrepreneurs as I mentioned.
However, LIFE investors DO NOT have to look solely to the amount of time-of-the-art surveillance in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous approach and no need to look for a long time to judge such a thing in the past, as a large scale of banks and seats has run to the unconscious adventurers and environmental issues, with severe consequences.
The head of Icelandair was obviously on the ice when he was given in mind to dry out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the well-being that the company has on the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
He saw it and pulled it back.
The time explains whether it is appropriate for the investment in the company to be considered liable towards the company when it is set up.

One of the infected didn’t get home.
One of the three who were detected with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the East South America on 15 July last week, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic who, however, is not resident here normally and therefore has not received clear instructions on receiving such a return after arriving in the country and going to another showcase a few days after arriving.
He was neglected from the border.
“But he’s in the Icelandic community and he’s really going to go to that area,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in healthcare at the National Medical Center and local healthcare while he’s in summer vacation, in an interview with the press conference today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the teacher’s number and if the teacher’s number is not registered then you are not automatically offered in the later show.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad rather than because of his connectivity to the country that the Icelandic would have preferred to use it Icelandic.
He did not realize this.
“When the classroom is not registered, you have to check yourself to come to the next show.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this is the right way,” says Kamilla.
“Therefore, it is clear that we need to provide information about this while we find a way to make an automatic invitation system even though Icelanders don’t record their teaching numbers.
Or then to make it somehow clearer who are the participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
It is better to understand the relevant, however, with the arrival to the country although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, protecting the Icelandic.
Only six have been sent to the custody after he was identified yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They are still going to show but two of them are still going to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
He received a refusal from his visit to the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he has been recently infected by the virus that she has not yet been able to detect it when the sight was taken to the border.
She does not want to avoid that the man has been infected here in Iceland but does not bring the vein with her to the country.
“It’s not possible to assume that this is an invasive infection because it’s long since he arrived in the country that he might have been exposed here like those two who have made a bit of control in connection with the sporting match.”
She says that it’s very dangerous because how little man is surrounded here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but stresses that it can’t be eliminated until the Icelandic heredity has completed the virus in man.
“If we get a species that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he has brought it to the country.”
Piparstreyi and explosions used against protesters
A struggle occurred between police and protesters in Seattle tonight.
Police used the protesters piper speech and unusual fingerprints, but the protesters broke their robes and scratched into.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were killed.
Police and racist demonstrations were demonstrated in the U.S. yesterday night, but demonstrations in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In the East of Texas, one of the protesters was shot down.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
Thousands of people gathered in peaceful protests in Seattle.
A lot of people went to the building area and broke the beds in the city's court house.
In the aftermath, the police said the demonstration was unfair and the struggle came between the groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by the police in August last year, was mentioned by the protesters.
A car crashed through a group of protesters in the city but no one was wounded.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Police gathered together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried a gun and went to the districts to closed gathering where the police commissioned a group of people who protested the protests and also carried a gun.
At the time, 75 people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where the protesters reminded James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white gang in May.
Not the game that defines our time
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United football manager, does not want to do too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English election.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn’t lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men end in 5th place and lose the Championship.
Then they should still hope to come to the Championship by winning the European Championship next month.
“We haven’t come to the meeting.
If we get to a point against Leicester, I think people will say we don’t have a bad time now,” Solskjær said.
“But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot in the country by getting the two teams ahead of us,” Solskjær said.
It’s easy to worry that men will be standing at 15 a.m. today, but the Sunshine tried to leave it as if any other game would be discussed.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you’ll have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company builds on.
We’ve had a great opportunity to finish the season well and now it’s our job to take advantage of it,” Solskjær said.
“This is not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important one.
The outcome does not define our period, we have already had many times to define this period.”
“Bruno Fernandes’ time has changed a lot for us and I think we are going to be in a better form and will be stronger spiritually than in the last season,” Solskjær said.
65,000 Infections in the Sun
65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178.021 infections have been confirmed from the west since the beginning of the traffic there in the country.
900 people were killed by the virus yesterday but the last four days before it was more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus on the sun.
A total of 146,460 deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths by the U.S. military will rise to 175,000 on August 15th.
Fear of the other fighters
The Spanish authorities are now trying to restore the expansion of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health agency over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There are no more reports of a single sunrise since the beginning of May and the rain comes at the same time as the Spanish begins to explore one of the strictest expulsions in Europe.
The background led to the fact that the British authorities now obliged passengers coming from Spain to go to a military check with their arrival.
A week ago, Spain was on the list of Britain over a safe state.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where the government has broken down the limits to try to match the level with the race.
In the capital city of Barcelona, the entertainment workshops will be closed in the next two weeks and the old houses will be closed in the middle of the night.
It is now valid for 200 thousand inhabitants in the Segria region in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of Britain will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy which is greatly angry on the arrival of foreign tourists and is the bad game after the departure.
Tui, Britain’s largest transportation company, announced all flights scheduled to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The authorities around the world are told to be preparing under the next bullying of the traveler but a little interest seems to be in the return to a large-scale expatriate that has already put the economy in the roof.
For example, Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken very bad in such a thing and looks like nuclear weapons he doesn't want to use.
France’s Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “will not come out of life, economically or socially,” if it reacted to the country’s foreign expatriates.
Many counselors hope that the local outlet that reaches the inhabitants of a single town, pay or swimming will be required to keep the road back in the next route if it comes to it.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inland
Three internal meetings were discussed yesterday, and two more on the border.
Thus, five individuals with a positive Covid-19 infection were detected yesterday in Iceland.
In a statement, the police said one infection was linked to the infection that was from yesterday at the ReyCUP football match.
He has been sent to the solitary and the sixteenth who were in connection with him in an army.
The infected was a participant in a social sports conference in Reykjavik and is, according to the report, “only a part of the sports team” in the soccer.
Others who were sent were in a cellar linked to the person in a different way.
The outbreak of this infection is uncovered and the infection is in full course at the state law enforcement agency.
The ReyCUP staff have followed the guidelines and rules of emergency and general health care that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
Although the pictures of the meeting yesterday raised the attention where you could see in a very narrow agreement to celebrate the good celebration of their team out of the valley.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the officials posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
ATH: Parents are welcome to observe the rules that the competitors take their own daughter to the school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.”
The other infection was detected yesterday but is related to the infection that was detected yesterday.
The statement says: “The Icelandic heredity has raised the infection and has revealed a new species of vein that has not been discovered here before.”
The problem is that the infection is also important and the person is infected in a single and 12 in a vaccine due to the infection.
The third story is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He visited the southwestern part of the country.
He is now in loneliness and six who were in the same relationship with him in a solitaire.
Two of them are already going to show the symptoms of veirusmits.
In addition, two have been investigated at the border and are expected for the results of further investigations such as the work process in the border interference.
Finally, the report says: The state law enforcement agency and officials of the countryside urge people to be careful and careful about individual infections.
The main question of whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present is the same request to go to the show at the next health center.
The Patron says the teller is boiled about the shop chain - The guest's hands are different
The deadline is scheduled for the weekend, according to the West Bank announcement.
Guests are willing to look at other possibilities.
It calls West Building Autobahn, Talknafjörd, Melanes on the Red Land, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the station.
It’s enough to be at Patreksheng this weekend, because like last year, Skjaldborg, the feast of Icelandic permission will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and therefore has been a strong tradition in the city.
From the demand in the field to judge can expect a good meeting this year, if the weather does not put strictly in account, but DV said earlier today from the department of prophecy.
However, we can expect the worst weather on Sunday, and hope for the Patreksfords.
The BBC first said it, and said that all the other houses in the town were already completed.
A whole crowdroom cave down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18–20.
Meanwhile, the owners are claimed to build permits for reboot but their revenue has improved in the system in a third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavik, there is a remote multi-city house on three heights.
At the floor of the house there is about 600 meters of shopping space.
Behind the house there are two-step doors which each surrounds four pretty flat apartments.
They are at the car 93-130 meters, but most of them over 100.
The house has a story to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, the hosts of the video studio, the School, the Milkhouse of the Milk Hall, the Joa City Hall, the fish oil and now the last University report.
The house has, so the emphasis is to the word taken, remembered its philosophy more beautiful.
The house is now under great damage, as you can see on the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, according to the company, among other Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus passed for the Borough’s ownership and was a defender of the Borough’s ownership.
In the group owned by the property holding community of the Municipality is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment society of Godrúnar Santu Lárusdottur and her children.
Godrún is equally owner of a third-party in the D18 ehf.
Godrun and her husband, August Godmundur Sigurðsson, once performed the Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has so little that nothing has beenined since then.
Say the neighbors that the state of the house has been worsening constantly since, though most in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the resident, one resident said the house had “not been vibrant in the past year.”
There can be played in that the owners have about a few years of loss after changing the house and the floor.
Other neighbors say the house has not been fine for a long time.
“It’s a long time to do something common with this plate and it’s boring that it’s like this.”
He also says that he’s flown out into the house’s owners because he hasn’t driven to finish this, find some common flows with the neighbors of the house and stop this “technical loss.”
“Do this just in dialogue with the community around so that you can do this and finish it.”
The “technical step” that the resident indicates is the planning process of the journey that has been ongoing since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were granted permission to build a height above the existing multi-house and behind the house, a new lounge and a reconstruction on a single height as well as a height.
The construction license granted for that implementation was granted to the Environmental and Resource Assessment Committee and withdrawn from its validity as the implementation was not subject to a dividend budget and the branch assessment was not sufficient.
The city of Reykjavik then dropped with a deiliskipulation business and dropped it with an announcement in the Government of July last year.
The plan was also approved and it was dismissed in March 2020.
At this time, three years have passed since the initial application for the construction facility and the owner of the house at the starting line.
At that time, the house had crashed down and the neighbors got tired.
When he asked the neighbors of the house out of the situation and the reaction of the neighbors were answered in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the plans of owning the house, others not at all.
Some are angry at the city, others are not.
Others were just angry but nothing out of no one.
Other people said the parking lot was worried, but the neighbors have a new unemployed Dunhaga parking lot 18–20 under their vehicle.
A man in the case said long in the administration:
“Let’s go through the triangle process is quite incredible.
It’s as if Rihanna can’t read.”
Today, the house is closed, abandoned and overwhelmed.
Remember the phase of the city’s management and the oldest plans of the owner and the many years of their work that is now on the starting line.
When the journalist came to the garden at Dunhaga 18, the door and the rubber flooded with him.
Playstation TVs and new TVs run inside about another rope on Earth — the victim of the Icelandic summer show.
The opening was in the old office of the University Prents and there a number of cats from the accident to judge.
It is clear that somebody has calmed around himself in one corner but no one is visible.
Places of rooms and beds and a few plates of geographical plates, which would surely become a book, flourished.
The stores of the apartment house were equally open and living in both.
The journalist was so lucky to meet the inhabitants of the other.
The Russians were going to see a potato for dinner and invited the journalist to enter.
The Romans work for the employee law Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there about some warmth and energy allows you that the company has nothing to do for the house except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not safe to recall the lease.
From the posters in the opposite house to judge it is clear that there has been some number of foreign workers in the last misses.
The number of employees has not been determined by the Covid-19 situation, the end of negotiations in the tourist direction to negotiations in the construction sector and these two industries have been how efficient to take advantage of the employees’ services.
Nevertheless, the hosts of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and encourage the workers and councillors in the community to tremble after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be wellined.
When the journalist quoted the boys in Romanian, the cold was suddenly revealed to him: at the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 meters of land was destroyed.
The owners want to change the house to a bathroom and the neighbors want to improve the condition instead of sharing the definition of the “bathroom”.
Between the planning area of the city is at the starting point, the sacrifice of the end-of-the-country and the possibility of love in the planning process and the scope, the Environmental and Resource Assessment Committee is resolved.
In the house there are so many Romanian workers, just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders threaten to rescue.
The story originally appeared in the weekly newspaper on July 17.
In the fight against overweight in the coronavirus
Britain's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in the fight against overweight, which will among other things be banned by emergency notifications, because he's seriously sick, in part due to his weight.
It remains that Johnson will present the warfare, which has received the title Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the warfare doctors will be encouraged to guide cycling roads for their pilgrims in overweight and will also be engaged in the process of multiplying cycling roads.
Then promises on television will be prohibited before 21 a.m. in the evening, according to the authorization of the British media.
“COVID-19 has warned us of the long-term and long-term dangers of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is convinced that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods,” the government spokesman said.
Johnson himself is faced with a weight loss problem, but he was placed in a gas when he was infected by the coronavirus in our body, and it is partially his weight because he is believed to have been sick so seriously.
Women better to fall to lead the changes
She said the new Constitution would be the greatest step that the nation can take towards greater governance, information and in the fight against corruption and the interests of the general government.
“We need to change a bit now and who is better to lead such changes than that group of society that is easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their female status.
To stand together and be together to lead changes.
So we’re just going to lead these changes.”
She said she was a bit disgusting about the emphasis on Iceland as the “best in the world” in both gender rights and human rights.
“We are not ready to see what to do.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything they need to do.
It is helling.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to a striking group.
We don’t have the same rules all here,” Helga said.
The query said that women are at many leads in good affairs in Iceland but added that, like everywhere else, Icelanders build with a very male value.
She said that the politics moved to shape its own interests, domination and power that were the powers that held misconduct in all communities.
“Women are now committed to forming this group and join together and are just getting a little disappointed that the Parliament is going to look forward to this 2012 National Assembly resolution,” she said.
“It’s the female value that we’re thinking this out of.
Out of human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all really sit on the same table,” she said, adding that the ex-government values were founded in the new government framework.
“We are a very rich country of natural disasters and it’s unfortunate that there are people living in poverty.
It’s terrible, we can change differently,” Helga said.
“It’s unfortunate that there’s a natural rule that women are always less paid.
It’s unfortunate that aircraft operators and nurses need to end up standing in a nuclear array only to get human loans.”

Trying to steal walking passengers in the centre
A man was arrested in the centre of the city on a night after he denied the walking road and tried to get money from him.
Police also stopped the production of pharmaceuticals in Arabia, where two were arrested for the case.
The police then stopped the driver of the motorcycle in the Hilds where the driver was at a speed of 146 km with a height speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been similar to self-righteous.
Police in the capital district had enough to turn in the night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police's daily from five yesterday to five tomorrow.
There was a lot of decision-making due to co-operation.
On Saturday, reports of eleven arbitration agreements were revealed and it was a lot in the journal of the police.
During the night, there were 22 resolutions on board the police.
Six people were arrested in prison this night.
In Arabia, the police were called to the night when the parties shot the airplane.
They were struggling when the police arrived in the garden.
Then nine drivers were stopped for electricity and or phishing.
Four were arrested in the middle of the city during the night, but one of them was kept in prison.

One was moved to an accident after he was killed by crashing on a trampoline in Copenhagen.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who dropped a bicycle head on Kyalarnesi yesterday.
The motorcycle station, according to the police’s journal, was in “very bad condition” and it was a crime.
Can be found in the Monet house on the shop chain
The house, which the printer Claude Monet built in the past four decades of his experience, is now rented on the Airbnb website.
The next free nights in the house are about the shop chain.
The house is small and luxurious, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
He lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two seating rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Compared to the website of Airbnb, it’s the next free week, on the Sunday of the shop chain, and therefore it might be suitable for some shopmen in vacation to try to book the house of the mall.
The two nights over the trade chain do not cost except 964 U.S. dollars or just runs 130 thousand Icelandic crowns after what the next President receives.
Toughened Laminated Safety Glass and some of them go to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been infected with coronavirus within the country in the last three days and most of the infected are uninfected.
Toughened Laminated Safety Glass is caused by this and some of them go to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were killed on the coronavirus in the country yesterday and two on the border.
A specialist at the Department of Agriculture says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
“There’s been a line from the last internal meeting and there’s a virus that has not been seen here before so we don’t have any special reason to think that it has gone down in society for some time.
This is probably something that is new to the country but of course we need to be very good at preservation now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the emergency field of an ambitious countryside.
Most of the infected have been linked to individuals coming from abroad.
Fewer screens are coming out next than a few, which were in contact with those infected are going to show the symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influence in the process and less about other authentic phenomena so we can be quite free by doing this test on individuals who at the time of influence would have found a reason to do something different first,” Kamilla said.
The internship is mostly completed but it is not excluded that more people need to go to the internship.
Two of them were infected after having had a sporting event.
It has raised questions whether it is sensitive to hold such an event.
The Communications Director of the Public Security says it is easy as long as people follow the terms and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost uncertain that the other infected have been infected by the athletes.
“If there is no more solitude from these individuals after they have gone through at these sports matches, then we can assume that our matches at the matches have worked.
But it’s not clear,” Kamilla said.
The law enforcement department is in constant review.
“We need to be ready to enter with further advice or limitations if it seems necessary,” Kamilla said.
After a week of sleep, the milestones will be removed to a thousand people.
This new location could have an impact on the conditions.
“The Evil Thought to Cook” – See the Meal of Elisa Ajar
Elísa Airsdóttir is a fan of the basketball and plays with Val.
She is also a master in nutrition, mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for the meat of the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
The normal day with me begins with meeting at work from eight,” says Elísa.
“Sometimes I go to the room to prepare the dinner before I take my girlfriend at the gym at 3 p.m.”
Elisa feels very nutritious to bring her daughter early to the school.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to the next party exercise.
After exercise it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we feel good to look at one part to tighten the mind.”
Elisa does not follow any certain diet.
She’s putting out a master’s degree in nutrition and thus knows what makes her eat to have enough energy to work, school, family and exercises.
“What I think is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of protein, carbon and fat.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not group food into bad or good, rather nutritional or nutritional.
“It’s okay to eat everything, but not everything at once and not always.”
Elisa is very interested in firearms.
“I feel a certain thought in standing in the kitchen to cook and so much in it.
I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I definitely believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: Happens, chia-fresh, champagne, salt, a little citron salt, let go in milk overnight.
Drop this meal with whatever it is.
Most often it is bananas and a bit of Muslims & Coffee.
I am a great coffee maker.
Millimals: Incredibly missing, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, pure cakes with bananas and mushrooms, bread with flavour and so I could eat hummus with a layer up from the box if so happens.
Dinner: I often offer myself to all kinds of food salts from what is in the refrigerator, chino or building, palm balls, clay salts, baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit what I’m working with.
If the plan goes completely out of the fields (which occurs often), then the egg wheat in the work has come to me so often to save and then there are 2 snacks with milk, ointment and sweet eggs, don’t put more on you.
Millimals: Give me something carbonated for exercises, bread with flavour, morning grain or fruit.
Night: Fish will be very often for the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious vegetables news.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
The citizens' authority in Seattle, Washington, has revealed a rebellion in a crowd of protests in the city centre.
The police attacked a blush and a pipeline yesterday in order to prevent a large area that the protesters put under themselves and stumbled over many houses near the parliamentary house in the city.
Police announced on Twitter that eleven protesters had been arrested and that the investigation site over the damages that were done at the police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of explosion.
City and police officials say the protesters have scratched the police with shoots, flies, bullets and other solutions, and one police officer was transferred to a hospital where his injury was done.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The Blessing was for them to show the protesters in Portland in Oregon the unity, but where in the city has been drawn has come to a harsh struggle between the protesters and the armed forces of the international law.
There, like in more cities in the United States, people gather together under the marks of Black Lives Matter, reminds Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests against systemic racism in the U.S. community and calls for dismissal.
Not withdrawn until after approval
It is still unclear whether the claims of the Iceland Airlines, which are to take effect for the next month, will be withdrawn.
The Electronic Response Agreement on the Icelandic Aviation Society's agreement for the hands of Iceland Airlines will be announced in the afternoon tomorrow.
The company’s chairman, Godlaug Linney Jóhannsdóttir, said he is confident that the Icelanders will not make a decision on the queries until the outcome of the vote is reached.
“It’s clearly connected,” says Godlaug Linney.
“There have been no reports withdrawn, it will be going to be done so that the machines can be managed.
So people are obviously unspoken after getting to know if it will be working after the month meeting.”
The deal was signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is estimated that it is valid for the end of September 2025 and is based on the agreement that the aircraft had previously entered into the approval agreement.
On July 17th, the Government and Security Council of the Icelandic Aviation Society agreed to offer an all-working facility to Iceland, the members accepted it in an agreement.
It never came to her, but this was determined in Iceland's decisive decision to end disputes with the Airline, give up all its flights and seek for agreements with another private company.
Then the fighters of the company had to take the job of security on board timely.
Asking how she thinks the response will go says Godlaug Linney hard to tell about it.
“People are in trouble after this Icelandic approach, when all the airlines of the company were announced and announced that they would meet with another state community.
Now it’s clear if it has an impact,” she says.
940 aircraft operated at Iceland at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, said.
The deadline for their resignation is erroneous, for those who have a short job, it is three months and it is about the monthly meeting of July-August.
About 90% of the aircraft are Icelanders.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
“We are hoping for a continued meeting with our participants.
With this agreement we meet the requirements of Iceland.
If he was rejected, it is clear that the flights have been gone too far.”
The resolution on the nuclear agreement is over and Icelanders will announce a decision for another quarter of the year tomorrow
The airline’s agreement on the new agreement is scheduled at 12 a.m. tomorrow.
Icelandair’s second quarter report will also be announced tomorrow, but immediate outcomes indicate that the company’s revenue has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The Electronic Response Agreement on the Association of Icelandic Aviation and the Collaboration of the Occupational Life for Icelanders begins on Wednesday, July 22, and will be announced tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 a.m.
Those who can vote for the agreement are Icelanders who pay social funds to the Aviation Society.
Icelandair and the FIU signed a new agreement on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday, Icelandair had held a meeting with the company after the aircraft carried out the previous agreement in a resolution at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and airlines of the company on Friday but they were returned after the new nuclear agreement was signed.
According to the new core agreement, aircraft must fly five times more a month for the same base.
The agreement goes into force by 2025, but it has been jointly defined how long passengers and passengers can fly on a single guard.
The agreement was announced to the members of the FFI at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described the number of flights that the news agency talked to them about the disadvantage due to the agreement.
However, the majority seemed to agree that it would accept the agreement to keep the peace alive.
Icelandair’s second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the EBIT, its financial and tax revenue, is denied by 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars, or about 15 billion Icelandic crowns.
Icelandair sent an emergency report to the Coffee Hall last Wednesday but said the company’s revenue amounted to about 60 million dollars per quarter or about 8.3 billion crowns.
Handmade funds and their equivalent amounted to about 154 million U.S. dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion kronor.
Icelanders are also committed to offering a share of the company in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude contracts with fifty lenders, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer for the end of a month before the business car offerings will be made.
A new variety rather than a new species of vein
“The new wire only means that it was a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been painting here within the country,” says Mar Kristjánsson, a doctor at the National Hospital’s Infectious Disease Department, about those who say that “new kind of vein” has been found here in the country.
Three internal meetings took place yesterday and two on the border.
One who was detected had participated in a social sports team at the football match Rey Cup but the source of the infection uncovered and the infection stands over.
The infection was also detected in a person who arrived in the country on July 15 and two who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then the infection was detected yesterday that linked to the infection that was detected from last week and after a radar examination by the Icelandic Heritage Association was revealed “a new species of vein that has not been detected here before.”
The infection is concluded in connection with the infection.
It is not a new virus, it is the same virus and has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new species of that vein than about a new species of vein.
Asked what it meant and if it could say something about the other bullshit has begun, Mar says that as if it is a short case to be discussed and it could go so that there is nothing more out of it.
“But if there is a case in the country that is not connected from abroad and is with the same inheritance and this particular variety, then it would be possible to withdraw that extinction [in the latter period] but it is untemporary to be so supported,” explains Mar.
Congratulations in the hot pot
Is the secret of the happiness of the Icelandic lies in the hot pot?
The BBC’s journalist leads to the appearance of a fun video that brings light on the country’s swimming pool and air conditioning.
The Icelandic swimming pool is special in the world and it is believed that none in the world has the same number of swimming places for each inhabitant.
The natural earth heating is the basis of it, but also the tradition of sunrise that runs here.
Recognition of children was lawful in 1940 but older citizens are not yet able to use their hot water for health care.
Conditions are described as the fifth part of the general well-being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of the shortage and position.
On mobile phones, people talk together on personal nights around home and space or benefit from the similar power of the water: thinking and speaking the electricity of the seals and the body.
A hundred days to vote.
There are hundreds of days until the U.S. votes and chooses a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a resignation but he is still on the side to request.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s expected candidate, has a lot of predictions to Trump on the country, is the center taken by the reviews.
According to a recent survey by the AP news agency, a number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s reaction to the world’s new coronavirus is, in the same way, very unacceptable, and there are more Americans than before the president’s economic agreements were bad.
Only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the crisis and 48 percent say he’s kept well on the economic agreements.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent on the country, while Trump is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to attract the attention from his leadership towards the threat to Biden, to beat under such a cultural conflict and to provide a date that is to turn to laws and rules.
The Biden proposal, however, makes a lot of trouble to keep the attention of Trump and considers a lot of possibilities of taking victory out of the vote if the election is actually about how Trump has been working in the past four years.
The unacceptable Trump also seems to be going to fall down on the Republican Parliament and fears the Prime Minister that Democrats could even reach a majority of the U.S. population, which has so far been very rapid.
Politico said that in the days that the follow-up of the group and the candidate remained interdependent and that is now the Republican Party would hold its greatest decline in a decade.
The outcome has been bad for the group in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now there is a prediction that this development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the inhabitants to follow, among other things by saying that becoming President Biden, he will ruin the U.S. interests and beat under racist influence.
Among other things, Trump has abolished the regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase diversity in media.
He then called on the U.S. officials to read an article about the former New York Assistant Director, where she believed Biden would waste U.S. officials and took Trump under it.
“The world will ruin your missions and the American dream.
I’m going to keep it, and even do it even better,” the president said.
The United States of America is a growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the membership of this group has become the president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney received the majority of the votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Scorecards have shown that despite Trump’s secure majority in the 2016 campaigns, his follow-up has significantly collapsed.
Although there is a difference between the facts, Biden has suggested about a fifth-percent advance to Trump in the outcomes to the past.

Will the Olympics shine at the end?
After the final decision had been made to stop the Olympics, an event that only the World Wars have brought forward to this, the president of the Olympic Committee said that the Olympics would be “the light at the end of the gates,” and indicated there probably the world’s coronavirus that the world building is now experiencing in a combination.
Businesses have an additional year to prepare and the authorities in Japan increase their costs due to the delay.
Everyone holds a lot of water.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the site of the Olympics this year, the celebrations of Japanese representatives were disappointed.
They were crying and laughing to the end, Tokyo had a vote to keep the games 2016 but it was once in a lower position for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan had to pay attention to the world.
The games are scheduled to be scheduled for 24 July to 9 August but have been scheduled for a year and will start on 23 July 2021 and will be scheduled for 8 August.
If you can’t keep the games then, if the coronavirus will still be too big, the games will be stopped.
No one wants to think about that to the end.
The Olympics are not a regular sports match.
Nothing is to save, the show must always be wonderful and seeking to top the last game.
The election of the city for the Olympics is based on the measurement of the elected on the nominations of the winners.
The bigger the presentation is — the greater the likelihood of hanging the mouth.
Tokyo was worth 150 million dollars in trying to get to hold the 2016 Olympics or as a student of a wealth of 20 billion dollars.
The last time, when it was about the 2020 Games, 75 million pieces, about ten billion crowns, were placed in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo was awarded the games this year, the Japanese authorities had so when paid as a student 30 billion crowns to the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the sea depending on how much it costs to build an Olympic club, play and generally to strengthen the country’s incentives to address such a move, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Planners in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which had to be ongoing these days but have been restored for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
In a report from the Japanese government official, which came out at the end of last year, it was that the cost would be twice the price.
Probably it will not be possible to add full food to the cost of playing the games but it has been planned to cost the car two to six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could thus run on the car 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so high figures that all the tax rates of the Icelandic state are worth only about the close half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are events of such a scale that they have become a comprehensive subject of economists, who try to show in numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, it seems so many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are negative but so positive for their economy paying to keep them.
The cost-time benefits are some, for example, a number of jobs very much for the cost of time, but for a longer period of time the cities are sitting up with debt discharge and unnecessary recharge costs a little usual human activity.
The river in Brazil lies with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been in trouble by costing maintenance on all the major sports activities that were built for the games.
It has been estimated in numbers after the 2012 London Games, but it has shown that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that it was not about talking about a new job except for a small amount of time.
In general, cities have not been well out of the financial holding of the Olympics due to the sliding costs that accompany the human works that are built for the games.
The benefit, however, is considered to be recorded in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympics in the choice of games, which, however, is greatly uncertain about the games of 2021.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to take all that number of listeners that usually download the games.
The main thing is the honour that the cities desire to be in power, but it is difficult to calculate for money.
Therefore, despite the fair cost, it can also be said that the pleasure that the games bring is not the nature that it can be placed on a prize.
But although the show is very important and nothing is to be saved, it is of course not just about money.
There are the sports that are in front.
For some people, it’s surprisingly just loving to play the games.
For example, the Australian five-year-old and golden prize winner in his post on the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is a calendar and would have been far from a good season in the summer but hopes to be in a competitive form for the Games 2021.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just more pleased with the temptation, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to stop after the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the temptation of the players in some cases means that they stop the competition before the games take place.
Trust your body simply not to go through years in addition to heavy exercises.
Few athletes were equally exciting in the hearts of the 2016 Olympics and the film star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold on her neck and one bronze.
Biles has met in several talks in his home to the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is scheduled for the 2021 games, but she is not sure she will still be at the top of the games next year, after it will be 24 years old.
Although it’s generally not counted high age, it’s a good idea for the phimplay in the first row.
“This is a controversial issue,” says Biles, but laughs in another interview posted on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page asking if it plans to reach the 2021 Games as long as it did in Rio 2016.
“I clearly don’t know if I’m still at the top after a whole year in addition to exercises,” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body doesn’t tolerate the algae that follows physical training much longer.
However, she will be playing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles acknowledges that there was an unpleasant feeling of having to stop exercising suddenly when the world rise stood up and the phimle room was closed.
There were no obstacles for Biles more than others while all the athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympics could not buy any access beyond others, she had to find a variety of ways to keep herself in shape like others.
The foundation is better than with most people.
“We have a steady plan now.
It was difficult to start exercising first again after the phishing room opened.
We started quickly, but we’ve come to a full-fledged new and I’m going to expand with the exercises smoothly and tightly according to what’s going on in the year.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held but we still try to consider that they will be, we can’t do anything else.
I’ve already spent too much on myself to leave the sport now,” says Biles.
With it, it seems that more people are blind or more aware that this place can come up that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Predicting it is desperate.
No one can know how the World Cup will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do is to prepare for the Olympics as they will be held a year.
Maybe the Olympics will be light at the end of Covid.
The wedding ceremony due to the accident
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to retire her wedding because of the coronavirus.
She had to marry the former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about the actress now,” the actress said in an interview with People.
“We definitely want to get married some time and have that dream wedding and have all the accessories that are loved by us.
But we decided to put it on a temptation and focus on what’s important accurately now and it’s to help you share information about the importance of being with grims and keeping yourself at home.
I look more at the worlds than the weddings these days.
A lot is going on and we have to direct our attention to what is happening in the world.”
