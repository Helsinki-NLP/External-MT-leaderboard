The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the fast fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of ČEZ’s shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of the trade Tuesday, immediately reacted to Monday’s fall when it dropped approximately 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall of the stock on Wall Street.
It also expresses the market reaction to the result of the voting of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
The fall of stocks in Asia
The Asian Stock Exchange shares experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although over the course of the day the index eventually mitigated part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day marked almost a four percent, although later it mitigated its losses by reducing the decline to practically a 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the movements of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sidney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent but at the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Secretary of the Index, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The programmed rescue actions in the U.S. are insecure and this affects the financial markets around the world,” said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e. without dependency from the Central Bank of China.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
The Bloody Bath of American Actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (approximately $12 billion) should be devoted.
The lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. shares lived a bloodshed and mainly the shares index recorded the highest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. a similar volume decline was last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal didn't go ahead, the index began to drop freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion in bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a deal in broad terms of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be held early next week.
U.S. lawmakers caused a gap in talks about the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must make some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it is voted.
The financial system aid plan will be discussed on Monday at the Representative Assembly.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and the Assembly Bank, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
After that, however, it will be reached to the “desencantation” thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market assistance will also be achieved in practice.
The plan must be effective.
“We have made a great progress.
We resolve our discrepancies about how the package of measures should have to stabilize the market,” Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
The final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial companies the unselected mortgage assets that lead financial companies to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the plan agreement, which will work and should also be effective on the market.
It is necessary to continue with the sanitation plan yet, but I think we’re already in it,” Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis expressly affects the stock market that falls rapidly.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are doing everything they can for Congress to definitively approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to calm the business of investors before the Asian financial market since these are the ones they find in the first hourly gap and where Congress could influence on Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing sure about when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stand in the last moment with some problem.
The lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not meet its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was preserved that it consisted of earning financial resources for the recruitment of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
“We have worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote for the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday’s progress and that he appreciates “the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the Armed Contract
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the program’s money to protect taxpayers from their losses, a relieving closure of the scheduled financial plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called blinded contracts for directors of the participating companies in the program, and create a committee that will have a control of the Fund.
This should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping household owners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new payments of the mortgages it purchases in order to lower the monthly charges of the payments at the deadlines of the debtors and enable them to stay with their houses.
Marek: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be made but quite difficult.
"And that's why it's not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek said this week, to the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not so relevant, according to Marek.
“More more important is that, already this week, Congressmen agree on their support and give them their good view as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval will be reached is, at this time, the most important thing,” Marek insisted.
Armed hand fight: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile players play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the reproducer.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and on the demand of the future owner.
Probably it will be difficult to acquire the most modern tocadiscus to hear in it Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP's discs are no longer out, and in terms of their quality there is no single objective reason to continue buying them.
If the vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blues music are stuck in their shelves, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of this type of tocadiscos.
This is the same with music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
There are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
It also decides the battery duration.
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even what not even the majority of mobile phones.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as telephone, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and can even get to browse.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator knows how to make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
How many more functions you use on the mobile before the screen indicator will be lighted asking for recharge.
And music reproduction is one of the greatest tracks of energy.
Few are the mobile ones that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) have clearly greater performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, they are constantly calling still, for more safety, a carrier for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem won’t have, since even the worst stand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a loading.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some unreduced reader units the small memory cards that are used on mobile can be connected.
In the players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobile and players create their order in the musical library alone according to the name of the interpreter, title of the album, gender or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only display a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Search and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, be interested in the battery resistance, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you’ll listen to it every day just a while, like on the tram, then it’s enough with any mobile that you reproduce.
This is what almost every mobile phone can do.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player play music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and almost all the music you get will be in this format.
It is among the most extended and excluding it the absolute majority of the apparatus play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the company Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile devices also enable, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just through the mobile internet visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could be by itself a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the topics of fugacious success of the radio.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, in general, it is supposed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always wear a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always wear headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile even if it is at least a MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobile phones with music will be their price.
The cheapest is usually less than 3,000.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic headphone entrance.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually managed by anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current casets or also to the touches is obvious.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, giant account by data download.
Which device to decide
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are usually equipped only with a 2GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (as maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are considered among the most demanding music lovers take the hand of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobile phones have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the highest listed brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer practically all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It will probably not take long to arrive.
That the Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the European Commission’s latest steps in the field of roaming rates regulation it is likely to come to a paradox situation – for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
Probably this seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that in the Czech market there is an extreme competition.
From this also the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already expressed that there is no more place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entrance of the virtual operator to the mobile phone market brought a remarkable price decline before which the classic operators had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of shark like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is a place for this type of operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Just after half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the group Penta which, in addition, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is in the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, so that they can work effectively, it is enough for them to have many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large expenses on the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators normally profile with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, are often contrary to the offer of more tailored services.
Thus, for example, Mobile Tesco in Britain offers SMS at least half the cheap with respect to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a good blow also the bet for a nothing trivial target group.
This operator is specifically directed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator you like and who you can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It’s hard to say if a similar concept like that of Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services is relatively saturated.”
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
“We’re talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it doesn’t seem too hopeful.
It’s rather the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studničková, a spokesman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation to mobil.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not tend to this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything they can so that there is no potential competition.
Interest about the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
“We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the earlier, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all the Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have managed to advance in the meetings,” said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
And then, they may have better times.
It seems that, by non-official information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly already at the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this point we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
Until now no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project on this ground,” said Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional compliance with O2’s opinion, adds: “From today we have not recorded any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, may continue to develop.”
“In T-Mobile’s network it will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon.”
Vodafone focuses on compliance with the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of expenditure and infrastructure allocation.
We consider it the greatest contribution from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nuts and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price decline and thus a profit decline.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When the operators want to get something, they are able to throw from the same corner, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Per the greatest pressure to the ČTÚ was at the time of the U:fon entrance by the company T-Mobile.
This is confirmed by the public information accessible on the website of the ČTÚ.
But just now U:fon serves as an argument of why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: “In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would imply great demands for him and, above all, for his services.”
That’s why this access to mobile operators is tremendously disanimating due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competition to intervene in commercial tender, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Offers (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical attitude to this problem.
“The entrance of a virtual operator to the mobile phone market would be possible after a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
Until today no agreement has been closed since the offer of the potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classical operators,” added Kristián Chalupa, from the UOHS Department of Foreign Relations.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is something more than a consideration, besides that they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the abroad where virtual operators work normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the price decrease of mobile phone services"
Evidently, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the price decline do not enter the interests of the UOHS.
Really the dramatically shocking thing in all this case lies in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered by itself.
It’s the same as with the price of the gasoline in the gasoline since it’s clear that it’s work of coincidence and a hard struggle for competition.
“The Office in this sense has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to somehow intervene.
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise of responsibility in their performance on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, lack, as well as telecommunications regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflict points.
Evidently there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the CTU according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to arise it is always necessary the agreement with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS it should represent a warning the fact that three mobile operators rise strikingly similarly.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators clash with many similar obstacles.
Carrying responsibility in the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications of which the UOHS laves the hands in all this matter.
We have met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately recently a new amendment to the telecommunications law was submitted to the expansion of the competition of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial tenderings that was not taken into effect, even when a series of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be perfectly known by UOHS representatives, but it is obvious that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything goes well when no one looks.
At the same time, unnoticably continues to work something like a pseudovirtual operator that in the Czech mobile telephone networks already exists a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only one part are public.
These are usually companies that are dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually, only a few selected people get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same, charging a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of return.
“If such cases were discovered, we could talk about infringement in the contract conditions that could be translated into the end of collaboration with the given society,” said Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this type carried out by mobile telephone operators will not reach responsible people.
Exactly in the case of the three companies mentioned may come to deal with thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get some unpredictable profits and, at the same time – unlike authentic virtual operators – in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: “the law allows a speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a disappointing so much percentage of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that the SIM card of your phone is not at your name so they can’t have it absolutely as a normal customer of the operators.”
This is exactly what it should seem to the CTU at least strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile phone operators turn their eyes into this type of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator’s entry?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has the sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it is that it will not want it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As it was already clear in the text, the entrance of the virtual operator to the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in services prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at this time the regulatory bodies have intervened and in no case defended the operators but their customers.
With formal measures or informal pressure they succeeded in the first virtual operator to emerge and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority all this case happens as if it were a burning key.
By our experience, we can not cease to be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let’s not desperate.
If this information between backgrounds is correct and the virtual operator really reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile market probably begins to move again.
If any of the operators let any mobile virtual operator enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home.
The new hymn was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with male voice and one with female voice, one with Coro and one with instrumental.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national singer as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I’ve tried with the two and then, also, with the Corus to fix in the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance,” he commented.
The Czech official hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home sounded for the first time in the year 1834 on the tables of the Theatre of the States in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first strike of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official hymn.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the “new” hymn sounds
The MHD of Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date when the first passengers enter the metro, the tram and the bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at the moment by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30 days, 90 days and the annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously charge it on their chip card at the transport company’s infocenters and positions at the metro stations, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The bonuses can be purchased on the website of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than 400 people.
Those who begin to use the internet as a form of trade, can definitely begin to forget the ticket stations at the subway stations, where until now they had to regularly make a tail to get out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the internet, and the Opencard card is charged in some of the 13 subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared staff that helps those interested with the online purchase and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card,” said project spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the expenditure automatic machines that are in some metro vestibules.
How are these expenditure machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picking machine and travelers will probably have already fixed on them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“Now there are five in the city but at the end of the year it would have to be eight,” Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver.
The use of the machine, which will begin to work tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonuses from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the circumvalation trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the inhabitants of central Bohemia locations.
“In the trains attributed to Prague’s integrated transport there are revisors equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area,” the bill control officer, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, who establishes Prague’s collective transport schedules, said.
Circumvalation buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's ticket.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel in the circumvalation buses and don’t remember when they’re ending the validity of the bonus can go to the expenditure machines where the cards are charged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
Southeast states want to join the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudets demanded in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, presumably, some groups of Germans from the Sudets were addressed to the U.S. President in 1945.
It comes from the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that are today stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the U.S. President not to allow the return of the "Šumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
“We’ve understood the situation correctly and we really want his word that the American units are arriving to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter, signed with a “people carrying Šumava’s fate in their hearts.”
Since the unity of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably implies – according to these the Czech national character – an hope only in brutality, discontent, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
“We can’t believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, it will deliver us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects the minorities and that in absolute collaborates with the victory of the allies,” the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of repressions of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably doubts about this idea of the Šumavese Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the Šumavese lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under its patronate.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have today of post-war history, can sound a little childish, according to some specialists paint attentively the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to mind at least that it was going to be dealt with about their expulsion from the Republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudets some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, enrolled in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British captured him and placed him in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that when they came home, the Czech would come well,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Benes decrees would be removed from the Republic.
Don’t think – pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional Campaign that decided to launch on Wednesday the Ministry of Transport in the media.
Minister's office, Aleš Řebíček promises that it will dissuade drivers from dangerous driving on the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
It would have to dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol to the wheel.
And also to remind them that before getting started, the ceilings are heated.
It wants to get to awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also of professional drivers.
What can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embrace emotions.
And for this we are attested by the “sanguinary” announcements throughout the campaign:
Don’t think – pay!
The word "Do not think" is written with large letters on the registration.
And in a shark of blood is the word “pay”.
This should symbolize that a man at a time of dismissal can get to pay with his own life.
Advertisements will “fear” the spectators by the year 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
It promises that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The announcement was made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and Sugar for Drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and fat system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a semaphore passes in red and thus saves time.
It is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be remembered the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Kořán.
And that’s why it is necessary a press informative campaign and primarily a negative advertising, the psychologist concrete.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of practically all the occupied lands in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that on Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) lands if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We’re sure we’ll be with some percentage of these lands, but to the Palestinians we’ll have to give them a percentage similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution it would also include Jerusalem this.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn't want the tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as it happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the temple hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the old city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he insisted later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Highlands which from his point of view is an inherent condition to conclude a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also imply some concrete efforts from Damascus.
“I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they’ll have to do to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah, they will have to take away from the permanent support that provokes terrorism from Hamas, Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” he said.
Question after the accident: Are it illegal in buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk in a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova, we raise the question of whether the shelters and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the shelter’s activity is contrary to the road traffic law,” Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old Saphata died last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed on the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least secure place of the vehicle despite having other two seats reserved.
However, the bus may have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the precise time when the shelter distributes the coffee or the newspapers.
Here what the paper plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have places to walk, which was confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
“This has been resolved with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, they withdrew it and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is in motion if they have a seat," he said.
The law does not know the law.
“There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the safata – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal prohibition prohibits transport agencies to perform any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Auditor, whose rights and obligations are not defined,” said Hanzelka.
The head of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks, on the contrary, that the law suffices this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has the permitted homologation to have places on foot.
That’s all,” he says.
The buses are divided between the urban, where there are places to stand and maximum speed limited, interurban with places to stand with a greater speed permission and those of long distances without places to walk, with the greater speed permission and with seats equipped with security belt.
As on the plane, the expert says.
BESIP’s expert in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hořín, does not see important problems as regards the movement of the shelf in the bus.
“Thro the development of the journey there is no much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
Not even here you have the certainty that the turbulences arrive and that the saffat can be hit in the head.”
However, if the bus suddenly brakes obviously that physical laws are valid.
The same as in a city bus or tram.
Safety of the carrier must solve it by the carrier’s internal regulations,” he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
The Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the shelter service.
He employs two hundred.
The director, neither after the accident, considers that work risky.
"But at the time I have the impression that the shelter position is risky, then I will remove it.
The coffee and the newspapers can receive it, the passengers, when entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In interest in safety is the reason why Asiana lacks shells in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have any shakes, we’re against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a deadly accident," he said less than a year ago to Týden.cz.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the crash of the line that connects Naples, a young Pilsen saffat who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovene truck that probably turned from the parking line blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the saffat were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book them for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to demand the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl’s family but awaits the financial expenses also by the guilty.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring a greater accuracy on the movement of the saffat in the bus in which for a year they are working thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport.
However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They don’t dedicate too much to the buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march,” says expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the saffets something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers,” concludes spokesman Hanzelka, that the safety control in the buses is the competence of the police and the Safety Office at work.
Dusseldorf's hope is backed in Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of the West LB bank to its collaborators do not lack great words.
By the merger of the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank it can be formed 'a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as the writing says, published Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profit capacity would enter such business.
Furthermore, such a merger can be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
Thus it comes to understanding the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because, like before, the West LB is under huge pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute of Financial Services Surveillance that recently made clear to the Government of Northern Renania-Westphalia that there is little time to find a solution.
For a long time, also from the part of Frankfurt, a lot is spoken about the unity of this kind between the DEKA bank, which the customers of Sparkasse know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
To say the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August left know that he does not see any sense in the fusion of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as for example the Helaba or the West LB.
But the DEKA board, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business on the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
It’s not the first time that the consolidation in the Sparkassen field appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Francfort financial site.
In 2003 at a time the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinado and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union remained unsuccessful.
Just after the plans were made public, Hesse’s government expressed itself against Helaba’s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Renania-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of the DEKA bank’s merger with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board, expressed that he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Because, when the Bavarian parliamentary elections are going to pass, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
This is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it was much better out of the financial crisis that made it by the real estate in Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
It is only the Nord LB.
But such geostrategic reflection forms only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question about a trade model that could guarantee the future for the regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro- Verband so far did not give any answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
So, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can compare the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
It’s the first time for Elena, and for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena assists him as her girlfriend, and that’s why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built an enormous bear tiger that shows 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palm, then a kiss.
They arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the train station Porta Nuova, this night at 23:45 out three buses, ` address Munich, the beer party', predictable arrival at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are provided primarily for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking next to their flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who carries a long shirt with an artificial skin fork and glasses with silver-colored paths, belongs to these buses.
For five years they come to the Oktoberfest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the prado, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian law of purity, disease insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
On the night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There is no beer yet.
Soon the tranquility reigns in the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
But they will still need the strength.
Go to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration make another break on the 8 highway shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the scheduled arrival at 6:30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
I put you a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign store are opened, that means going!", Marco screams in the morning.
“March!” march and occupy the back sites in the campaign store.
“Don’t take the places in front, because we’re going to block, and you all with yellow hates don’t sit in the same banquet, distributed by all spaces.”
A litre of beer, ruge Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the propin
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He’s just going out of his place, he’s already busy!”
Third: “This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to come here!”
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, stretches the yellow hat on the trees, traffic signals and even on a chart of the elections of a great People's Party of Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data about the number of people; it’s about 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormfully enter the campaign stores, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
Munich police receives assistance from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria that makes a statistics of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (approximately 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite store of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
No-Sleep Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
That well, the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking field will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate finance, which is listed on the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a billion credit to be able to resist the turbulences in the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid increased to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate will use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as public law banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a report, state financeers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects funded them only for a short period—which now, due to the uncertainty in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital delayed slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continuous income from financial investments and net profit from financial transactions fell to zero, tax revenues for debtors and some securities as well as those from the dissolving provisions of credit business tended to fall by more than 70 percent, in 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many reimbursement revenues from ex-Depfa group restructuring compensation expenditure as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and organized business for consortium companies, the negative balance could accuse a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in the year 1990 the former state finance at first lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As a lot of money could not be earned with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to dedicate intensely to the projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortisations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were cancelled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans decreased essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to fund a part of Defa’s credit portfolios of its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group’s financing for a short time and the company is assured of “the influence of the international monetary markets that now essentially are not suitable for functioning.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the Hypo Real Estate board, explained that Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute of Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) come from the basis that Hypo Real Estate Group’s competitiveness from now on is secured.
That is what the shareholders and creditors of the bank have to expect.
But due to the dynamics and taxability of the crisis there is no constance.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
However, the opposite case cannot be excluded.
It was the voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation can not calm at least concerned people.
The stock price dropped to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts almost don’t change, loan courses according to the position in the property registration clearly tend to drop.
Affected are above all the loans of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and with reason the loans whose expirations fall back in 2009.
After the notable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that previously were an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, while you can start from the pension amortization within a deadline.
Or something will happen, which no one risk to imagine – the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the crossed news about partial statistics, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That will be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking the head on the decision on their enthusiasm isolation.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use the transfer to a new account of losses for upcoming tax payments of profit compensation on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent?
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to appear at the Tachibana High School the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
“The first day in a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was afraid.
I live on the border of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train for 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
Solah had to find the way, fortunately I didn’t lose myself.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
At 8 a.m. the students come, at 9 a.m. a small meeting with the teachers begins, the 'home room'.
Before I started the class, I had to present myself.
I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put a old hairstyle from my host family mother and also a bluse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
For, so dressed I put myself to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
I was very happy at this time because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have cushed, laughed and made signs and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my food.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly moved to my place.
The girl next to her had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions—at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
After all, all of them took their bells out.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else than bored pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small salchiches, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases, I don’t even know what is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is sure is that everything is very rich.
Well, with the exception of marinated cherries in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bents are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a blessing made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it in the hope of being able to know him better during a recreation.
I read this in my manga-comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why exactly Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend the school for a year.
He always answered:
“Well, because it fascinates me.”
For years I have preferred to read Manga.
To be able to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
I was absolutely sure that one day I’m going to travel there.
Also because I have a flaque by traditions and customs.
They have a great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I haven’t felt lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
But rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cowboy feeling the danger escapes, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control if they, behaving in the same way as us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the selected answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to try it?
I think the animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without that I or someone else could try it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it gets dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don’t believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contain our subjective experience with that of the animals.
First, almost always they include the circuits associated by the human consciousness of the prefrontal lateral lobe of the brain cortex (because of their participation in short memory and in the executive functions that direct behavior).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects referred to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in man’s linguistic nature: As most of his experience is united with the language, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even when consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the animal consciousness, created anyway, would in many cases differ from most of our state of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents great problems.
Most of my interventions refers to the content of the conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that’s what happens during primates’ short memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential goes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
What is that for the sensations?
I owe to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as for example the reactions of the body).
Given this point of view, the sensations are very fixed on the part of the brain cortex which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others along with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations arise from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the body feelings and the necklace, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but he is more concentrated on the necklace.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be referred absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: but how can it be controlled if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Looking at the danger a cowboy escapes, because why is it afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar cranes, the cracks, on the contrary, don’t have at least one brain.
Is it the trunk of the encephal that is responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to try it for men: How can you try it in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cottage (who knows it?), have sensations.
I don’t know how you can try it.
I prefer to investigate rats' emotional behavior than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case here the progress in the field of neurology is expected as long as the same is measured by rats and men.
As I don’t investigate the language and the consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I don’t see beyond my nose, but I prefer to advance than to work permanently without results.

UEFA President Platini: Grace Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as the proof of confidence of Ukraine’s ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in both countries there is a lot to do.”
The construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is cozy.
The number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis said.
“UEFA will not take the eyes away from us.”
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the sport minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious danger that the PZPN is unable to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many first division clubs were condemned because of downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be delayed.
Dennis Quaid's Indignated Contraattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about private life—and has problems with her ex-marriage: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-marriage as an adulter.
He is angry and counterattacks.
The delayed War of the Two Roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant battle between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage failure is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: "This is unhearding how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told New York Daily News.
Among other things, it’s very “pleasant” that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again “will remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child.”
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is married again and has recently been twin pope.
And thus he ends with his statements putting up: "Let my life continue.
I’m happy because I have a wonderful family that’s well.”
The prices of air tickets and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008 air tickets and night tickets in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and hotel night tickets were again cheap – these are the results of an American Express travel and financial services provider’s study.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of the year 2008 and after the price rise in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half.
After the prices on the hotel market continued to rise for many years, nighttime in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by average to 6.9 per cent.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were more perceived in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the dollar rate weakened, which was the cause that “the interests of American tourists in travel decreased.”
The decline in hotel prices is also noticed much more in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels rose to 26.3 percent and thus boost a record in Europe.
In the first quarter the price of air tickets also showed the rise trends:
Due to the price rise, Economy class travellers had to pay 7.1 percent more per average term than in 2007, long-distance flights even made more expensive to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of the Economy-class flight tickets, compared to the previous quarter, fell by average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and the Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more notable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half dropped to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, prices for national flights in Germany even decreased to half.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the rise of the flood economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the aircraft travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The signal of the stressful situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of the year 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him is not yet out to make the decimoprimer goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed making a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly reacting to what happened, he could read it clearly from his lips.
I only knew I was right.
“We need a second goal,” said Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance at the Hamburg Stadium.
I didn’t pass anything special on the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the present were again on their sites.
Rieger was almost for three decades HSV physiotherapist, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach sinked with his head and lifted his fingers in a sign of assentiment.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's main coach.
His order was the same: Go, the second goal!
But that was not achieved.
“Today not everything was pleasant to see,” Marcell Jansen added later.
Bastian Reinhard had also wanted to have him “more relaxed.”
The 1:0 (1:0) result Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head impact; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“This was a dirty victory,” said Martin Jol.
On Monday, the SV of Hamburg will meet its 121 years.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky on the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” Marcell Jansen said.
I predict that the partial scores of the table correspond more to the league’s greatness than to the dominance of your HSV.
The quip with their forced players late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but yet the quip cannot shine with their successes.
“We need more of feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the vote defeat
The fear is spread on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank's rescue package left Down Jones falling to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for one day in his history.
After that, the Dow Jones was recovering.
About 20:30 one of the world’s largest stock exchange barometers quoted a 5% deficit in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express which lost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs shares lost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had financially participated in the company.
The rescue plan plans to put resources available to buy so-called "powerful" mortgage shares.
But the amount will be paid by step but by step.
As a compensation for that, the state has to receive the shares option receipts for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cash.
Stock rates in Europe and the U.S. continue to decline
Billion aid to banks in Europe and in the U.S. does not calm investors.
The course of the stock of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is down and negatively affects the Dax.
Despite the rescue of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue shares of the federal government and private banks, Munich real estate finance shares a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and quoted a 3.7% deficit in 5,839 units.
The financial markets worldwide have fallen.
The opening of the Wall Street day in New York began with remarkable losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion rescue package is not enough to boost the financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until remaining at 10.809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the rescue project, the vote in the Senate may be on the 1st of October.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at the beginning the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index after profits fell to 1.26 percent at 11.743.61 units.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of the spacecraft
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon causes disconcert to researchers: Dark matter influences the speed of the spacecraft during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft spent almost 18 years flying into the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are cooling now threatens you to die in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational attendance to the maneuver, causes disconcert among the researchers.
Gravitational Assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of the space sonds during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of a planet’s gravitational field, for example Earth.
This allows the spacecraft to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Sun Ulysses probe did it.
But what surprised the researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100% as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
There are often irregularities in speed.
Improvisely, the sond has greater or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect so far.
It was called an anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of matter’s attraction by the space curvature may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be the dark matter that may also be very close to the Earth,” he writes.
The universe’s researchers have known the existence of dark matter for only ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The dark matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible, which means it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Turists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on rescue have already begun.
The Germans fall again at the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our citizens and other prisoners are released.
“Now we’re checking your health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian accompanents are well and are in safety, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants in the desert expedition are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the prisoners: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army suddenly had killed six kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue,” the guard said.
It was just about “receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them were arrested in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded Germany the rescue in the amount of six million euros; the money had to deliver to the German wife of one of the detainees.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female prisoners after they have received the rescue.
The men had to stay detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position regarding this report.
“Padrastro abuse has led to suicide”
According to the court, years of abuse by her patron led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight charges of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Trudeau, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly bound his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew Mrs. Randle committed suicide in her Mutley house in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to bind her and tighten her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
He moved to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said of her, that after being a great surfist and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renunciated life."
In April 2007, her true father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is supposed that Mrs. Rande had killed herself soaking through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's patron, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes saying: "I used to bond her and open her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: “You’re a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when I was just seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking away her own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she hadn’t done it, probably the matter’t have ended at the courts.”
And he added: "I noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
A police officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be accused under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a job trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being delivered to the police.
It is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention of delinquering.
BBC's Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise for many in the British administration.
“They thought it was an internal issue between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, which cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Law, the clause that refers to the protection of the information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be accused by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the security forces’ capacity in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face B&B prices
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than £80,000 after the rescue/saving of the Bradford and Bingley banks.
The government, in fact, provided 14 trillion pounds to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savings.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
Director-General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers “humiliating” that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the 14 trillion loan should be refunded after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are removed.
However, the interests that are deposited in the internal, are supposed to be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
by Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there are no data that indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will have the need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price," said Mr. Cole.
The interest in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demanding interests, which may be almost twice the number.
As the construction companies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, whether through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises by 5 pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey Street will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pences per litre from next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following the research carried out by a consultancy company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February, was in 2002.
Previous articleBangladesh’s former Prime Minister has been refused
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the request for freedom under fiance for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him freedom under fiance accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729.700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various accusations of corruption.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released under fiance in early this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, military supported, grant him first full freedom.
The correspondents say that as long as she was given conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what are the terms of her release or if she will be able to stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the petition for freedom under fiance for Sheikh Hasina claiming he could not obtain freedom under fiance because he was already in treatment abroad under conditional freedom," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
“We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.”
Her defenders argued that she needed freedom under fiance to return to her country from abroad and prepare for December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive some medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are accused of.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccine campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations conducted a vaccine program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it could not reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite the taliban’s promises that they’t have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while they were taking the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge at the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Court that it will have to reduce its share of 17.9% in ITV by below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said BSkyB’s interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office that the acquisition of participation in ITV by BSkyB armed doubts about the independence of ITV, and pushed the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin’s boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, why, BSkyB said, would have delivered its voting rights.
New Investigation in the Assumption of American Lawyers
The U.S. Prosecutor General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the General Inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the action by the officials of the administration.
The report criticized the White House officials, the legislators and former General Producer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials interrogated during the investigation had lie to the researchers in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Graves complaints of possible criminal behaviors have not been fully investigated or resolved," Prosecutor General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their functions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was known that lawyers had not assessed themselves worse than others of their colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, congressional high-profile members, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and trial judicial cases for the government
They can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the dismissals, renounced his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The General Prosecutor’s report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, and emphasizes how he had a “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, who “abdicated” his leadership position and was “notchly not collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Epic of Great Honour
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for her epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "a honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking the nominations for this year’s prizes and making the ranking of the four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of the Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that exceed time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity like that used by Meat Loaf.
A two-minute instrumental section opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained about nine years in the rankings and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical surgery for his heart rhythm in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it came out that he had a quist on his vocal corner.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, bulevars, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-term local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the north of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This callecita, more or less than 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a street dust more than an active path.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on the First Street
that wants to repaviment Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the stores and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-dated neighbors who commented to be delighted by the truncated road simply because it is one of the last remains of the block's past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has the control of the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee for Land Use that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon agency drawn up a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to stay in the city, asked for a new plan that will be submitted next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the Community District Manager No.3.
“The city is today the owner of very few spaces and we would like it to continue possessing Extra Place,” she said.
“We can consider proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street arose for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to possess it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Conservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city’s desire to sell the street and observed that the agency’s mission is to develop the property more than to manage that.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of Bowery, Extra Place has left a footprint in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large property was divided among his sons and this narrow branch of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, is opened at Extra Place, but the street is best known by the photo of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
“It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, cartels, leaves, curves.”
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village’s overwhelming, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even if modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, practically unchanged piece, a city raja that should be protected.
Jeremías Moss, who directs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a city history talk about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow and output-free street, also dark by the day and marked by oxidated iron warehouse doors and counter-ventars, with old weekly newspapers swallowed along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat curated through the back of the street and stopped near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now welcomes a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and a bottle of empty beer near 22-oz were near a new lot of rejected newspapers.
Some passers said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that it could be given a cleansing.
Mr Fields, on his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
“I’ve spent the best years of my life,” he said, “in dark, wet, and dark places.”
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California Studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling the Spanish voters effectively is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African-Americans and Latin students have significantly less chances of graduating than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “the transitional bilingual education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in canceling the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the immense majority of students are Spanish and family with low income:
More than one-third of students, many of whom recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100% of the fourth year students, has been evaluated positively in the 2008 mathematics exam.
And almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s favourite.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, the constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the Chief of the Sixth Street, the school’s approach to the teaching of English to students is in the “total immersion”.
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the processing of the contents of the instructions.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “we’ve had extraordinary successes with students like this last who has arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later, you’d not be able to pick up what it was.”
“It works,” he said, “we believe it works.”
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large population of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of their party politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been defenders of bilingual education) and their same constant support for bilingual education dark the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue leaving people should stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close lagoons, he should carefully consider the educational models that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
Oil prices drop after economic fears
Oil prices dropped drastically this Monday due to the concern that the U.S. rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The crude oil shares fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets of basic products have been shocked by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before falling back again, due to the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety took over investors, once again, on Monday, despite Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was shaded by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from ending.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process, confirms that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation’s banking operations, according to what the government said Monday.
Meanwhile, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frenetic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement “as it seems not to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for basic products, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The prospects for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates will be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most sharp concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China.”
The bank’s analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the oil and gas price reduction forecast is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team set a record
After having spent, during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone else in Jets’ uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things were developing in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without a note into a game of disinflating.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis commented.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with scary under the shadows of the clouds.
At this time it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre met Laveranues Coles making a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect for a afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a great jump forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one of which when one cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that went to Coles.
“He’s a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing in the press, the Cardinals' defense abused the quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last turnover, the faults forced by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20 yards kick to win a final 34-0.
These are the greatest points that the Jets never did in a room.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter? "
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Gebrselassie headed its world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest rider in history, overcoming his own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 miles race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the accommodating race on 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in an impressive length race so that he has set a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter hour race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie didn’t take part in the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing – too alarming, in retrospective – that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he went to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing in the middle term some cuts 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calambres in the shoulder two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left it fresh, not oxidated.
“I’m very happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end everything went well.”
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the African-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his races, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the marks as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not decrease the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyan, Gebrselassie reached the half of the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenia elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their scores decreased.
But shortly three miles before the goal, Gebrselassie took a last push to separate from Kwambai, who ended second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi reached the third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also didn’t take part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best staff record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation race, leaving a quarter of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and the evidence of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the brilliant, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very obvious.
Eatonville, the first completely black-habited city incorporated into the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 color men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and neither a prison."
It is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to tribute tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And, however, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by its inclusion into the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, worthy and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who doesn't know what's going to be losing."
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has attracted attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of the race, many continue to be cautious in front of the foreigner.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
“He has to be right.”
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historic model of the assertion of the black people and a community of 2,400 people living below a level of poverty double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaid example of the rural culture of the Black South – sometimes dishonored, others praised – that was born of slavery in America.
It is not surprising, if those who reside here are at the same time proud and reserved.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville actually started by Zora, as here no one calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her native city to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, barely out of Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of the black and human drama.
Having a cement face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then inside more private areas.
"Outside the road to the left hand," he wrote, "there is the modern maroon public school with its white finishes, its wellined gardens and playgrounds, careful by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sales drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitory rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to the autonomous government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
Of course, this Fodor did not do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized citing men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, “Some people didn’t like that.”
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as an excentric vivid who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, she did it without prior notice in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today is proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very pleased to see Zora,” says Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, balancing on his chair in a back yard with views over Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in printing.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only color woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, nor great public lectures.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her inheritance were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turmoil came in the '80.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-way road through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way street of the working community.
The expansion of the area of Orlando had already pushed the Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended him relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixture brought hatred about the community.
"Thro that season, a group of white boys walked around the city throwing orange and everything against the people who were sitting next," Mr. Franklin said.
“They also killed a girl once.
He was shot against a sand of the car.”
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honouring my race."
Residents say today that the degradation of schools, positive in some aspects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“The black kids were used to be embraced – I remember this – they were used to embrace the teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed beyond the prejudices, just as she did, with boying, confidence and lines like: “How can someone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don’t understand it.”
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it in the American canons.
The road project arrived just at the time when the most famous daughter of Eatonville went again under the reflectors.
And this time, the old neighbors of Mrs. Hurston saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began to plan a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road, would have been putting in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride,” said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
People out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (taking the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repavimented and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from the center of Orlando, you can sometimes feel like in a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90% of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A preliminary permission is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - such as the walls in the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working on the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for the bright red, still fear that her island community can be misinterpreted.
And, however, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of Christmas pride has also arisen.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old Twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, if they dare to go up here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other’,” says Alondra Kenon after going to the church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city."
Here, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the giant TV screens on Times Square, they’t realize they’d be in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee node offices that are above their heads, the bankers and the speculative fund managers that monopolize New York face daily with the worst “bad office day” since the fall of 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal chariots for tea through the streets and carrying muffins bandages for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between loading apartments buildings, just like human mules, with 50 excentric stamping t-shirts hanging on a juice through their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting on track for their meal to take in the morning, and it remains impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees are still waiting to stick for their bagel to the carries of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 5 pm in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a tail of more or less 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers throughout their lives order their checks, tourists seek instructions to go to the big Macy warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “personal trusted banker”, and they were on the slope for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from which they had moved them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken out their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a building society), from the credit unions and savings boxes in their hometown whose branches only work within the state of belonging, and they say they treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers went to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some $440 billion savings deposits, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and stores that were left in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe shelter, which is doing most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, talking by phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and his afflicted executive director, Dick Fuld, commented the matter familiarly as if they complained of a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifth and some conserge in uniform of my block of apartments, has changed the normal direction of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in funds of the monetary market.
The change is done, I’m not taking any risk.”
Muslim tombs profanated at the time Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated with the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Amberes, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs that represent the mosques with a red line that passes.
Police are blaming extreme-right extremists for profanating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that extreme-right political parties made huge profits in the country’s general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals rooted Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the tombs, but the researchers think this may have happened by the attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deep shocked" by the news of the profanation, which came to Muslim religious when the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is going to prepare for an introspection round after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which got almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign incentrated in the anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against the head pants and the burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
In his last meeting in Vienna, he talked about a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, indicate that the change occurred primarily by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel prohibition abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent's police made the ban on travel abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced the evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling abroad like France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd didn’t attend personally.”
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the register of sexual criminals.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
And it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date with seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter's individual case or possible parade place in the county.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting Kent’s inhabitants is the main concern of Kent’s police and we work in close collaboration to monitor the behavior of the sex criminals registered in the county and to minimize any risk that may exist for the public.”
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, between the ages of 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entrance and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he would return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Internal Affairs, was calm and glad to know that they had banned Glitter from traveling to France and Spain.
Capture the Master Out of Scene to Extract His Character by Günther Bauer
No clothes, no clothes, no clothes, no clothes.
The essence of the great flamenco teachers, deprived of concentration in interpretation to get the relaxed look of the man or woman.
On one side the artist.
The other person.
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in those moments alien to the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of a hand, disregarded because they won’t come out to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatrality of some positions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the Flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of Flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be people any but, by seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed “in the street” are artists able to transmit in scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists you don’t have to take pictures from the scene.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco.”
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1,997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and material remind the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic foundation of the image, conferring modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of dance, singing or touch in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captures with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the dungeon that makes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of seventy photographed artists.
The project has become a flamenco antology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exposed in the sample.
The passion for Bauer’s portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with “SportARTproject” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, know them and be able to enter an instant in their life, whether a long or short moment.
I think in photography the portrait is the hardest genre.
You find or face people, characters, which you sometimes don’t know, or who leave you just a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas reality.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that takes the title "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Fotómata, located in the number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda of Hércules, where you will be able to visit until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a fearfulness"
It’s ambitious in places that he still doesn’t know and verses about unknown matters, but yet, Mario Vargas Llosa is engaged in bringing forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as the protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favourite Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a temerity" and that "all indicates that he shouldn't write" the novel.
"If it was reasonable, I't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it ever," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen passing through the city of the Aqueducto to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the awareness of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found in front of himself a public delivered to which he was made very short the time in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, replied how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "read pleasure" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes "disciplinated way" to fill his "feat of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and reaching a lot; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are sustained.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I deny to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that this "there has effects" and "there makes people more unconformed", so he asked the writers "not to abandon the frivolity" and "assume responsibly" their vocation.
Climatology slows the Pozoblanco fair that also remains without shelters
The festival that closed the Pozoblanco Fair fee was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoners announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather climbs have been shaken with this fair, since finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to celebrate.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco closure.
Only Friday was a celebration.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out to his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante went out his two astats with greetings and an ear, which granted more the tends than his toreo.
That yes, worse yet was the July, which passed through the coss of Los Llanos without sin or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief faena, the bronze of a large portion of the audience was won.
A control in Álava in a furgonette with two thousand pounds of hachis
Five less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Armiñón (Álava).
The agents give the height to the two occupants of a furgonet and these undertake the escape.
His load, more than two tons of hachis, was not how to stop.
The agents persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The person arrested has been accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of Álava carried out a transport control in the N-1, their passage through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were ready to stop a furgonette for their inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated suddenly and the control jumped.
The agents started their persecution until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arcade, a moment when its two occupants jumped to flee to the race for a forest area.
The ertzains finally reached one of them and confiscated the 2,178 kilograms of hachis they carried and found after inspecting the furgonette, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with haches, so they were transferred to police departments for an exhaustive inspection and weighting of the drug.
In addition, officials checked that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the recorded in the furgonette documentation, so also the arrested was charged with a public document falsification crime.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as it has been said, and to determine the origin of the drug arrested.
The detained, A. A. J. of 28 years old, was transferred to police departments to carry out the corresponding diligences and will be available to the court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effects of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her performing strange maneuveres when trying to get out of her parking in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California Road Patrol.
The witness has detailed that about 16.30 hours, Locklear "was walking deep the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car from the parking lot forward and backward, and by going back passed several times above his glasses of sun."
Shortly after, the witness, who seemed to have not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned the emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the Police Patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“It seemed disoriented,” so the agents brought her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to make her a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative and the excess of alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "as officials observed at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some substance that has not been specified and entered local prison about 19.00 hours although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an anxiety episode and a depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The IU general coordinator and Deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the training that will take a decision on the case of the former Council of Youth and Sports of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of carrying out treats for family members.
"I for these things am very federalistic, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said on the action that the party will have to adopt with which to now council in the Sevillan consistory.
However, the leader of IU defended the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations on the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same line he emphasized that the training has “strict ethical codes for all public positions.”
'May's Blood, Garci's Epic Bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's National Episodes, José Luis Garci recreates the famous rise of the Spanish against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the turn of characters and the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interprets.
Blood of May, with a more than two and a half-hour footage, is launched on Friday in the cinematic rooms, to become the future a miniserie for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
Grand admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci says he has fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to ambition with the decorated and the suitcase adequate the portrait of "a overwhelmed Spain that was wrong of head for which to fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he said.
But the filmmaker is sorry not to have counted with a financing like Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya – more than the double of Blood of May – so he has not been able to play some scenes plasmated in a script signed alongside Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Back to Start, has incited in what is his usual form of work, the scene with the actors, with whom he usually essays before starting the recording and those who do not cast, for appearing "humiliating" and considering that "part of the director's office resides in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works."
Many of the interprets with whom he coincides in Blood of May repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar in four occasions – of which he won one – Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the own Blood of May, Seven French billar tables and the finally selected, The blind girasoles, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, “which is the one that must be known,” he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect prizes.
“In the beginning you think you work for postpartum, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you conform to making a movie more,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will tribute to a Sevillan dancer too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
He had an exciting life, pioneer of women’s liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman that marked a dancing and aesthetic revolution in Europe of between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed me this character and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to gather his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me flamenco.
So, "the dancing of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dancing of the serpent" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I’ve been told that my dance is also within this aesthetics,” he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabel in one in his shows, just as he did in "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whom his student was.
“Matilde makes Tórtola bigger, the character of maturity.
I’m happy that I’ve accepted to act in my work and I’m very honored for it.”
The assembly also contains the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi of Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal accompanying of this type of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also tells somehow the life of this woman that developed in places so distant, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to throughout Europe, since she lived usual in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s of those women who have an enormous influence at a given time and now no one knows and much less puts in value her work,” Bayón says.
The show will start today at 20.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recent Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is within the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the objective of commemorating the fifth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to its end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Chop of Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the International Congress.
Also, the Culture Council of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recent Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Existence of maliciousness", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and of all America, before the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
It was hard to give him an Oscar.
He has been withdrawn since 2007.
He knew he was very sick.
It has still been a crack for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and I now have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
No one was afraid of making ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of the cinema and the homeland had died in a dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue the men and very few beings to admire are left, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It encarnated for everyone a almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defendant of lost and gained causes, from the drug fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn dead by overdose to his home and organic food brand.
This is a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration blocked Hollywood without attending nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that he did not die a man but an era.
Another English, the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“We’ve left the list very high to all,” George Clooney, one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand of probability and of having a serious and remote private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even not possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try it, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but then he was married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he had the chances of not being.
“But why will I eat hamburger outside of the house, if inside I have a filet?” he used to jok himself.
In heaven he is proud that in the earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“From all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as the one of a devoted husband, a loving father, a requested grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics are held in Madrid and, after the failure of 2012, it may be in 2016.
I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect career was called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst career with a lot in which I have been.
A full of disapprovals that, of course, if they took it into consideration as an assessment and I would examine, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go by parts and from the beginning.
Dispropositions begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go earlier.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but if you’re already going to give it all (including the chip to avoid cakes in the race).
Well not.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first disappointment, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the shirt (second disappointment, because I need a XL size)
In which world do we live?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a detail compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the tail when arriving is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the bag.
More than 35 minutes lasted waiting, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to be expected, the race began and we had not yet left the bag, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
Moreover, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which joined with conatos of popular rebellion and assault to the caseta.
I think about 500 people will surely have lungs tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the ranking, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn’t mark me out correctly.
Of course, if I was asked for the perfect career, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receiver (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft has shown an advance of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without a lot of intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shooter to move through the company's campus) taking care of what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people are in the room, who they are – even remember what they carry – and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the show video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that it is not a company employee.
Ask him if he’s there to visit someone and tell him he’ll meet him soon.
Without a blue screen.
and impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we have been talking much above a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essential rather than commercial rubber charged, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, will already be for less.
All a finding taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extra" to Windows.
The change is grateful.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome came out to the network, I was one of those who added to the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many have accurately pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
Complete the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your grandmother.
It is true.
It will never disappear, but the “death” of the operating system must be thought not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What does half of the applications come into the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less charged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They need it desperately, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of the Microsoft employees’ restrooms in Redmond, early this month.
In the refresh machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search, our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather throwing to 2010.
Microsoft will seek the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone is more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio liked one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'El Padrino' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we get to list star appearances, we can get back to the image of that forced bigote that lifted weights in an ambulant circus.
In essence, it’s nothing more than the typical male interior t-shirt in cotton, cylindrical and handless.
The 'tank', which the speaking angles call, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles displays over all the others.
First, for its remarkable name - although familiarly it is known as 'Marcel' - that has to do with the sport because it receives its name, according to the legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
"La Marcel" highlights over the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort underwear.
It’s a bad thing to leave them like clothes.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me”
His enormous resemblance with his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Mónica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Sisters Cruz are taking very seriously their new fashion activity.
For Monica, they are much more than a beautiful and famous girl who lend her name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Curious and timid, wins on short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have designed my sister Penélope and I for Mango in this new season autumn-winter, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
This is a very intense, but at the same time exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and me love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; therefore we get many references.
Then, I really like to lose myself by a city and watch women how they go dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you’re a very polifacetic woman, right?
I think yes but, at the end, everything unites and has many bonds in common.
From childhood I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to hurry in my uncle’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attractions park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You already know that the dancers like to make our styles for classes and trials, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the dress is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, that yes, with a lot of respect to designers and professionalism.
You’ve been 30 years old, you’ve got a crisis?
What is going.
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted from childhood and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because the body asks me for it and, in addition, I want to be a young mother; this I don’t want to miss.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is to give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you’re pending for several premiums you made last year.
That’s how and I’m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman coming from the theatre, I am very impatient and anxious, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
To see what you look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a gateway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don’t say that.
I don’t want to go on a gate to make a model.
Simply, he called me Naomi Campbell, whom I know for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial parade for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show - I pulled two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don’t know that Naomi’s tender heart.
There are so many things about her that I, who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
In addition, I stay with that part so good in which she is involved.
He asked me to depart for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, then too.
To benefit the women of the third world, what it takes.
Drivers recurring to alcoholemia must install the ‘alcolock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last month in June and now appears included in the annual memory of the State General Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will have a duration of one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so this will also receive a road reeducation course.
In the experience, in addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Institute of Technology for the Safety of the Automobile (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the car drivers more than once for driving ebrios again catch the car.
Alcolock would prevent it because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol rate in sprinkled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abts; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than permitted.
The cost is more than 1,000 euros and will run on account of the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infraction by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure tends to administrative penalties for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they arise in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been experimentally implanted on some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of the Deputies will vote tomorrow a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install in the school buses this system, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program, landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force in which the Prince of Asturias travelled.
The sun was withdrawn but its rays were still forced to use the hand as a visera to see the real couple descend from the plane.
On foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
He had before asked by the street, the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish princes visited the city to formalize an official journey.
- Ah, very good, then you won't be able to go to the airport to charge at that time... She's from here or so...
“No, no, she is Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
Many are waiting in the hangar of the airport stick to the red carpet and to a military valley composed of 27 Navy soldiers who interpret the salvation of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', they had communicated to her that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a shock stop to the photographers before they go to the room in which the official committee is waiting.
At the door of the hotel in which they stay, one of the four major in the city, a dicarachera journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The best award for fashion
Per there is no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion prize, that Paris and possibly there is no live designer more exquisite and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new fashion talents.
It is awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango apparatus at number 54 on the Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost cried out of the excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and is just opened with 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, united with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided the jury of the contest, made us finish on a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart broken of sorrow and making of trips heart, for the recent death of his brother, put himself a costume of the House and some adhesions of ELAH, which cut the breath, and of the arm of his son Luis - a canon of two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the honours and is so gentle that he ended, alongside the Rotchil baron, without a jacket, because both had been borrowed to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of its own design - and for dinner transformed with a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we taught the ballet essay room and she, remembering other times, took one of the bars and made a "grand plie" hole.
Inés Sastre didn't stay on the walk through the palace dependencies, but before he taught us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez – another canyon that moves on a motorcycle – and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sabans, his towels and having ordered in advance, that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
This is life, c is life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 but 1000 plus a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And if it was little, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relax to the bookstores on September 30.
The awakener almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s still worse to imagine engulfed in the agitated rhythm that today’s life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaust and the problems of disconnection with the labour world.
No, the number rises to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from the yoga positions, the classic massage or the ‘spa’ treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a whole book a ‘menu’ of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores in the hand of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the sofa, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that has passed the day before, but to children who speak while sleeping.
The first time it happens, you probably get a shame, but it really doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep that is called somnilochios.
It is very common, especially in children and adolescents.
More than one has been told that he talked in the evening.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (one time in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once in months ...), the next day the child doesn’t remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis, or sleeping, but there is no reason to be so.
As we have mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever images, stress situations or over-excitation.
This is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It can be that you speak in a quiet voice tone, loose words, a murm or all the opposite (writing, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him out of this way.
We have said that it is a beneficial alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that are fearful or a bit violent.
With very nervous children and they hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some internal calm.
This will help the child to have a quiet sleep.
Once the sleeps appear, try to keep the calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what has happened.
useful advice
Do not wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore is resting.
Remember that if it is very angry during several episodes it would be convenient to consult or find out what is what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you say (which is not the most common), don’t fall into the temptation to make him an interrogation to sound him information.
You won’t get anything, because when you’re asleep, you’re not aware of how to organize your thought.
You will also hear what he says, but you don’t know what he is dreaming about to say that, so very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
This generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of victory in his field after a long period of shortage.
Without making a good match, the team created many occasions of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty to express themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann that broke the squad with a shot from far, Illhaeusern almost was going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn’t let the midfielder pass and we left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the mark for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well situated to pick the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhousiens goalkeeper will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the gardens a dozen minutes later and leave his team colleagues in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie won’t take advantage of the occasion and it won’t be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed a little to “compress” their defense, except in the last seconds of game during which, after an important flight, the ball passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before departure to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a round for Britain.
Faced with the protest of resistance by the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Britain and Normandy ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find there his representatives.
These promised to welcome him “with a constructive spirit” and hope that he “will come with concrete propositions.”
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the “crisis committee” created by the British fishermen to get measures against the increase in oil prices, which marks a record by reaching the 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of the sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firmly.
On Tuesday morning, they took operations to minimize the circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused assaults of 10 km.
Quiberon's sports port has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed on Monday their determination burning, by raining the alba, tires and wooden palettes in front of the fuel deposits in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Mancha, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting this Wednesday that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Britain fishermen don’t want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue,” because “fishermen didn’t leave,” and “they don’t want to move to Paris,” Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fishing Committee, said.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gasoline at a price below 0.30 euros per litre.
The Great Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of "Two Men and a Destiny" has died of a cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weighs in the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Embraer’s president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies a lot on the Chinese market especially to sell the aircraft that range from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble thanks to the U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the aim of refunding its loan of $85 billion, according to Sunday’s Financial Times edition.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the Insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in the private equity, the Financial Times added.
No definitive decision has been made about these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to refund its 85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the right proportion among current shareholders.
History of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost a 6.98%, a loss ever seen at the Stock Exchange of 800 points, and the Nasdaq a 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, that is the day when exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks on 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, technologically dominant, dropped 199,61 points to 1,983,73 units and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index to 8,81 % (i.e., 106,85 points), to 1,106,55 units, according to the final closure figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street drowned after the House of Representatives' unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to recover a little stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
"This is not a good signal sent to the market, that he sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
“This shows how far the market was counting on this plan,” Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within a few days will come “too late.”
"If the project is really deadly (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the rally (the U.S. central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions more," said Brian Bethune, Head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the feeling of urgency, "every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated drastically, which caused emergency interventions in the benefit of the banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that the markets face “not only a crisis in the U.S. but a global crisis,” added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The bond market has grown drastically.
The yield of the 10 year treasury bonus declined 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30 year bonus 4,161%, against 4,357% on evening.
Obama wins the first TV duel
On Friday's first debate between the two candidates in the White House happened another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign chartels proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that has been followed by one-third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers that John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "every brilliant" to allow him to stop his drop in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey published last Saturday gives five points of advantage for Obama (the 49% against the 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who came out well.
Among the indecised voters, who are those who count, Obama came out winner with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good expected performance of his candidate member, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton said this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy, emphasizing the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were in the heart of this first care.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,” he also said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in the Republican television advertisements.
Obama said it represents the future.
Without disconcerting, it was concise and accurate.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it,” he replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for a election meeting in North Carolina under a rainy rain.
“The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipient.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," estimated yesterday the influential and Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration monster, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” with Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy carried out by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that it would, despite all, get to reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite the highlights of Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was its first priority, with the creation of a system of safety and health.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by this year by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates escaped the issues that referred to the $700 billion (470 billion euros) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely impopular.
“In Minsk, “Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?”
Youth and opponents demonstrated on Sunday afternoon at the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject with anticipation the results of the legislatives.
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centers in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislatives.
While no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Loukachenko: “the dictator has to resign.”
Some acknowledge not to have voted: "for why, since they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made good face to foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the visa prohibition for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
“We have been placed next to the electoral committees and our observers couldn’t participate in the counting of the votes,” Iouri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, regretted a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some opposition members enter the parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
"But their entrance to parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and proposals of law."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because “the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts to Russia, enters a crisis, and if we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He emphasizes that the numbers of participation seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote with anticipation (the 26% of the voters in Minsk) favoured the manipulations.
Ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition to the parliament, those who best fit to power.”
The silence of the night returns again at the October Square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate for their success.
Review: Blood Is Back Safe
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the public's confidence that had been seriously vacillated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Canadian government made in February 1994 a public survey, headed by judge Horacio Krever, which intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster should not be reproduced anymore.
While Judge Krever was delayed to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
According to Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood to supply all the other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec,” Decary recalls.
The situation was disanimating.
After doing a lot of effort to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have recovered the public’s confidence,” he says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, 94% of the Quebec population had in the successive confidence in Héma-Quebec.
Dr. Decary reminds, however, that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the principle of precaution.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the crazy cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we don’t know it and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated out of doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of precaution that was applied was meaningful.”
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the antibodies against the virus, in which the tests used so far were founded.
Nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We could reduce this period to less than a week.
We thus substantially decrease the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in every 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“This means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So as Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product survives.
I think you can today receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concerns,” said Héma-Québec head of the headquarters.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Island of the Meeting, which, for example, the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Decary pursues before emphasizing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec should also predict a sufficient supply.
“The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or tablets.
The population aging also has consequences on the network of blood donors that regains by average term only 3% of Quebecs admissible to blood donation.
All people with good health, aged 18 and who meet the criteria of admissibility can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Penurias are very rare.
But members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it’s hard to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today’s life is very untouched, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate their blood,” Francine Décary afflicts.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone injections, heart valves, eye balls and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
“We’ve celebrated a few weeks ago, the placement in the bank of our millennial blood sample of the umbilical cord and is expected to get out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for injections at the beginning of the coming year,” says Doctora Décary who describes this cordon blood take program as very popular.
“Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this,” since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Impact of Montreal qualified for the semi-finals of the USL's first division eliminatory series, thanks to a victory by 3-1 (4-3 in summary finals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the series of quarters of final, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, midcampist David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who scored Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first match of the round and round series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the back match to take it by 4-3, but the Whitecaps accessed in the semi-finals by 5-4.
The Impact should face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian to the barrier free shots against the Florida Panthers, yesterday night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aid, and Kovalev picked a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
“I’m not ready yet, the Russian government has warned.
“I need another game to feel comfortable.”
He tried to play the maximum in the first time, notes Guido Carbonneau.
I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest occupies the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude to launch elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to make himself elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They parade, in three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric packaging, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
The media as during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The “North Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, the “new economic space”, which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in Prime Minister's discourses recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself yet to explain why the North was “a jewel to the immense potential,” but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: the hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains “niquel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond,” according to Mr. Charest’s enumeration.
This “territory twice as large as France” is our home, it is in Quebec.
It’s not only at our home, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as to show that he demanded a national founder myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he emphasized: the ride towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after having made a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 percent of the Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, Prime Minister said during the press conference.
“It’s a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I repeat that position from the part of the government,” he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we have to re-think our Northern vision," he said speaking of the northwestern passage, which will open every year due to the flooding of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers that come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Quebec party member of Ungava), have already started consultations around a thirty communities.
A interministerial committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit ", but a meeting in which "there will be given a common vision ".
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be concerted, ordered and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as one that is in continuity with that of the first liberal ministers that preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities of growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to emphasize the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the power of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to reboot the Central Beauharnois at Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay James our party knew to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Speaking on the topic of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric packaging project, Mr. Charest stressed that its launch is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I am planning to be there," he told his militants, raising applause.
Effectively, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and not in 2009, did not discard the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows him.
He emphasizes that his schedule is yet full, due to a Federation Council mission in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The general council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, "constitutional aspirations" that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec claims in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
She also wishes that Quebec appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the big lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
Quebec party leader Pauline Marois highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, arriving at power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done it, "we would make progress today," Mr. Marois commented alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this isn't just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Posts Tagged: a dishonored country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) at Harper's cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "vergue" for Canada.
To thus dishonor this woman who carried an incessant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration what says everything about the relations of Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and leaves a boy-soldat living in unhuman conditions.
The only one who tells with a false justice to evaluate the accused's guilt.
Let’s remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support Omar Khadr’s repatriation in order that he enjoys the benefit of a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes the eyes on torture: little does it matter that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of exactions.
We still don’t realize that, but we see at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy”, that’s the word that Harper continues to repeat and that has no meaning.
It has already arrived the time when no more morality exists: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the chief of government wants to be minority (what will happen after October 14th ?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that encompasses the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they don’t see that this government has renounced what the reputation and dignity of our country did.
Mr. Toews the shame is caused by this resignation and by nothing more.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest aurífer company tried a six-million-euro diffamation process against three authors and a small editorial house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by diffamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to hurt anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his?
The result of the trial has little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very inequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost unfounded of the mining.
The tactic, in these inequal struggles, is often consists in ruining the prosecutors in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will amortise the opposition in addition to scared anyone will dare to review the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are usually made by the change of ideas and not by garrot shocks.
It was therefore enough for the mining to open its books, its records and establish a true debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to rely on the public opinion and rejects the petitions and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Per Mr. Garver could explain how he can ask for a “public” debate by disregarding his opinions?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word merits only very paid lawyers and not all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or what he doesn’t want to understand – is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does it above all because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and to judge him, but having as a basis civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-small (pursuing the “public debate”, Barrick Gold just deposited a claim with respect to the authors of Noir Canada intimidating them to not use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to quote credible sources and to make a debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that disagree the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s unmeasurable persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to place devices that limit this genre of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to remove the financial crisis that shocks Wall Street for months has to be still confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for: a better control by the elected of its implementation, of new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the refund of the public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of houses embarked the lack of payment, as well as a right of supervision on the wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiation table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a negotiation marathon that lasted two days.
“We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective on the markets,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover the economy and the ordinary Americans with the current crisis in Wall Street,” the Democrat explained.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of the Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the humour of investors.
The last time that had been fixed was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential elections, who have adhered late to the negotiations, showed themselves rather favorable to the deal, without forgetting yet to express their dissatisfaction of being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama gave him certain provisions to reach the agreement, the one that would allow owners to preserve their home and the one over the salary of the leaders of the companies surviving by the state.
“When the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, Interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
“The important points I read [most] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable.”
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with the money of the taxpayers the doubtful debts, the risky and invendible assets of the U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgage credits before spreading to other more common forms of credit bonds (PCAAs) and provoking a liquidity frozen and a banks and financial institutions dismissal.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had made the first draft agreement change, last week.
We believe that we have gone out of the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of the difficulties are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of limiting the uncertainty for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new taxes that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 billion more will be added if the president finds it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
In exchange for their aid, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm will pass.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargation procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans according to this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and on metallic compensations paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would want to see it subject to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber’s financial committee, told his voters that “with all evidence, Washington doesn’t want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists in taking advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economists, including three Nobel prizes, wrote to us to say: We ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to take,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we had again the test of the world nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas had announced that it had renounced buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost €2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the risk real estate loans crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurance companies.
“This is not money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
Instead, we recover a right of vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savings and families would appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take care of all loans pending at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75,5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander has announced that it is the one who will buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Was the American actor with a charming smile released from his narcissistic side?
Yes and No.
His pudor, his sensitivity and a talent that was obvious will also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
What a great background corner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at the age of 83, due to a lung cancer in his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom it seemed a lot and who was considered for a long time as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No unmeasurated ego, the last brand of quality.
Because in it a whole country was projected in love with the self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and soon in the cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we don’t know very well, are also disappearing with it.
He is an honorable man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while his great papers in the black screen of the memories were shocked.
More than a half-century of the seventh American art in perpetual shift parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Nearly to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that failed to fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed into the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangant in the soundtrack film The Sting (The Strike), Oscar for Best Movie in 1973.
Bitter billar player and vendor in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's Color of Money, which won him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
The face that changes with the years is he.
Still he.
The times change during his career.
Young people know it above all thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last Iranian mafia patron role in Sam Mendes's Road to Perdition in 2003, the rice was scratched.
Contrary to several film legends that soon abandoned the career, Newman left a lot in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humour, "as a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and that judges his performance too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he less often interpreted the role of young galans than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, cabrons or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebels.
As a director, Newman revealed side by side his true pudic sensitivity not very well known.
Her film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female portrait of melancholia.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdose dedicated him his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of humility and sadness.
Among the numerous tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (have worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other hand of his legend career, he is also hidden a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestant against the Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the boots of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to its Foundation for Childhood in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than satisfied with his myth, will have committed to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "As long as and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of a American artist so lucid and so generous.
It is a model citizen.
What were they producing in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. facturation factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his complices will begin.
The politician and his complices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in a organized way, in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in public competitions justified in many occasions the fulfilment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUFs - stopped in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in public competitions with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the accusation, most of the bills were false.
For this they obtained the talonaries in the Józsefváros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the falsified invoice was to be made was decided among others in that tour by the Higher Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for his consumptions and these served as a model to make the bills they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his complainant András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a beer shop.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its comrades, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people don't fit at the same time in that place.
Likewise, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation – later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért – was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there for one night, but in the invoice there were a hundred and thirty people.
But the facturing manufacturers of great fantasy also exaggerated when they pointed out to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. since in the library of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, told hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he already knew it was false documents.
“In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place.”
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the invoice 100 people were housed, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people are located.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, while the restaurant has long failed to work.
Facturing enthusiasts were not informed either that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organizes exclusively travel abroad, so in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency's facturing practice.
In addition - as it was known during the investigation - they included the VAT in the document as well, despite the fact that travel outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of said company are not charged with a 25 but only 15 percent of VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended machine-made invoices but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "expedients" made other errors as well, as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out by road transport to which - it was known during the prosecutor's investigations - the company founded as an investment consultant does not.
Equally by formal differences – inadequate form of the invoice, false seal – it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
Like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, therefore the commissioner of the liquidation process – according to our information – denied having issued such a document.
Consciously issued the bills.
Another group of fake bill manufacturers are made up of those who were aware that they should issue fake bills.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued a bill worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft, currently under liquidation process, also collaborated with Zuschlag and its comrades, which in 2003 supplied invoices for approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no capital movement either, since afterwards they cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to make this entity listed in their documents.
In the following group of the manufacturers of false invoices include those who have some connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the prosecutor of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with fictional headquarters in Budapest, which was engaged in fuel and vehicle trade.
The company issued numerous invoices for an approximate value of 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also delivered the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount he himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian albaniles at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively due – according to the accused – that they did not receive a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his complice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave in total 15 invoices to different entities for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Prosecutor's Office found that Kubatov received the VAT and 10% of the bills.
That man even took advantage of the company in commandite Szi-Beri to issue fictional invoices used in the contest of Biztos Pont.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), the Socialist Party’s public utility entity.
They received 500,000 HUF from the contest respectively, but did not use the money for the goals of the contest.
For this not to be discovered, they presented to TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting thing can be the confession of the main accused himself, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: what interest has it to do? because in exchange for the return of most of the money – fifty million HUF – the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could offend, since to relieve his prison conditions requested domicile arrest, but he was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous authors of economic crimes of very higher value, who never returned the money, pass freely or at least can wait at their own home the judgment, he has no possibility for that.
Psychology of overwhelming: Why do we spend more money?
Participants in the auction are likely to spend more money and overvaluate the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study appeared in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental discounts.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and while examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games they could earn money the participants, but during the auctions, where it is the fundamental element to bet more than the other, by losing the game was intensified the operation of the complex called stretch located below the brain cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto-premium" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention to not cause an intense reaction of the stretch.
To fundamentate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply communicated the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group, in addition to this, was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group that played "contra failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any previous economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of the auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so now we get to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world about five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary the chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
The denomination of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; the liver infection and icterism are characteristic, but their pathogens and caused diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (for example with water or food contained), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humors (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
It is recommended for travelers to be protected by vaccination against the virus A and B, against the C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming infected food, manifested by a general bad condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear on the skin and on the white of the eyes the icterism, the excrement is made clear, the dark-colored urine and healing can last even two to three weeks.
Every year a million people die in the world from hepatitis B-caused cancer and liver cirrhosis, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people don’t know they’re sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical control is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and those who carry tattoos.
Today there are about 200 million people worldwide suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory control too, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so you can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representative of the sick.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt anyone who believes in God?
According to the results of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious beliefs influence human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the framework of this singular experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the pain regulation.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which alongside the academics participate also scientists, philosophers and theologists of the different departments of the University.
The analysis took place in the following way; they fixed a scratching instrument on the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their look in two paintings; the 17th century Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary and the 15th century Leonardo da Vinci's Army Lady.
The researchers had the hope that the show of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious mood among the faithful, as they chose Leonardo's oil because it wasn't too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
The patients spent half an hour on a MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts while observing the painting of religious or the other theme.
The Catholics affirmed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in “safe” as “protected” people, “they calmed themselves and in their heart reigned peace.”
When they watched the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they watched Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can get a similar effect with the atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
“We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“Exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have for pain regulation if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or of another painter of its size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you say about yourself.
On his twentieth birthday, Google can say: he can be found both in the pocket of people, as well as in the sky above his head; he knows where they spent their holidays, what doctors they visit and what is what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, the skeptics who make a parallel with the orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in one system all the information of the world!”
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that revolved the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
At the question what’s going to happen in five years Schmidt answered as follows: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would be the job that best suits me?” – however, the software will not be able to answer apparently so simple questions as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their network browsing, the searched keywords, IP addresses and the pages they passed through are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, can again consult what they searched before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches – on this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned with seeing Google's informative monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be scary and not regret, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a already confirmed fact that not only retain, but in justifiable cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of the internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google delivered to the Brazilian government the information on its website, Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
Instead, people who are worried about the rights of people, in May relieved when the company together with the EFF, an electronic rights organization, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, it cannot be forced to Google, through no of the points of the constitution to supply any type of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law approved years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor even the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide your personal data because they think that your privacy, your private life is damaged by starting to use Google’s services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiasts followers, internautes and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avanguard corporation", not so to its rival, the Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as the Conqueror of the World, no matter how both struggle for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because the geek see accurately the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that was just produced by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, to leave intentional footprints behind us and take advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young man can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of his music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which automatically appear the latest photos galleries that are stored on the Flickr or Picasa.
We can know numerous cases of which it is revealed that, for example, the girlfriend, by seeing the next morning flow of photos of common friends, understands who spent the previous night with her fraudulent boyfriend or can dismiss the employee of a company because this writes her sincere opinion on her blog about the company’s direction: one thing is safe, the definition of private life has been revalued completely.
A person's "on line" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that is hiding behind the behavior of the youth of our days.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to escape Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but doesn’t leave footprints).
There are many people who don’t want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but Google’s “on line” apps can be replaced, from text writing software to image and news reading apps with alternative versions which do not connect to giant servers nor prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
The public opinion almost openly awaits the day that Google will show its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agencies’ revenue, as the services that are increasingly rapidly introduced cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions too: for example, the top management routinely rejected the employees' protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' feed, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave up to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered all information that violated the good morality and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company’s internal regulations says they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it’s already ready to work, which if it’s sure is that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolve the World: while some believe that Google’s scan and book and magazine file project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google will create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, the popular novel of Cory Doctorow, describes in orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google’s data can be described alarmantly well.
Two minors helped remove the footprints of the author of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
Police have interrogated two minors about the double killing of Oz who, according to founded suspicion, helped remove the traces of the crime, the spokesman of the General Commissioner for Public Order of the province of Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people recognized the crime they were accused, and now they are accused of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency's information it is about two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of Oz's double murder - a 23-year-old man - is in preventive detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and covetry.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owes a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditors at the headquarters of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then killed also the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, since he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the place of the crime.
Police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for a hundred percent of the Stock Exchange’s shares.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Stock Exchange of Prague, said last week that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Stock Exchange of Warsaw and did not discard the possibility that with it, in a future the Stock Exchange of Prague would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the agreement of the shareholders could be sold about 90 percent of the shares.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the increasingly deep international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 of September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president – the Republic of Rome – the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the draft law made promptly, whose objective is to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", of which multi-millionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more correct to talk about a "second 11 September."
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the expiatory chivo.
According to El Mundo, the error of the U.S. political direction was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system increases and this will then impact the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after Congress voting arises the danger that Washington doesn't offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – just when one of the greatest transformations in capitalism’s history is carried out.
This threat cannot be omitted, says the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw a ceiling of saviors to the bankrupt financial institutions, thus being able to save them from the bankruptcy with the taxpayers’ money.
But if as the dominoes break down more bank yet, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is long-term that Member States of the European Union need to ignore their nationalist egoism and centralize control over the fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received just on Monday more than €100 billion – reminds Vienna’s Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are increasingly real.
Until now, the EU has not been seriously dealt with the crisis that passes as a coname on the Old Continent.
The "savers" will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is justified to use the funds of the taxpayers to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the bear
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the sensors of obstacles existing in nature?
For example, the bees.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, beekeepers gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C car robotic direction system, which was given the characteristics of the bees, with the final goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each beef creates its own private oval space that actually looks very much like our safety protective capsule – explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
The composite eyes of the bears are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the length measurement system by laser rays.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot imitating the movements of the bears, modifies the direction by turning in the necessary measure the wheels.
Unlike any system currently existing, this maneuver is completely instinctive.
“If not so, the vehicle’s robot could not react quickly enough to escape the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It should react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable interior layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a beef does to avoid other beefs.
This process should be done with an opening and closing of the eyes.
However, unlike the bears, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the rotation direction of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for beekeepers to escape other beekeepers, here they only used as a possibility for the auto robot the rotatory movement and acceleration in addition the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, meaning they have a longer life than the lithium-ion battery.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, not much less that of storage.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store these data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuver, so it uses just a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately escape the obstacles, which according to Nissan’s calculations, within ten years will be able to be incorporated into the series-made models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles on his way.
This lovely child has a name.
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package law has been prepared that will be applied in several stages with the purpose of buying bad credit from banks.
In the first stage, half of the money will be spent.
According to Eastern coast time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, Congress leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters.
"We've made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, saying it's only necessary to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the result of the commitment said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (or before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular jump on the stock markets.
On the draft law called the Emergency Law for the Economic Stabilization of the Year 2008, on Monday first will vote the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
We are pleased with the progress achieved during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy poor quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, of poor rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion will be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, in addition to other “poison” credits as well.
The purchase may be made in auctions or in direct form - informed the ministry's competent persons.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the predictable damages.
Henry Paulson said: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach even $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, to be the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it – he added.
Instead, the chiefs of the banks who are in trouble and are waiting for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the U.S. argot calls simply gold falls.
Only in some specific cases payments will be limited, in addition the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry purchases in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for the gold falls, unless the bank's failed boss is praised.
By directly buying the bad credits the government will act aggressively to ensure that the boss compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer to only the new contracts to stimulate the participation in the program.
This is the first case in the U.S. history that a legal limitation for the revenue of the general directors will be in force, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress committee, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the program, so the risk of the taxpayers will be reduced, since they will eventually even be able to obtain profits with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the draft law in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposition on how to return taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the US citizens ordered us, that is, the dollars are not being protected from taxpayers, California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures urged him the same that are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Internal sales prices in the processing industry sectors increased minimally, with a 0.1% compared to July.
The greatest increase in the price magnitude occurred in August 2008 in the leather and shoe production sector (2,8 per cent), primarily due to a monthly 4.6 per cent increase in bags and belt and a 2.5 per cent increase in shoes.
The highest price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in chemical production branch prices (1.6 percent).
A price decrease occurred in the petrochemical sector, (1,4 per cent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0,9 per cent), as well as - in a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0,1 per cent).

In the rest of the processing industry sectors, prices increased between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first due to the effect of the rise of official prices from 1 July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period – in the domestic sales of the processing sectors – the highest price rise was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal manufacturing sector there was an increase of 13.2 percent, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.

Will you no longer need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian agreement on visa exemption to enter into force around January 12 - the Foreign Minister talked about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians residing there.
In his opinion, “practically everything depends on the fact that the electronic access and control system is built in time on the other side of the Atlantic.”
At the same time he warned that the new system will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice delivering the Middle Cross with the Star of the Republic of Hungary’s Order of Merit and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisors of the presidential candidates, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank’s financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, said on Sunday their support for the government’s $700 million banking aid program, while there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after a few days of marathon negotiations, on Sunday morning announced: a principle agreement was reached on the bank’s financial rescue package.
The financial package tending to solve the Wall Street crisis and decongel the frozen credit market, became the central topic of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, by putting the economic issues in the forefront, Obama again obtained some advantage and disappeared the advantage McCain had obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice-president.
In a Detroit campaign meeting held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly approve the bill on the $700 billion package.
He emphasized that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and with responsibility (...) the employment, the savings of you and whole industries and the stability of the entire economy are in danger,” he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to qualify McCain’s economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that “we’ll all swallow this to hard penalty (...) but not doing anything simply isn’t a viable way.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a supervisory commission to the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the executive compensations, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted the minister daily.
Congressman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Journal of the German Speech Area
The right group is intact, only that within the group themselves the most conscious voters have become - says Der Spiegel on the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a Roosevelt coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devores its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed his office.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria – and now just these modern citizens are the ones that give it the back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was forecast for almost ten years ended: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU gained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consecutive modernization of the CSU in the devoring province of its parents.
However, the secularization, the results of education and settlement of the North German in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
With modernization, the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group themselves the voters became more conscious, more critical and more hard-working.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks just the conventional groups of citizens were those who took the most away from the CSU; the autonomous, the small industrial, those who have bachelor's degree and the graduates.
So the support for the CSU was reduced to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? in its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens in return still do not want to make consultations about the coalition.
The elections were held already, now everything turns around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely left to see some of their barracks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible – this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left pending the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He said that in any case they disapproved the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equality of Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France which this year is also the turn president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Deputy of the European People's Party for the Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, attracted attention about segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit the Gitan children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social interlocutors and representatives of the most important European organizations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, the Gitanians remain out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
“The majority of young Guitanians have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic teaching, only one insignificant part can obtain university degree.”
Járóka also highlighted that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevailing foundation of the other human rights as well.
Investing in the teaching of Chinese children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the eurodiputate, it is necessary to broadly awareness these issues both among the Gitan and among the non-Gitan.
For the earlier a Gita student starts school, the more chances will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
“Gythans, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and guaranteed the abolition of the segregated and low-level education,” Lívia Járóka said.
According to the deputy, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school degradation, for that it is of fundamental importance the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives.
“We have to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we have to offer the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights,” Járóka said.
The objective of the European Summit for Equality of Opportunities, organized annually since the last year’s Berlin Meeting held in the sign of the “European Year of Equality of Opportunities”, is to provide a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European and national level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be made about the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the severe electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut at the summaries of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in his positions, but it is unknown how long the grace will last.
The duo's luck, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so criticized duo left to see: they don’t attach so much to their positions.
Thus they intended to calm the angry members of their parliamentary group and their base organization, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career – the Social-Christian union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup attested against Stoiber, they only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a “monopoly” in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will surely have to make coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also has a position in the reduced intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that on the list of the Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelty deleted the scene to the ambitious local politics.
CSU’s top leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will receive an active role as well as Stoiber who so far was moving the rows in the background, the former provincial government chief and former CSU president qualified September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical observations to the CDU, in his opinion would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel itself too.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are unable to raise together the CSU that played a transcendental role in the 2005 national elections success.
According to Merkel that he could hardly hide his disappointment by the failure, CSU’s losses won’t negatively impact the great Berlin coalition.
What is naturally relative: it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU and the continued social-democratic crisis.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the election on Sunday, there will be no opposition member in the parliament of Belarus.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country Alexander Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the country’s legislature of 10 million inhabitants, integrated by a percentage and ten Deputies, has no opposition over a decade ago, before yesterday’s elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of doubtful legitimacy, as a result of the modification of the Constitution this time would “permit” the entry of some opposition Deputies in parliament.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that he originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition’s expectations was that Belarus, which increasingly economically depends on Russia – which took a credit to moderate Russia’s increasingly expensive natural gas imports and contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country – wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give entrance permission to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered antidemocratic.
It was a sign of distinction when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, placed emphasis rather on the positive phenomena and not on the errors – such as the prohibition of participation imposed on one-third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s Monday primary report criticized even the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that opposition could not be present in the counting of the votes.
With all this in the opposition’s opinion it feels a improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Osetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia – with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state – already a month ago considers the two regions as independent.
“We’ve made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun,” Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears to allow the entrance of even a opponent to that parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan to organize protests when it sees the results, rather it tries to make the voters get their message about the need to make economic reforms.
“This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that more and more are those who support the change among the elderly too,” said Milinkevich, pointing out that the Lukaschenko regime, who believes its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it suitable even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country’s debt and the increased trade deficit, it’s just a matter of time the decomposition of social security that “is like the silence of cemeteries” – said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, qualified the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: “People don’t believe in words but in facts,” so that the lack of opposition is nothing but the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From now, more and more breakfast before starting to work”
It has never happened in the History of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entrance and exit of staff.
But from today it begins with this measure against whom it is and then goes to the bar to drink a coffee in working hours.
This news has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“Automatic doors – says Brunetta – are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services,” the minister said.
"A new season of responsibility and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta emphasizes again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of the automatic doors is important also from the symbolic point of view."
No resistance has been found by the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been the collaboration of part of them."
No more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and lunch.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good capuchin at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
According to the Ministry, “in three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in a year.”
He added that it is necessary to make public administration more effective.
Italian, “which salary dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
For now, millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
“As the Minister of Public Function shows the numbers, the lowest absence of work due to causes of illness – writes the consumer association – the people of the ‘vague workers’ are continuously increasing.
“Millions are actually in Italy the correct and productive public administration employees who have joined themselves to declare war on the illegal rules of the decree.”
In particular, the Tar would address the exclusion of aggregated economic treatments due to illness due to service; the extension of the hours in which the medical inspection visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Labour Accidents, Napolitano: “Critial Prevention”
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 work accidents are verified, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that the white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost the double of deaths compared to the murders.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of the work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is,” said Republic President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
He expressed "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to the prevention in the workplace, the protection of the injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of the public opinion."
“It has been manifested, a ‘just’, sincerely shared, facing tragedies that, by their dimensions, raise the clam of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead the everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance take the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of the youth who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has emphasized “as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the consciousness of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to put an urgent end.”
“Data on work accidents seem to indicate a slight positive move, but this does not take that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,” said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t really want this ‘tendence to decrease’ to be translated into less attention, because it’s just when the attention decrease that exploits the tragedy.
“We believe that at the general level it is still done too little to counter the accidents phenomenon and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
More controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school, are needed, according to Mercandelli.
"A further effort serves - he added - as it concerns communication and awareness of the public opinion.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced “the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection for the victims of work” and “the assistance derivation towards which the system is being directed in recent years.”
“The goal is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – because the fortune of the accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time.”
MP3 readers under accusation, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
It is what the European Commission refers, that in a statement disseminated in Bruxel quotes the opinion of the Scientific Commission on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – arises that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music apparatus weekly for more than one hour a day having the high-volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am worried that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From scientific evidence – the EU’s responsibility follows – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters is to raise awareness of consumers and render this information of public domain.
We need to review, in addition, the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the passage with the new technology.”
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable music apparatus and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that that originates.
"The scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that it is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from the noise exposure from portable music devices and related devices."
Currently, there is already a European security standard that limits to 100 dB the noise level of the portable music devices, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can be derived from an excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and time exposure to noise.
According to its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that if users of portable music devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for just 5 hours a week, they exceed the current limit for the maximum noise consented at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors closed in March, the council and the municipal council evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasize Germanno – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the council and the municipal council, will then be able to advocate.
There is no surplus position of roles, only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March completed the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise deadline.
In June – announces the intendent – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission’s work for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To whom the Commission accuses of uselessness, given that its opinions are not binding, Germanno replies: “Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to perform and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, your contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is shrinking in ordinary management and in emergencies that turn back to manifest.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long run, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
The intendant of Rome tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens and it will serve to make participation and reason the best minds that the capital expresses."
For Germanno, effectively, "it needs to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic jump of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unitary spirit to its future."
A future that, precises the intendent of Rome, "will not be limited only to the current municipal boundaries but to look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama is the first anti-American president.
He wrote an American politician who is interested in passing for independence: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam.”
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the election is approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a Web: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he believes he will win the highest post in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!
In fact, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly racist attacks and don’t answer the voters’ question: Will he be a good president?
There are people who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the entrances of the south of the United States, has written a editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know well to whom the American patriot will vote.
One side of the American mentality is covered up to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll then think where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we’ll leave America.
Things never said before now, that seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: What were the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89% have answered: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent it home on the back.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags.
Also, Iraq for the majority has been Bush’s weakness.
Whoever will take the position of George W will have an enormous duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse makes it feel also for journalists: in the newspapers it’s time of cuts. Many blame the Internet, “assassin” of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated to feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is the money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the writers work to make the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to interviewed journalists, if it is not desired that traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands is substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Print against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many viewed as the "assassin" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has risen to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embraceing technology in the hope "that it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest breakthrough today in American journalism is between who directs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage is down to 23%.
For some, this has to do with ‘work safety’.
The executives who think of losing the job in 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the journalists it is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our writers, ndr) in America is always on the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of “taking it or leaving it.”
The directors almost always receive good wages, while the writers can earn up to $10,000 a month, but the retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "healing" followed during the year.
It’s all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: DANIEL COPPOLA IS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the field of the investigation on the counter-pact relating to the escalation Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the arrest process at his office, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate could travel the city route from the province to a capital room.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has given the opposite vote) would allow you to influence your society and access the evidence that accuses you.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation by the New York Times of yesterday informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, in turn, conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of finance, strong above all in the states of the Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that has become prepotent with the vote of whom he spoke at the beginning.
This barely mentioned is just an example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
Both in the United States and Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovernment in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, effectively, is a crisis of banking institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside, but above all, the balances of the families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for the one who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don’t have much to say: the crucial proof is the European Union that divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach to decide any policy in common.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expecting an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the funding subsidy: from the moment it reaches the court it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remediate things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization will never have the same amount.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect synthony, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very connected to that element: the territoriality.
Paradoxically, as we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated, immaterial technology, as we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to make accounts more and more with the less immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
Everything that, look, can be transported from one place to the other of the earth but is equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign, he possesses many more letters regarding whoever is not, and whoever has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I get to the second novelty, but it predicts a fraction.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for a leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of unsuitable economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense unpleasant: a discretion, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire leading class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far on the rise, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have done the same time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a short word, feeds undergroundly a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and of the traditional political structures, which are manifested in a “revolt” electoral or in the sudden changes of collective humour of these recent times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and lay also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do).
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say somewhat, make it always more difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today that is taking shape are the deep strates of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially agits unmeasurably.
In front of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having the eyes open is not.
The super stick to walk over the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super stick and in a future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has approached quite.
With a stick of just 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to stick a body of 100 pounds on a vertical wall.
The American Science magazine has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of sticking can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the feet of the gecos, covered with microscopic hair that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon, and liqueous paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time"sweep easily out of the walls," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electric current conductors.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
There are no superheroes for now.
Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicating itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists have presented a micro-fiber adhesive as hair that self-cleans from dust during movement over a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesive.
Remedies: Never with fruit juice
Attention to pomelo juice, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, consumed primarily in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by increasing or decreasing according to the case, the efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices be packed that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society ongoing in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of pomelo juice, orange and apple is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, annuling the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Pomelo juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolithic, antihistaminic and neurological medicines.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in the case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
Not only the pomelo – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of the active ingredients inhibited by pomelo and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries generally come pointed to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the informative notes of the same.
That’s why you have to always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are assumed and if there’s something that’s not clear to us, don’t let us impress, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly,” the expert of the agency Ansa said.
The Economy Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at the University of Princeton and is a notorious New York Times publisher.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of Bush administration’s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the 2001 September 11 attack, in those days that Enron broke down, Krugman had forecasted in a editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more determinant than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but that is now revealed accurate.
“I’m surprised and slightly annoying how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a discloser with a "very aggressive, critical style against the excesses of Bush administration's liberalism."
Open Office, echo the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose back is monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelty: to the welcome screen and to the less thick magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Attention put also to multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as one that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic elaboration module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text elaborator.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator comes given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to that for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent at home or at work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hole for the dissemination in the houses, it is in business that Open Office the suite tries, tries the great bet, and can already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospectives could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding of Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, eat in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows to work on the date base; and lastly Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that it can exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is the fourth case of doping.
New positive case in the Tour of France: it’s the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the best rally of the escalator.
The news is published on the L’Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive runner to the Epo of third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of the Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in the last weeks at Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the counter-test confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place in the Tour and be angry against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the Epo of third generation is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium at the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding the remnard of the best escalator.
Immigrants: New York Times asks, is Italy racist?
Italy of immigrant country has just recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants” hostilely welcomed.
This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered the month before in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case evidences what the New York Times defines the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” are recorded but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support of the Northern League.”
As confirms the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also quoted the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Also the new legislation loved by the League pushes the barrier on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of the clandestines is quoted as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the Church to work together to fight racism."
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the rental syndicate, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the highly cost that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has completely deformed the market to a point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for residents.”
Except that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no limit of canon, under rental liable.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are required that, through the review of the taxation, the prices can be regulated.
Looking in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, serve approximately 450 euros; for a individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University(San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) you ask about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities(Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Economy is made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for an individual room in the Prenestina, Centocelle area and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one individual.
In the youngest cities the prices are lower in absolute deadlines, but it has a greater weight in the city’s economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the rental phenomenon to students and non-community is more frequent, a subsequent anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to the Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel historic rooms
Historic cinema rooms close favouring the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the big Italian urban centers and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory,"it's like a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared," Observe the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the great prize of the jury in Cannes, which told the poetry of a province cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that lost forever.
The figures given by the Annec, the main association of merchants, speak clear: in the last five years have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the majority are above all the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are as the first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 movies less, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, they are own of these three Italian regions that have recorded the greatest number of new meticone cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 be in Toscana than in Emilia-Romania.
“The Italian exercise has evolved irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, the chairman of the Annex, “it would be useful that new structures are built but the remaining of those already existing should be guaranteed, because when a city room is closed, not all of its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To maintain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with the closures, decided to repair with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and tutel the cinema mono sala be in the historic center than in the periphery.
Among the foreseeable standards there are tax facilitation intermediates in favour of the managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the area of limited traffic and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting on other measures.
It is true that in order to contrast the extra power of the meticons, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that for me was always important: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chispa that convinced me to perform the "New Cinema Paradise", which I already thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of the National Road already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I can’t see the cartels dirty by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
Lack between politics and 'ndrangheta', Mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"Gioia Tauro's mayor was available to uniform the municipality elections for those interested in the Piromalli coast."
The charges that the Magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the intendant and vice intendant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonym of the boss, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to indemnify 10 million euros.
“Despreciating any legal and moral norm, and of good sense,” the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
“It would have been allowed to the mafia family – writes the judges – to officially enter the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
Calabrés regional board president Agazio Loiero does not hide that “accords between organized bad life are a lot” in his region: “There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, heroes that keep clean.'
The detainees of this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the mafia family Piromalli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always for alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been solved from the commission of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendent, of the Udc at the time of dissolution, after the battle in May 2006, had been elected as the head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in question the Deputy Interior Minister who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3 road.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerge “the willingness to favour the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families.”
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated yacement that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now discovering it, the world’s great energy companies.
Olas, currents, melting are the new renewable sources on which big people look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from the sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, along with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the low oil price, in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of marine energy was apart, but now that the environmental cases and the new oil rise give the sector an impulse.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the sea waves.
This amount would be twice the amount produced today by nuclear power plants.
And there will also be the currents and marries.
The Giants Attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, who in 2005 signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it looked like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies the ones who have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying the technology on ocean energy – said a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossal to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new perforations.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the way of the energy that comes from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy there is no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts such as those Portuguese or the Scots are of small dimension and don’t seem to create great problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of goods connected between them.
The strength of the waves, which makes the bones move up and down, turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure makes a turbine rotate which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type on development routes, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, in turn, already produces energy for a shopping center and for a parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are thunderstorms, makes the turbine palettes turn, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the waves.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the development of electricity, deserves at this time the potential of the melting.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, mores are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It’s above all about the energy of the storms that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that approach the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and is expected a investment of $35 million for 2009.
