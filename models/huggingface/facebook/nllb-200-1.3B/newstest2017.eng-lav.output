The £2 a day drug that can reduce heart attack threat

Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences".

The Mayor of Cannes, the southern France seaside resort, has banned wearing burkini swimsuits, which almost completely cover the woman's body and resemble a wetsuit, on the beaches of the city, local officials announced on Thursday.
David Linard, Mayor of Cannes, has signed an order that "persons, who have no swimsuit honoring good customs and secularism, are prohibited to access beaches and swimming areas" as the basic principle of the Republic of France.

Porgy and Bess returns to the stage after 10 years' break in Liepāja
The opera "Porgy and Bess" was first performed in Latvia in 1973, as a production of the Latvian National Opera.


"We are extremely happy that, after a ten's break since Liepaja could enjoy this opera for the last time, the new wonderful concert version of George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" has returned to the recently opened Great Amber concert hall", head of the concert hall Great Amber Baiba Boze told us.

The exhibition will feature various items characterizing "Livi": a timeline with photos reflects the band's activities from its beginnings until 2010 when the band officially announced the end of its career.


The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.

The story of "Livi" began in 1972 when Juris Pavitols founded a band of popular music.
The band's first line-up participated in the "Liepajas dzintars" festival in 1972 and 1974 as well as performance review concerts around Latvia.
1976 was a decisive turning point when Juris Pavitols met Eriks Kigelis: the band found a base at the Metal Worker's Culture Hall and invited Ingrida Gutmane, Andris Kruzins and Janis Grodums to join.



"Tena na a lot to see: jeans, long hair and beards; these guys were different from the conventional stereotype of a crooner on stage", comments music journalist Klass Vavere about the band.

"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events", the report said.

From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.

"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces", Representative Adam B.

This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products", hurt the morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views".
n Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative".

The criticisms on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts' objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence. Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.

Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glaswegian was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favored New Zealand outfit.
UK claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a low sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired. And they repeated the trick after finishing a low sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.

Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.

AGL, who supplies the big aluminum smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.

"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue", it said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called "hedging contracts" which were due to take effect from November 2016.

"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17", the power company said."As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.

Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need", he said.

The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.

New York: Kampanye Donald Trump dico di atas tuduhan tidak melakukan apa-apa setelah diberitahu bahwa direktur operasi North Carolina nya menarik pistol ke arah seorang staf ketika mereka mengemudi di dalam sebuah Jeep pada bulan Februari.

Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realizing "this wasn't going to happen".
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap", Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Pistols don't have to fire to inflict damage", Bordini said in the complaint."Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage", Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furor when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordinis complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.

NASA: Venus was once habitable

The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-shocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.

The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.


"Kati pa simulasi GISS, a' Venera's slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time", explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is average climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today. The result is average climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.

The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.

                                                                                                                                               
At their peak rotation rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.


Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots  like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin slower than less massive stars. The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"Through the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars", said Rebull.

"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older", said Rebull."The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older", said Rebull.

Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
