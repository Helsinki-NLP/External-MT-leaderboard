The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports only the number of COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained from government sources such as the Ministries of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities of countries and WHO, which is updated daily at 8:00 am.
The data was used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare with what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day short growth of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also presented the accumulated numbers of cases documented in each country as of 08:00 am on 15 March 2020 as compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.

For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, accumulated cases of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then increased sharply around February 28, 2020 (complete ingredient).
This was driven mainly by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in the accumulated cases of COVID-19 increase (complete material).
Figure 2 compares the numbers of Italy with the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January15 March 2020.

Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is progressing at a comparative pace in all countries.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Early in March 2020, doctors in infected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Admission data for COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or an intensive care unit is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, these should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 survey of 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal in 100,000 beds showed a large gap between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
11 = 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people.
Given the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK, the Healthcare Capacity Engagement Modelling situation shows that there is a > 90% risk of impaired intensive care bed capacity and is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
As incidents have so far been reported in EU/EEA countries and some areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically provide a specific regional service to the population, it is advisable to obtain information on infected and intensive care beds in the statistical statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level for regional unit naming system.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for the ongoing community infection situation with SARS-CoV-2 and the need for healthcare and especially intensive care, as happened in the affected areas of Italy, to increase the number of COVID-19 cases.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a swift, pre-active and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from repression to mitigation, as if not implemented ahead of time, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and formulate their response accordingly.
Rapid Risk Assessment also provides a list of public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity when countries are likely to step up their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world and infected more than 80,000 people, which has caused a disaster for humanity.
SARS-CoV is similar to its counterpart virus, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and can cause the same symptoms through the same procedure.
COVID-19 is less severe and deaths than SARS, but is more contagious and affects men more than young people and women more than adults.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the topic of rapidly developing research.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, atology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, indicators of disease and prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help us understand and eliminate the terrifying disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were asked to stay indoors for weeks during the holiday and beyond due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly correlated with the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its related disease was renamed CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to more than 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which over 40,000 patients have been released and over 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""enemy number one of the people"" and probably more powerful than terrorism".
PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) has published over 200 articles on COVID-19 in less than two months since its first report on 7 January 2020, including viral, epidemiological, atology, diagnosis and treatment, which have ranked the virus separately from multiple patients.
The review seeks to summarize the progress of research in a new and fast developing field.

The current COVID-19 is the third recorded COVID outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, the origin of pneumonia was not known, and was first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
7 days later, the sequence of the CoV was released.
The first fatal incident in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.

The situation is rapidly escalating and the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric survey of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented the following updated data on the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has been found mainly in the age group of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 of those infected were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).

COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period of pathogens was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the coordinated R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected before 23 January 2020 rose rapidly, coinciding with the massive transportation period before the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed case mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the coordinated mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subclass of large and wrapped viruses containing a single formula of sensory RNA.

The wrapping key (S) glycoprotein for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively binds to its cellular consumer angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidial peptidase 4 (DPP4) and then the membrane is added.
Virus RNA is released into the genome cytoplasm; after making copies of the viral genome, the envelope forms a vecil or guttic with the genome RNA vein-containing with glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identification of more than 99.98% in 10 sequential samples collected from the Huan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the main site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher genetic similarity to SARS-CoV than MES-CoV.

The human ACE2 receptor was reported to be present in humans as well as SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind relatively more weakly to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection among patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 encodes by orf3b and can also make proteins encoded by orf8.

They found that the open and closed adaptive compound was combined as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for detection and transmission of CoV.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for pharmacological testing to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were reported to have originated in bats and spread to humans through cats and camels respectively.

Ji and others who introduced the snake as the carrier of the virus from bats to humans that is involved in the reconstitution of homologs to S proteins.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that the long-stemmed pangolin, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, is a potential intermediate in SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology of 99% of the CoV  found in SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin.
The 1% difference in the two genomes is still a big difference, however; therefore, the final results are still awaited for stronger evidence (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a dry environment outside the body for up to 48 hours and 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; other fat solvents other than ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, paracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine can effectively neutralize the virus.
The entire human race in general has a lack of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore is at risk of contracting the novel virus.

Generally, once a virus has entered a pathogen, it is first identified by the pathogenic immune system of the pathogen through pattern-marking receptors. These receptors include C-type lactine-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
In a variety of ways, the virus stimulates the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that restrict viral transmission and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
The N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to survive the immune response.
Soon, the applied immune response also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help immune cells.
However, CoV may inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell death.

The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days, based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
Research on 1,099 cases has shown that incubation period was on average 3 days and the range was 0 to 24 days.
A recent study showed that the incubation period of pathogenicity was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the population of 8,866 cases as described above.
Adjusting effective quarantine times based on the most accurate pathogen detection time is very important for health authorities to prevent transmission of the virus from infected but without symptoms to others.

In most cases, fever is the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, nausea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and vomiting.
A week after the onset of the disease some patients experienced dyspnia (dizziness) and/or hypoxia.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.

A demographic survey in late December 2019 found that 98% of the patients had fever, 76% had dry cough, 55% had dyspnea and 3% had diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
A class cluster and a cluster caused by infection from a symptomless person were reported in two recent studies.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnia (55%).
However, they needed 80% ventilation support, which is much higher than the COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS mortality than the COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%)
SARS patients showed that fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnia (40% -42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13) -25%) were the main symptoms and about 14% -20% of patients needed ventilation assistance.

Comparatively, SARS had a death rate of 8,096 confirmed cases, 10% as of November 2002.
MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
Previous study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 was higher than R0 of 6.47, whereas R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV are compared to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and R0.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a higher potential to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the other two.

When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely jeopardize gas exchange.
The abnormal action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant levels and increases surface tension, which decreases the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of lung weakness.
The worst type of test radiographic searches are often: in the most severe cases of the disease.
February 18, 2020 Pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed multi-nucleated sincyte cells in the lungs of the deceased, including pneumocyte ser disqualification, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the same in SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main measurement for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the extremely high false-negative rate, which can accelerate the pandemic, starting from February 13, 2020, clinical or diagnostic disclosures are being used for diagnosis in China (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR).

Pharmaceutical companies are competing to create antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and also probably attacks other organs that release ACE2 at lower doses such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory failure and dysfunction are the leading causes of death and death for patients.
As such, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and is life-saving, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, ventilation that does not require cutting, and mechanical ventilation that requires cutting, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with Extrakorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology, used in the treatment of fatal cardiac or respiratory disorders.

Cytocin disorder is a form of inflammatory response in the nervous system that occurs by the release of classes of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines secrete large numbers of free radicals through immune cells, which is a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Prevention response suppression is essential in treating cytokine disaster, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tosilizumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, has been used to treat cytokine disorder.
Other anticonvulsant treatments for cytokine disorder include correction of T cell-directed immune responses; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockage; JAK sedation; Blinatumomab (blinatumomab); inhibitor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Although steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, they can cause serious side effects, particularly avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the likelihood of erection.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

In fact, patients who recover often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood in terms of pathogens.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight bacteria and other foreign substances and they identify and directly mitigate individual molecules of pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.

Although, specific therapies have not yet been developed and prior verification and clarification are necessary to propose methods for widespread use.
In addition, in terms of therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
Antibodies, for example, can over-exciter the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially fatal toxicity.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are generally low, and plasma is in high demand for treating critically ill patients.

However, its effects depend largely on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most of the active ingredients are unknown or unclear, as such ingredients or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Today, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those returning from the critical stage.
Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
TCM was used in 87% of patients in many states of China with the highest recovery rates, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where TCM was used in just roughly 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).

On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing combined treatment of WM and TCM with Western medicine (WM) treatment.
They found that the time needed for body temperature to return to normal, for symptoms to disappear and for hospitalization was significantly less in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most interestingly, the symbolic decline rate (light to severe) was significantly lower for WM+TCM groups alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower for WM+TCM groups alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Though the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for more controlled testing at larger scale and more centers.
It would also be interesting to identify the workflow and, if possible, clarify the effective components or combinations of TCM treatment.
Most of the patients suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 experience a fear of highly contagious and even life-threatening illness, and quarantined people also experience isolation, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and adverse treatment effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and stress.
In the early stages of SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor exhaustion, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt about the impact of infection, quarantine and the contamination of their families and friends.
So, COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have come into contact with them, as well as the general public who need mental health care, should be provided.
Mental health teams from multiple branches of medicine, clear communication on the outbreak and treatment plans of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other should be included.
Vaccines are essential to prevent the chain of infection from animal reservoirs and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and often complement antiviral treatments in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
S protein-based vaccines have been developed to produce long-term and strong antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create immune immunity.

Conversely, the spread of MERS and the outbreak of MERS continues in the Middle East and spreads to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the affected region.
Vaccination procedures for MERS have been developed using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Preparing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing pandemic.

Therefore, it is essential for healthcare agencies to develop a predictive model of the disease to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the diagnostic studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the rate of disease indicators in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the outcome of SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was mainly diagnosed in the 30-65 age group, including 47.7% of those over 50 in the above 8,866 case study.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have other conditions and complications at the same time and were significantly older than others (66 years of age vs. 51 years of age) which indicates age as an indicator of disease progression for the outcome of COVID-19 patient.
Gender: Male SARS-CoV-2 infections are higher than female (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Existence and complexity of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart attack and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.

Abnormal data from the laboratory: Blood C-reactive protein (CRP) levels reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to tissue and have been suggested as an indicator of the rate of disease for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The CRP level also suggested a correlation between COVID-19 severity and prediction.

These emitted by multiple organs, especially the heart and liver, and released during cell damage.

Key Diagnostic Symptoms: For the prediction of COVID-19 complications and consequences, along with other problems, breast radiography and periodic progression of diagnostic symptoms should be considered.
Steroid use: As described above, to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunct therapies for infectious diseases.
As high dosages of corticosteroids were widely used among severe SARS patients, many of the progenitors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, including chronic disability and low quality of life.

Paul Hunter and others speculated that COVID-19, which is proving to be more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat lalarese in patients recovering and discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus will have a similar cyclical phase to influenza.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, even through coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with contaminants contaminated by the virus.
The virus was found in the mouth, which highlights the new potential for mouth-to-mouth infection.
Recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were likely caused by nasocomal (hospital-derived) infections, including 17 other pre-existing patients and 40 healthcare providers.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Mask may be used as a first step in protecting against infection; surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series #1860) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face mask prevents small droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or getting stuck on the surface of the object, from where they could spread to others.
N95 (Series #1860s) masks can only protect against small viral respiratory receptions of 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virus is able to enter completely; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is the same as that of SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
As particles can even enter through five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come into direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series#1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
Healthcare providers should wear masks and appropriate isolation gowns to reduce exposure to the virus.
Virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Healthcare providers should also wear transparent face coverings or eyeglasses when patients are working.
In the case of public in affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and to limit exposure to potentially infected persons.

Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a new virus, China should have taken high-precaution based on a deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV, according to a report dated 7 January 2020.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

(ii) to be more sensitive and responsive to unsolicited information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) to be more controllable in order to contain potential epidemics in the early stages rather than trying to console the public; and (4) to issue frequently specific and effective practices aimed at increasing public awareness of disease outbreaks and periodically testing and improving community response methods.
COVID-19 was first identified in late December 2019 as a result of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling of SARS returning as the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and is also similar to the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS.

COVID-19 affects men more than young people and women more than older people and has a higher severity and mortality rate than young people.
SARS death rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even without symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so in a severe illness, making it much more difficult to contain COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.

Covid-19 research has progressed so rapidly that several key issues remain to be addressed:
SARS-CoV-2 is from where?
Although 96% of the genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-CoVs has been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
Which animal was the primary carrier, such as the middling species, to transmit the virus from bats to humans?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent metabolic changes?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Without a clear answer, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus genetically propagate during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, death like SARS, or a recurrence like the flu?

Animal sources of human coronaviruses
Transformation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its nutrients, including humanity, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness like the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has reversed the currency to reveal how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back to the top of the discussion and surprised us with higher transmission and lower pathogenicity than our sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal disease and understanding the zoonotic source of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Aadhaar is also known to provide shelter for some HCoVs.
The human immunity is directly influenced by animal nutrition.
Investigating the exchange of CoV hosts between animals can also provide important insights into human transmission of CoV.
In this review, we provide a summary of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their animal sources and interconnected infections.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome reconnection.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic was discussed.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The coronavirus (CoV-group) belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of coated, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"The viruses that shelter the largest genome of 26 to 32 kB of RNA viruses were designated as ""CoV"" due to the crown-like organ structure under the electron microscope".
Structurally, the CoVs have an integral genome that belongs to the same organization.
The genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) in about two-thirds of the genome, which are converted (translated) into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
Polyproteins are processed to produce 16 more non-structural proteins, which are named nsp1~16.
ORFs for structural proteins in the rest of the genome include keylock (S), wrapping (E), membrane (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV, and Delta-CoV), of which the Beta-CoV genera contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four genera (A, B, C, and D).
Ethnological evidence shows that bats and mice act as the gene source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over the course of thousands of years, the CoVs have steadily overcome interspecies barriers and emerged as some of the major human pathogens.

HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are the alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly detected SARS-CoV-2 cause highly pathogenic, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory distress infections in a relatively high number of patients with a higher chance of being released outside the lungs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was collected from the nasal discharge of common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, until the SARS outbreak, the idea was widely accepted that HCoVs were generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating events in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and causing roughly 10% of all deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak continues to plague the Arabian Peninsula and spread to the rest of the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the effective agent of the current coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 infections as of March 3, 2020.
Alarm clock rings and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs each have animal origins in bats, mice or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary source of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic yet show great genetic diversity.
COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The HCoV-group's animal origin tracing provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving forces and the reasons for species-to-species (species jumping) restrictions.
The new virus will be used to detect and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the wild.
In this review, we present a summary of the animal sources, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of the HCoVs.
In particular, we want to raise public awareness of the general context and discuss that the HCoV-type pathogenic viruses are usually pathogenic among their natural hosts but become pathogenic once they enter the body of the new host.
We also review the evolutionary trends of HCoV where infectiousness often decreases with increased infectiousness.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
The animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.

Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
HCoV-229E infects showed common cold symptoms including headache, dizziness, nausea and sore throat, and fever and cough in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from repeated growth of the virus in the brains of organ cultures and subsequently dairy mice.
HCoV-OC43 infection has clinical characteristics similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be characteristically distinguished from infection by other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both globally spread and are mainly infected in the winter climate during the subtropical season.

A study of human volunteers found that healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only some patients with immunodeficiency disabilities experienced severe low-respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first documented HCoV-related epidemic in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS was detected in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
SARS pandemic has resulted in 8,096 cases reported across multiple countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and with the onset on the 10th day of illness, could increase the viral load to about two additional cases.
In patients with SARS-CoV, muscle aches, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold symptoms are primarily associated with shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress.
Lymphophonia, liver dysfunction testing and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
SARS patients also experienced dispersed alveolar damage, proliferation of subcutaneous cells and growth of macrophages.

In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, can be infected in severe cases, usually with cytokine disasters that can be especially fatal in patients with immune system impairment.

Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was primarily common in young children, elderly and patients with respiratory illnesses who had low immunity.
Coronary artery disease, eyelids, fever and bronchiolitis are common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.

HCoV-NL63 is related to the abstractive laryngitis, also known as the croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-associated pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute diarrheal disease.
HCoV-HKU1 is a global pathogen of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which causes mild respiratory disease.
All four group-derived HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as the rare case of the highly harmful subtype of HCoV-NL63 which has recently been reported to cause severe low-respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to functionally transmit and maintain themselves in humans, they become relatively less harmful or contagious.
MERS-CoV was first collected in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had been diagnosed with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases from outside have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary outbreaks in close contact.

Over 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach diseases such as diarrhea and dizziness.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratories have confirmed a mortality rate of over 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses for the human body.
In mid-to-late December 2019, classes of pneumonia patients were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as having been traditionally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern and has designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, with a total mortality rate of 3.4%, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.

Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches of the racially-occurring tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is relatively less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have no symptoms and may play a role in its rapid spread worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoVs have been compared and compared to high interest similarities and differences.
First, the time of onset of the pathogen and the course of HCoV are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is mediated between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63), which are publicly transmitted.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the other hand, exhibits characteristics that are typically seen with non-specific, mild or even symptomless presentations during community acquired HCoV-type infections.

Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection group shows interesting characteristic patterns of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the group-dominated HCoV.

None of the above, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission will influence the outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four sub-group-derived HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to all humans.

In other words, both may be descendants of the ancient HCoV epidemic.
The HCoVs that cause serious disease in humans and those that develop serious HCoVs have been killed.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate in humans to build up adaptive strains that fight against the causes of host restriction.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.

Conversely, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and cannot sustain human transmission.
need to be maintained and propagated in their zoonotic bases and possibly seek opportunities to propagate to sustainable human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying nutrients.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.

An animal acts as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it provides shelter to closely related ancestors by sharing higher homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The pathogenic virus is usually well adapted to the host's body and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, an Aadhaar shelter provides HCoVs with continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its pathogenic virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or just around introduction to humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and can act as an amplifier host in temporarily replicating the virus and then expanding the level of human infection by transmitting it to the human body.
HCoVs can cause transmission delay if they cannot continue transmission between hosts.
HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and trigger long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the intermediate material becomes the natural base material.
The epidemiological data traditionally revealed that the SARS indicator had a history of contact with the animals of prey.
Subsequent Seroprevalence investigations have indicated that there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG among animal traders than among the general population.
A raccoon dog was first identified in the Gandagookul (Paguema larvae) and livestock markets for carrying a virus similar to SARS-CoV that was almost identical to SARS-CoV.

All of these are considered to be one-way carriers of SARS-CoV.
Following research into the natural animal carrier of SARS-CoV  has revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related rhinolophase bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese equine bat.
The bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The research has created a new idea that bats provide shelter for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoV strains (SL-CoV) have been identified from bats, but none can be collected as live viruses except for a designated WIV1.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a subscriber of SARS-CoV
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Interestingly, the serums of patients with SARS who were recovering were able to disable WIV1.
WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which share 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high degree of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not an immediate parental virus and bats are not an immediate host of SARS-CoV.
Phylegenetic analyses classify MERS-CoV into the same class as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, Diptydeyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
RNA-based MERS-CoV RNA polymerization sequences are phylogenetically close to replicas of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.

MERS-CoV and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25, share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.

The study found that one-legged camels were seropositive to MERS-CoV specific antibodies, similar to camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
The MERS-CoV, a virus-like organism found in humans, was collected from the nose swab of a camel with a tail, which further suggests that camels serve as the true base carrier for MERS-CoV.

The bat CoV RaTG13 collected from the Rhinofosus affinis bat has a 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine parental relationships.
This means that if almost identical bat CoVs are not detected in the future, bats may not be a direct carrier of SARS-CoV-2.

Several recent studies based on metgenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as bonruis (Manis Javanika) may also carry SARS-CoV-2 related genetic beta-CoVs.
The novel is a replica of the 85-92% of the Bonroe CoV genomes in the nucleotide sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2.

They cluster in two sub-types of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, in racially related trees, one of which shares a similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) identifying a 97.4% amino acid sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although sequence homology is higher in genome-wide degrees.
Previous study on ill Bonrouy also reported detection of a continuous sequence of viruses from lung samples, which have been shown to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to create partial genome sequences with approximately 86.3% of full-length viral genomes.

However, due to sequence differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV-group, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2.

The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and RBDs in Botswana, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-groups, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-based sequence homology.
It is highly unlikely that the high similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-centered evolution.
An anti-proposal in favour of a reconciliation between SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13, a third wildlife species.
As a driving force in evolution, the reconnection between the beta-CoV-groups is widespread.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylegenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bat CoVs, although the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
The HCoV-NL63 is a bat CoV, known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), identified in North American tricolor bats.
HCoV-229E was genetically related to another batch of CoV, known as Hippocydrosis/Ghanacoma /19/2008, although camellide has also been suspected as an intermediate.
For clarity, the known animal sources of HCoVs are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnological analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission events in the history of CoV-groups.
around 1890 when HCoV-OC43 passed through the species and infected humans from domestic animals, a respiratory epidemic occurred.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively unclear.
Alpha-CoVs have been found in bats that are closely related to HCoV-229E.

A number of evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in shared ecological environments, it can be from the interaction of bats with humans but not with alpacas.

Secondly, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic among alpha-CoV-group bats, while alpaca causes respiratory disease outbreaks among alpha-CoV-infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wildlife.

MERS-CoV is a prime example of how a bat spreads a strain of infection from bats to bats and a strain of infection from bats to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV from bats is known from early detection and is further confirmed by subsequent studies.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Longevity, calmly colonized, close social exchange and strong ability to fly are the ideal conditions for bats to be a 'virus spreader'.
MERS-CoV was first discovered in a camel decades ago.
It fits well with these camels which have gone from an intermediate host to a stable and natural-based host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low transmission rate among these animals.
The spread of MERS-CoV among humans is an accident and humans remain the last refuge of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of the camel in MERS-CoV , the role of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 infection is different.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They may be the last refuge for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs similar to the Gandagoculi in the case of SARS-CoV.
The possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from interspecies to humans may be included or discarded in future studies.
First, bats can be the primary host for a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Secondly, the Bonrouis may be among the intermediate amplifier hosts where a SARS-CoV-2 related virus was newly introduced.

Antibodies have been confirmed in a study of domestic and wildlife.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the reconstitution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in third species that have interactions with both bats and pangolin.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
In addition to the various animal shelters, three main factors of viral side are also important in helping CoVs overcome interspecies barriers.
First, they have relatively high rate of RNA transcription.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated transmission rate of the CoV-set can be considered to be ""medium"" to ""high"" depending on the decimal amount of novel nutrient CoV adaptation, and the average replacement rate would be ~10-4 replacements per year at 2 sites per year".
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, which elimination results in excessive variability and weakness or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerization of the nucleotide analogue remdesivis are known to form CoV replicas.
Remdesvir is one of the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 ingredients tested in diagnostic trials.
Nevertheless, the transmission rates of CoV-groups are about one million times higher than their hosts.

Theoretically, the genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 is highly unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals ineffective quickly.
Secondly, large RNAs of CoV use extra flexibility in genome transcription for genome transcription and reconnection, which increases the probability of evolution including interconnection, which is conducive to the emergence of CoV-clusters when conditions become favorable.
It is supported by a large number of unique encoded open reading frames and protein functions at the 3′ edge of the genome.
"Third, CoV-compounds change templates when they replicate RNA randomly and often through a unique ""copy-like"" process".
The host that acts as a mixing pot often has strand switching during CoV RNA replication.
High homogeneous full-length and subgenome RNAs can reconnect to form new CoV-clusters.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural reconciliation has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal CoV-clusters such as Bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interactions of viruses-propagators in relation to infection
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral exchange with host receptors is another key factor influencing interspecies infection.
Among these, the reincarnation of SARS-CoV is taken as a prime example, which also showed evidence of positive selection when interspecies infections occurred.
Based on comparative analysis of the collection of human and odorless SARS-CoV-CoV, it is thought that SARS-CoV can adapt rapidly to mutations of RBD, especially S proteins, among different hosts.
RBD normally interacts with a cellular receptor on an S protein of a CoV and is highly selective by response to host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is composed of 318th to 510th amino acids in the S1 fragment that bind to human ACE2 as well as its coryceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, seabirds, mice and raccoon dogs, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to differ from the odorless viral isolates in humans and RBD, and 4 of them are located in the client-centered design for interaction with ACE2 clients.
The coveted SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the affinity of spike protein exchange with the ACE2 receptor in humans.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
30% difference between the S1 unit of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggests that the tendency of its S protein to bind to human ACE2 may vary.
Indeed, a Crio-EM study indicates a tendency for bonds to be 10 to 20 times higher than the ones that exist between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Worryingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but with a separate subset of S.
There are many other HCoVs, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated silica acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be a factor in the successful adaptation of this group of CoVs to humans after they have been transmitted from their animal host to the intraspecies.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcomes of interspecies transmission of HCoV-groups are also driven by factors of dependence and restriction on other hosts.
The breakdown of these host proteins between humans and HCoV-groups of natural hosts such as bats, one-horned oats and mice can prevent interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host dependence factors for a successful interspecies infection and destroy the host restriction factors.
In this case, the molecular determinants of this important area of virus-associated exchange have yet to be identified and characterized.
Neutral genomic-expansion screening of host dependence and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The rise of the novel HCoV: Back to where it started
Variation of bat CoVs provides significant opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, the bat acts as the gene pool of the CoV-type HCoV-type.
In addition, rapid transmutation and genetic reconnection drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the ability to radically modify acquired or lost viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV adjunct proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in human adaptation because SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but have been found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
The removal of a 29-nucleotide of the SARS-CoV-CoV-group was found in strains collected at the beginning of the human pandemic.

In addition, there is a history of possible reconciliation of SARS-CoV with the alpha- and gamma-CoV-groups, where large numbers of small reconciliation regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerization.
The recombination positions were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic went through a series of strain-reconnections, which occurred in a Saudi Arabian camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of reassortment have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs reassort with other animal CoVs in genes that are not their constituent.

The HCoV-229E prototype is a complete length ORF4 loss due to the removal of the bi-nucleotide.
Although intact ORF4 HCoV-229E can be seen in bats and camel viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide placed inside, with the result being seen in frame shifts.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the underlying selection pressures.
When bats were infected with CoV, they were symptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CoV-group and bats.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, errors in activation of the response to inflammation in bats effectively reduce pathology driven by the CoV-group.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats has been suppressed due to low levels of release of inhibitory natural killer cell receptors NKG2/CD94 and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
In addition, suppressing the replication of high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of bats and influencing the pre-filling by exoribonucleases can both do this, thus providing the selection pressure necessary to produce strains of the virus when in contact with a new host.
The more pathogenic strains of CoV can also be developed through re-synthesis which leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
The possibility of three new HCoVs emerging in the last two decades is not accidental.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their host species such as bats and camels.
They grow strong without strong resistance from the host.
Why there are no symptoms and what causes serious human infections.
Symptoms are mainly due to over-activation of the immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
Conversely, in the case of symptomless carriers, the immune response is differentiated from the CoV replicas.
The same tactic of disconnecting immune responses may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Typ I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
In this case, NLRP3 may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 with MCC950.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common causes that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Although the Gandagoculi and other animals found in the market have been reported to have sheltered viruses similar to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate shelters for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.

Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
COVID-19 has once again been a topic of discussion due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of the CoV cluster in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal sources and the animal basis of the HCoV cluster in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a fungal source and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and bats in the market, killing bats in the wet market could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the same vein, in the context of the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin beta-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal transmission.

Special, the bat CoVs with animal potential are very diverse.
There is a high potential for these zoonotic CoVs to propagate and reconnect, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or fatal to humans in the future.

Although bats have many characteristics that allow them to spread the virus, the chance of humans being exposed to bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware of their need to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the CoVs and their natural host ecosystems, which will prove effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne disease in humans is to stay away from the environmental niche of the natural basis of animal viruses.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 parental virus to bats, it is important to see under what circumstances bats and bats can share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human infection, then how humans are exposed to bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate nutrient, it must clarify how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and test infections should be carried out.

According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm suspected cases, for a detailed analysis, two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical characteristics must be present, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three clinical symptoms must be filled in.
Epidemiological history: (1) history of residents of or traveling to Wuhan City and its surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive on a nucleic acid test); (3) history of exposure to patients with fever or positive symptoms in Wuhan City or surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of exposure to small cases of COVID-19 (such as exposure to office, school, classroom, etc.) within 2 weeks and/or 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white blood cell counts at the initial leakage stage show normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte counts.
In order to diagnose confirmed cases based on suspected cases, there should be any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive on a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic real-time PCR test; (2) high homogeneity or similarity to a known novel coronavirus in full gene sequencing of the virus; (3) positive on a serum test for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; or positive on a SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies to change from negative to positive, and ≥4 times greater than the severe stage of growth in the retina and typhus.
We found that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions included real-time PCR testing and blood samples for the respiratory nucleic acid diagnostic.
Diagnostic pathogenesis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
The changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find a suitable nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, including blood samples from the respiratory tract, which increases the availability of various samples and which helps bring certain antibody positive results to a certain standard.

Therefore, Zhou and his colleagues should update the flow list, as they classify those without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The score system needs to be verified in subsequent clinical practices and studies.
Conclusion
To identify suspected cases and confirmed cases, we recommend identifying them and following the latest guidelines in your country.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to help.

Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the sale of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The changes follow the previous transaction limitations of four packs that Woolworths and Coles launched on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"On March 8, Coles announced that the four-pack ban had been introduced in various places, but that ""many stores still sell everything within an hour of supply"", a demand they described as ""incredible"" and in a Facebook post on ALDI on Tuesday they described it as ""unexpected"".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales rose sharply last week.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
To further reduce the deficit, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the repayment rate, Woolworths orders extra stock, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on delivery by truck make the issue more difficult, said Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association.
As suppliers try to meet demand, he expects production costs to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after leaving stock early, some stores will not be able to hold special sales on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, retail expert Dr Gary Mortimer from Queensland University of Technology said stores fill their inventories every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy material which makes it very small in quantity and when all is sold the huge shelves are empty and makes the feeling of shortage even stronger.
"Coles and Woolworths feel that if they have a lot of stuff, and they [buy] stuff like toilet rolls and sanitisers, and they have enough, then maybe that fear will be reduced", said Russell Zimmerman.
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
News.com.au reports that Kimberly-Clark, who builds Clinix toilet tissue and solaris paper that makes the equipment, insisted they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at the Melbourne auction, some of which were due to the fact that buyers were given a long working weekend.
In this Thursday edition of the daily NT News in Darwin, an eight-page annex is given for cutting into pieces and used as toilet paper.

Russell Zimmerman also said that there was a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, hand washes and flour.
Similarly, every Sunday evening outside Australia, online British supermarket in Okadawo limits sales of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.

Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
"Although the term ""epidemic"" does not refer to how dangerous specific cases are but rather to how widespread any disease has become, the World Health Organization has pointed out the need for governments to act:"
"All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic".
"WHO Secretary General Adhanum Gebreysas said that if states can identify,"" they can test, treat, isolate, identify and unify".
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming levels of disease transmission and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity"."
"According to Dr. Tom Freuden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is 'unprecedented'".
In a February CNN comment, he said, ""No other respiratory virus has been traced since its inception except for the influenza virus, which has been continuously spreading around the world"."
"We have never seen a coronavirus pandemic before", says Gabrades, who shares the same view.
"And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time"."
The new status of global pandemic follows WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""In short, things are going to get worse"".
Associated Press reported on Thursday that there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 infections worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.

Primal care is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering your face when coughing, keeping distance from other people, and monitoring and isolating yourself for people who suspect infection.
Global authorities have responded by closing travel controls, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk controls and facilities.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, the cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and increased supply shortages due to fear of shopping.
Schools and universities are closed nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world's total student population.

A survey published on 16 March found that as of 23 January, approximately 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of the recorded cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official accounting of infections.
The initial estimate of the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
The number of cases of a disease is 5.7

COVID-19 can cause a very high death toll, as it may not include people who die without testing - such as at home, nursing home, etc.
Some partial data from Italy shows that the number of overdose deaths during the pandemic has increased to 4-5 times the official COVID death rate.
"We know that [the number of deaths reported] is less speculative than the actual number", a spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, a statement made by reports that are not based on low-count data in the United States. Such underestimates occur frequently in global pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.

As of March 13, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica.
The number varies by region, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of healthcare, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, worldwide death-case ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the mortality-to-case ratio has dropped from 17.3% (of those who had symptoms between January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (of those who had the first symptoms since February 1, 2020). Other preventive measures fall under - case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and infection-to-infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or unspecified) who have died from a disease.
The statistics are not limited to any time period and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that overall mortality from the infection is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculation of the upper end of this range is consistent with a statistical study of the first allopathic test of COVID-19 in Germany and the analysis of the test's impact on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
Maximum and final timeframe of outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
McKees Bonnie of Penn State University said, ""As infectious outbreaks go from untested, they usually dominate and then they begin to decay when the disease no longer has a host".


"Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said on 17 March that SARS-CoV-2 ""will likely continue to spread for a year or two"."
"According to a study led by Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more) " physical distancing and other measures must be maintained".
William Scheffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's pretty unlikely that the coronavirus, as it spreads so quickly, will disappear completely and it could become a seasonal disease, coming back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the animal's immunity and range of transmission.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected individuals may be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Relatively uncommon symptoms include: constipation, cough, loss of breathing ability, shortness of breath, joint pain, swelling of the throat, headache, body cold, vomiting, coffee cough, hypertension, or cyanosis. WHO states that about 1 in 6 people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden confusion, waking and blue faces or lips as emergency symptoms; it is recommended that immediate medical attention be sought if these symptoms are present.

Chinese estimates of symptomatic ratios range from a few to 44%.
The range of the general incubation stage (period during which infection and symptoms begin) is from one day to 14 days; the incubation period is five days.

The virus can be detected temporarily depending on symptoms, but ultimately confirms the reverse transmission polymerization chain response (rRT-PCR) or city imaging of infected lalaras.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and many of its imaging features coincide with other processes of pneumonia and disease.
"The American College of Radiology recommended in March 2020 that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis""".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breathing or blood samples.

None of these have been proven to be valid enough to be approved for long-range use as of 6 April 2020.
The United States of America has approved cerological testing by the Chelsex to be used only in approved clinics in emergency situations.
The characteristic features of taking images on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include opaque peripheral ground glass and absence of plural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images from confirmed case studies.

The aim is to introduce other means of control and vaccination in addition to identifying and isolating infected people to prevent the spread of the disease among the remaining populations.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts go to the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken to slow the spread somewhat and reduce its impact on healthcare systems and society.
Containment (containment) and mitigation (neutralization) can be a mixed standard.
Consistency in suppression is needed to reverse the epidemic cycle to less than 1 in the initial reproductive numbers.Consistency in the epidemic is part of the epidemic outbreak management process known as the epidemic curve alignment.

South Korea has launched mass testing and local quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the manufacture of face masks and increased the penalty for medical supply fraud.The efforts of Great Britain and the United States prove that mitigation (slow but not prevented from spreading the pandemic) and repression (increased resistance to the pandemic) are a major challenge.
Although the most desirable eradication policies can reduce the maximum healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, health systems are still flooding as a result of millions of deaths.
Crime may be the preferred method, but it is necessary to maintain it as long as the virus continues to spread to the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), as measures are relaxed otherwise the virus infection will return quickly.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic cause social and economic damage.
️No specific antiviral medicines have been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing medicines.
Over-the-counter cold medication, fluid intake and rest can alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy, intravenous (via vein) fluid and breathing assistance may be needed.

Antibody detection (cerology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had very few or no symptoms to report.
The results of this test can be used to determine an accurate mortality rate and group immunity in the population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the outbreak of the virus among its population.

In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material may be taken from the deepest of the respiratory tract by suction catheters, or the excretion (spoon) with coughing can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at Charité, Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical phase PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It detects the common ""E"" gene and the RdRp gene that characterizes SARS-CoV-2 in all beta coronaviruses. BGI Group in China was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Medical Products Administration.
Unresolved results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests of older versions of the test kits and resulted in a test barrier at CDC in Atlanta; resulting in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US commercial labs began testing in early March 2020.

On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received EUA from the FDA for a similar test, which took about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, the method can produce positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.

"A literature review of March 2020 concluded that ""the importance of chest radiographs in the early stages is very low in diagnosis, but it may be present in data from CT [computed tomography] even before symptoms begin""".
CT features include a bi-lateral, multi-lober ground-glass optical efficiency with an edge, unobtrusive and backward distribution.
The disease develops with subplural dominance, madness and consolidation.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the current outbreak, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and that many of its imaging features are consistent with other processes of pneumonia and disease.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 screening or diagnosis"". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening".

The tests can be used to detect infection in humans, to determine immunity and to monitor the population from 7 days after the onset of symptoms.
High-performance automated systems in many essential laboratories will be able to perform on this axis, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single sample of endogenous blood is commonly used for CLT, although sequential samples may also be used to track immune response.

"Hong Kong has developed a scheme whereby the suspicious patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, return it and get the test results shortly afterwards. British NHS has announced that they are launching a scheme on a trial basis to test for suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient to other people when the patient is in a hospital, or eliminates the need to disinfect it when an ambulance is used.
Drive-through centres have enabled South Korea to conduct the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country.

This led some researchers to explore the sampling preparation protocol where the samples were heated to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE is now testing more populations for the coronavirus than any other country and is on track to increase testing levels to reach the majority of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-through capabilities and a population-scale mass-production laboratory purchase from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".

The German system was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed trials available in the U.S. Early in the outbreak, problems arose between China and the United States with the reliability of test kits, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits for meeting demand and recommendations to be tested by health experts.
Conversely, experts say that the large number of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has developed the ability to test in private sector labs for several years.
16 March, WHO called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to widespread infection of the virus has created a backlog of millions of testing jobs in private US labs, and pressures on supply of soaps and chemical disruptors.
China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits in March 2020.
"The test kits prepared by the CDC in the United States were ""erroreous""; the administration then removed the regulatory barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be false".

"Prime Minister Matovič proposed dumping them in the Danube River. Ates Kara, Turkish Health Ministry, said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a ""high rate of defects"" and they had not ""used them"".
Quarantine of those who tested positive and subsequent contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Voe, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two phases of testing on a total population of 3,400 people over a period of about ten days.
Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all identified people were quarantined.
Controlled transportation in the commune has completely eliminated new infections.

Statistical studies have shown that countries that have more tests than deaths have much lower death rates, because these countries may have been able to identify patients who have mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to test and have limited experience in national laboratories with COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for testing to confirm COVID-19.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.

Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of cleaning a person's hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microbial organisms, or other unwanted substances.
"Regular handwashing with soap at specific ""critical moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the vagus".
People can also develop respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., the salivary gland).
The five important moments of the day when washing hands with soap are: before and after urination, after cleaning or changing the nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating and before cooking or after handing out raw meat, fish, or poultry.

Medical hand hygiene refers to the healthier practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep the hands clean of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and of harmful or disease-causing chemicals.

A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to dizziness, a condition known as hand acne or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Prolonged hand washing is also a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five most important times of the day when hand washing is important to reduce the infection of the mouth and mouth are: after using the bathroom (soping, stooling), after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or putting hands on raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent infection include before and after cutting or wounding; diarrhea, coughing, or nostril; after touching animal waste or moving animals; and after touching garbage.

Adding soap or detergent to water increases the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solubility and increase solubility.
Water only is ineffective skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are organic soil constituents, are not easily soluble in water.

In addition to surfactants and skin-protective ingredients, sophisticated preparations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and additional skin conditioners (alovera, vitamins, methyl, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common ingredients such as triclona-added antibacterial substrates are effective in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hand.
Hot water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).

In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol rubs (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Isopropyl is mostly made from alcohol or ethanol, prepared by combining gel carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) or moisturizer with a solid material such as glycerin in liquid or foam to reduce the usability and drying effect of alcohol.
Adding the mixture of hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol which is effective at killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multivitamin resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol Rubber Sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equal to 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application in the hand and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria after 1 minute of application in the hand.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus (or norvaque) type of virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.

The increasing use of these ingredients depends on their ease of use and rapid destruction of the microbial organism; although they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
If the formula does not contain emulsifiers and/or skin moisturizers, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softening ingredients in clinical trials caused significantly less stress and dryness on the skin than soaps or disinfectant detergents.
Alcohol hand rubs rarely have allergic skin conditions, contact pathogenic disorders or hypersensitivity to alcohol or other substances.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower incidence of initiating painful contact dermatitis was a cause of attraction.

WHO recommends soap or sand as a substitute for soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission include:
Wash your hands in hot or cold running water.
Water is recommended because permanent basins can be polluted, but water temperature does not appear to make any difference.

"In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be made for hand washing facilities, for example pouring water from hanging jarries or suitable perforated lawns and/or using sawdust if necessary. Under limited water supply conditions (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water conservation treatments and other low-cost options such as ""TP-tap""".
Tippi-tap is a simple technique in which a joint suspended by rope and a leg-driven liver and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hand.
Drying hands well is an essential part of the hand sanitization process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of public bathroom drying.
Research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than many electric hand dryers found in the bathroom.
A study was produced by the Paper Towel Industry European Tissue Symposium in 2008 and conducted by the University of Westminster in London to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the fingers and 254% on the palms of the hands.
Drying with jet-air dryer increases the total number of bacteria in the fingers by 42% and the palms by 15%.
After hand washing, hand drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria in the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and the palms by 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to prove whether there was a possibility of contamination (crush-contamination) from other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying.
Jet-air dryer, which exudes air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing out germs from the hands and units and eliminating potential contamination of bathroom users and bathroom environment up to 2 m.

In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne illness and health care-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from this type of infectious disease.
"For example, in Germany posters with ""right hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets and near the hand washing sinks of office buildings and airport toilets".
"The phrase "to wash one's hands" means to expose one's desire to take responsibility for the matter or to be a partner in the wrong".
Its origin is from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate refused to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a language expression due to its more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an attempt to clear the fanciful stains by revealing her guilt over the crimes she has committed and the incitement to crime that has driven her husband to commit.

Control of workplace risk for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health practices to control risk to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work to be done, a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of illness in the public community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be at risk of COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues, with general prevention measures recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, breathing manners, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Mid-risk jobs include those jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but where frequent or close contact with people who may have been infected in the workplace due to an ongoing disease spread among the public or international travel is required.
Included are those with public connections, such as schools, high-density work environments, and some overcrowded retail.
In addition to the initial infection prevention measures, the disaster control system for this group includes ventilation, sniff guards and personal protective equipment available when facing COVID-19 infected persons using advanced capacity air filters.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and people working on the road to be at high risk of being exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections.
The appropriate risk controls for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure air circulation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for job tasks.
COVID-19 in the workplace can have many effects.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, to care for others, or for fear of possible exposure.
The way in which goods are in demand and the way in which they are purchased (such as shopping in a busy time or through delivery or drive-through services), both can change the nature of the business.
Finally, shipments from geographic areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
Planes address various workplace and workplace-related risk levels, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and personal risk factors for employees such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outlined the necessary controls to address these risks and plans to be prepared for the situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for communicable diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing infections among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse impacts on other organizations in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses received.
Risk management multi-level framework is a framework that is widely used to control occupational safety and health performance.

Administrative controls are changes in work-related policies or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control but may help prevent some exposure.
Select all PPE types based on employee risk, such as fit as appropriate (such as respirators), wear consistently and appropriately, regularly inspect, maintain and replace, and properly open, clean and store or cancel to avoid pollution.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States states states that jobs with a low risk of exposure are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home when ill, providing breathing habits with face coverings during nausea and cough, providing tissue and garbage disposal, being prepared for telecommunications or staggered shift when necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and materials, and maintaining a regular schedule of clean and disinfecting work environments.

OSHA defines jobs with a moderate exposure risk as those with no known or suspected COVID-19 presence, but who require frequent or close exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within six feet (1.8 m) of people who may have been infected by an ongoing disease in the business environment or who have recently travelled internationally to a place where COVID-19 has spread widely.
Workers with public contact, such as in schools, in high-density work environments, and in some crowded shops. Administrative controls for high-risk groups and for high-risk groups include setting up high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation rates, setting up physical barriers such as clean plastic snipe guards, and setting up a drive-through window for customer service. Administrative controls for high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay home, providing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication to the public, providing regular staff with a safe and secure environment, providing them with a safe and secure environment, providing them with a safe and effective way to respond to COVID-19 after the initial exposure, providing them with a safe and effective way to respond to the needs of COVID-19 workers, providing them with a safe and secure environment, and providing them with a safe and effective way to respond to the needs of COVID-19 workers, providing them with a safe and secure environment, and providing them with a safe working environment, and other measures that may be necessary to address the risks of COVID-19, and to ensure that the safety of personal workplace, including the safety of workplace, and the safety of workplace, are not affected by COVID-19 and other hazardous conditions.

Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial ships, including pleasure ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel if ill, keeping yourself isolated, and informing the ship's medical center immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be in the quarantine cabin. In the case of school and childcare facilities, regardless of the public transmission of the disease, the CDC recommends temporary closures if an infected person enters the school building for cleaning or disinfection.
When disease spreads to a minimum to a moderate extent in public society, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, rallies and other large gatherings, such as physical education or gathering music classes or eating in cafeterias; increasing distance between desks, separating office and holiday times, limiting unnecessary encounters, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When disease is rampant in local communities, additional school dropouts in social distancing strategies may be considered.The health risks of law enforcement personnel performing traditional daily activities are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who need to contact people who are confirmed to have or suspect COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If workers come into close contact during an emergency, their duty belts and equipment should be cleaned and disinfected using a household cleaning spray or wipes before reuse, and evidence management procedures should be followed to control and dispose of used PPE.
OSHA classifies certain health care and death services personnel as having high or ultra-high risk exposure.
High-risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who come into contact with patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If staff perform aerosol-producing procedures, or collect or move samples from patients known or suspected of COVID-19, they become at high risk of exposure.

WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown and gloves for those who are collecting, treating or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing methods.
If an aerosol-producing process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
WHO recommends using physical intervals such as telemedicine, transparent windows to reduce the need for PPE, and allowing only those directly involved in the care work to enter a home with a single COVID-19 patient, using only PPE needed for specific purposes, continuing to use the respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, allowing and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and encouraging people without symptoms to wear masks.

There are some things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do essential work that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all our departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to collaborate on what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, only we all focus on the most important projects.
Slow down now, you won't get hurt later.

We recognize that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new targets and deadlines.
What happens to the APP?
To match our new reality and daily work hours expectations, we also want to match our 2020-2021 Annual Plan delivery deadline.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which gives employees priority for essential work, giving them the opportunity to take care of themselves and their loved ones, while also meeting the demands of those who want or need to work on reduced schedules for the next few weeks.
This extension of time limits greatly reduces the workload of the current plan and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and we will update the delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this field.

Our longtime remote colleagues know that this can be a compromise, and they wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours if it is too long.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to break them down into smaller parts over a few days.
Make the meeting clear, set a schedule, and send the material ahead.
️Tools like Google Docs and Zoom, to make live collaboration and connection easier, default video.
Have a lead to facilitate each meeting, ask someone to monitor chat questions and to monitor the speaker list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
Use your wellness remover for snacks.
Join Slack on #remoties to talk to your colleagues about distribution.
HR Executive Team is looking at webinar-based argonomies guidelines to help increase distributed work across the Foundation.

Now, please-- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Hyme V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hyme V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Bioetancin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a catalyst attached to the outer layer (cellular membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestinal cells.
ACE2 counteracts the work of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing its Ang1-7 to make it a promising target drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting catalyst 2 is a zinc-binding metallolysis enzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal colectin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose excitatory activity occurs uncovered on the surface of lung and other tissue cells.
The outer domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shades, and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the membrane of lung type II alveolus-related cells, small intestinal enterocytes, mostly organ arterial and vascular endothelial cells, and arterial mucosal muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothylamus and brainstorm.
ACE2's primary function is to act as an ACE counterbalance.
ACE angiotensin I divides the hormone into vasokonstrukting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxylic-terminal amino acid phenylalanine (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) from angiotensin II and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can differentiate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 neutralizes the membrane exchange of amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in heart disease.
ACE2 serves as a key entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins to the surface of the cell in the enzyme domain of ACE2 results in the displacement of both endocytosis and the virus and the enzyme to the endosome located within the cell.
The entry process also requires priming of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently under investigation as a potential healer.
A number of professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""compared to controls, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia""".
"Additionally, ""Patients treated with ACE inhibitors, particularly those at high risk of pneumonia, and those with stroke and heart failure, also had a decreased risk of pneumonia".
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in the mortality rate associated with pneumonia, although its effects were less potent than those of the overall risk of pneumonia""".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage and appeared to improve the pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation of piglets, including symptoms of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress.
RHACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours and a start time of 30 minutes in humans, and a duration of effect (stability) of 24 hours.
RhACE2 is expected in people who cannot tolerate a class 1 renin-angiotensin system inhibitor or inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or who have a disease where angiotensin II transmission is increased.
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to identify contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person who has been in contact with an infected person (""contact"")".

Preliminary research into the efficacy of vaccines in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and mammals other than humans indicates the need for biosecurity-level 3 control levels and international coordination to ensure standardised protection practices for the management of living viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world.
When MERS emerged, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed the first clinical trials in humans and three more are underway, all of them viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts relate to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus like SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The incubation period of the COVID-19 virus is usually five to six days but can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms will be seen within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these symptomless carriers in infection is not yet fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may play a role in the spread of the disease.

Both sputum and saliva can carry a higher number of viruses.
When you speak louder than you normally do, you get more lip particles.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without a mask can spread small droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and tested positive for viral RNA, an air collector placed in the hallway outside a person's home.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopalmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory emissions to become aerial particles and result in aerial propagation.

When used correctly, soaps and detergents can also be effective; soap products break down the virus's fat protection layer, disable it, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (astropathic disinfectant), are less effective.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the highest viral load and the second test of the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with a group of patients with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature among related coronavirus.
Virus dies outside the human body in domestic soap, which shatters its protective bubble.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found in large quantities in the type II alveolar cells of the lung.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 to enter the mammalian cell".
12% of the infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, had severe cardiac arrests and were more likely to have severe illnesses.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms due to systematic inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system during the development of the disease is higher, but severe myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors of the heart.
ACE2 receptors are rapidly moving to the heart and are involved in heart function.
In ICU patients with COVID-19 infection, thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been reported and may be associated with poor prognosis.
While SARS-COV-2 tends to move towards the epithelial cells -ACE2 connecting the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-deleted monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology resumption (recruitment).
The autopsy revealed lymphocytic inflorescence.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
Testing is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by the nosopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or lip sample may also be used.

Blood tests can be performed, but they require two blood samples taken every two weeks and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strains of the coronavirus and release genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Bilateral, multi-lober ground-glass opacity with a marginal, unorthodox and retrograde distribution is common in early infections.
Subpleural predominance, irregular pewing (lobular septal filling by variable alveolar filling) and aggregation may occur as the disease progresses.
Very little information is available on the pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological data of the study of the bladder are:
Macroscopy: pluricaria, pericarditis, lung consolidation (catching of lung water) and pulmonary scarring

Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large-scale atypical pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration, and intercontinental inflammation and the formation of multicellular mammals
Pneumonia grave: Dyspersible dispersed alviola (DAD) with dispersed alviola releases.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Pneumonia sarano: organization of extracts in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular clot (DIC); leukoearithroblastic reaction
Menues to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and practicing proper respiratory hygiene and not touching eyes, nose or face with your bare hands.
CDC recommends covering with mouth and nose tissue during cough or diarrhea and using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is found.

"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19".  Since no vaccine is expected until before 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is trying to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as ""flatlining the curve"".
CDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands are visible dirty, before eating and after a runny nose, cough or diarrhea.
WHO recommends using at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers when soap and water are unavailable. WHO provides two formulas for local production where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
The antimicrobial activity in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptic""".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are driven by supportive services, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other critical organ support.
CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear masks.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory dysfunction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonology in the United States have organized medical recommendations from various organizations at the free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for initial use.
Consorations should be taken to reduce the risk of viral infection, especially in healthcare environments when performing procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation that can produce aerated particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping people in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR), in addition to using evidence warnings, touch warnings and airborne warnings.
Proposed equipment are: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirator is approved for industrial environment but FDA has approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but are not guaranteed for label-specific uses.
If no mask is available, CDC recommends using homemade masks as a face cover or last resort.
Most cases do not have COVID-19 severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of some cases do.
High-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure can prevent intubation Some evidence is that the type of respiratory aid for hospitalized people with COVID-19 respiratory failure is being actively studied in people with COVID-19 respiratory failure.

Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of healthcare management to deal with the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that are sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A Chinese study found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the ICU.
COVID-19 complicates mechanical ventilation as acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) develops and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.

COVID-19 can rapidly increase the incidence of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) in the majority of severely affected individuals, which can cause respiratory impairment, septic shock or multi-organ impairment.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and damage to the heart, kidney and liver.
In 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, abnormalities in blood circulation, especially prothrombin, have been identified, while abnormal renal function has been observed in 4% of these patients.
Transaminosis has been reported in approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19.
The same report stated that the time between onset of symptoms and death, including hospitalization of five patients, was ten days.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study identified the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third technique is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, novel technique for vaccine production).
Testing of experimental vaccines from one of these techniques for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first diagnostic trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The virus that causes the disease is in the vaccine with a genetic code that is not duplicated from the vaccine.
Over 300 active trial trials have been conducted since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating drugs already approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chlorokoquine.
Most of the studies in China are being conducted to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir across the country are expected to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the diagnostic development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. A number of existing antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Retonavir and Interferon Bitter in combination with Lopinavir/Retonavir.

On 28th March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians who treat people with COVID-19.
Initial data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further vivo studies after demonstrating a low-density elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparation of the primary spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that have prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study.
The cytokine disaster could be a complicated situation in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have anti-rapid release properties of cytokine.
