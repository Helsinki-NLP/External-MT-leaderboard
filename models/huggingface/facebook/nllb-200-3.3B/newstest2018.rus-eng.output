Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing administrative liability for violating the terms and procedures for payment for goods (works, services) when purchasing for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve the very acute problem of the non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, it was common for entrepreneurs to be unable to receive payment for government and municipal contracts that had already been fulfilled.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded contracts not supported by financing, tried to evade their payment obligations and included illegal conditions in contracts.
The problem was systemic across the country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the prosecutor's office has made 9,7 thousand representations, according to the results of their consideration, 4,5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 to administrative, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies to organize procedural checks, 46 of them have initiated criminal cases.
As a result, debts to entrepreneurs were paid off in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles.
And these vast sums were not accumulated by the non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
The debt was compounded by numerous, systematic delays in paying far more modest sums to entrepreneurs.
Here's a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for social transportation services for several million rubles.
A man has invested all his working capital, has fully met his obligations, but has not received the money on time.
The result is a growing financial burden of payroll, tax, credit, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor's office.
Now, in some regions, the problem has been brought to a maximum level.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt for state and municipal contracts, as identified by prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt levels continue to reach critical levels, prosecutors are operating in a manual crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally holds on-the-spot meetings with representatives of local authorities, at which all violations discovered by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are examined in detail.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in Part of the Establishment of Administrative Responsibility of Officials of the Customer for Violation of the Term and Order of Payment of Goods (Works, Services) in Purchases for the Provision of State and Municipal Needs" which was signed by the President of Russia last week will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers qualitatively.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by a customer's official person of the term and procedure for payment of goods, works and services at state and municipal purchases.
If the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, then he faces disqualification for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
A civil rights group has issued a travel warning in Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a travel warning for people of color in Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racially motivated attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Travel Warning, effective until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and citizens of the state of Missouri to be especially careful and exercise heightened caution when traveling in the state due to a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and here".
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group's move to issue a travel warning was prompted by a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and by the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately target minorities.
You have people being subjected to human rights abuses.
They're being stopped on the roads because of their skin color, they're being beaten and killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to the Kansas City Star.
We hear complaints more often than ever before.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racially discriminated humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas on a state trip, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The warning also cites a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which found that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the alert is to make people aware of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri", Chappell said.
"People should be prepared one way or another, whether they're taking money for a deposit or telling relatives they're traveling across state lines".
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri had 100 hate crimes in 2015, making it the 16th largest state in the nation for hate crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to prosecute a business for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) earlier issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws that ordered local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said would increase racial screening.
Travel warnings are typically issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but more recently, civil society organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown gunmen fired on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, according to Reuters, citing the Egyptian Interior Ministry.
During the shootout, two people, including one policeman, were killed, and three people were injured.
All the injured were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was captured, the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports bill to cancel free baggage for non-return airline tickets
The head of Rosturisma Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC that he was "positive" to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free luggage transportation with non-refundable air tickets.
"We need to create conditions where a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage", he stressed (quoted by TASS).
Mr. Safonov noted that despite the concerns of citizens, the cost of carrying outer clothing and mobile phones in hand luggage will not be incurred.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say that this will not be related to outerwear, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPads or even computers", the head of the Tourism Ministry said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that allows airlines to exclude the free baggage allowance for non-refundable tickets.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and executors to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered the full rehabilitation of the contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the purification facilities of most of them are worn out", - quotes "RIA Novosti" the president.
He also added that the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the lake area, associated with the emergence of natural dumps and a number of environmental violations by the organizers of the holiday.
"I want to emphasize that we should not check everything, but we should know the measure, namely, illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures", he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin stated during a direct line that legislation needed to be changed to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas under special protection.
The problem with the conduct of economic activity was reported to him by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donskoy, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the borders of the Baikal water protection zone, but the Buryatia government reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Law.
A new temple will be built in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the community of representatives of the indigenous minorities of the North "Rakhtyny", together with residents of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the riverbank, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it will serve as a way-light for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now installed, there are church bells.
The Igrim REB fleet provided transport support.
The church is named after Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, since he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Soweto, fishing gives the settlers work, food.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children are even writing essays about it as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singaporeans follow the law?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, and carefully stacks his cigarettes in the iron box he brought from the office.
After the conversation, the businessman walks to the nearest urn - a hundred yards away - and throws the bulls in.
The fine for littering in a public place is $500, Chang reports.
You know, I've had this reflex since I was a kid: You can't throw a candy bar on a bridge, you're gonna get a ticket.
And now there are cameras everywhere.
And indeed, the sidewalks of Singapore's downtown are as clean as a museum.
Chang tells us that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son graffitied the walls of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a life term.
What?!
You know what?
He got ten wooden clubs in the buttocks and spent a week in jail.
We're not unusual for corporal punishment.
How Singapore combines the highest living standards with the most stringent laws, AIF observers have figured out.
No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the government has long been indifferent to the views of both the EU and the US on this issue.
If a man carries a large shipment of drugs or sells them, he is to be hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian was arrested at Changi Airport with 400 grams of cocaine.
The Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the pope have come out in his defense.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
After that, the drug couriers go around our country.
The point is, in Singapore, the law is for EVERYONE, not just the lowly and the poor.
It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, a vice-prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The only alternative is if they find a half-pound of cocaine on you, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and see signs with a bunch of warnings everywhere, you're just amazed at how many things are off-limits in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies and can be purchased only with a doctor's prescription.
Tourists will not be deprived of their chewing gum, but if they stick a piece of gum in the subway, they will be fined $1,000 local.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks: "I trashed".
For throwing away a cigarette butcher's urn, in addition to the fine, they are often sentenced to "sweep the yard": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles is paid by a "criminal" who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to do a small need in the elevator of a residential building, a special detector is activated - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Exotic laws include bans on feeding pigeons in the street, public singing, and even excessive watering of houseplants (!), which is believed to attract mosquitoes.
Smokers can't bring lighters into the subway to avoid fires, or they'll be fined S$5,000.
Well, the idea is, no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
That's not true", Mohammed Kabir-Kajariya, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone brought to justice for breaking them.
Why are they being kept?
So the citizens don't get too relaxed.
The basic rules are strictly enforced.
For example, if a minor sells cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone will be punished: the shop owner will pay a huge sum, the offender will receive a beating of the "back", and the seller will also be deported and imprisoned.
It is because of such strict laws that crime is so rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
Back in the 1970s, we had a chaotic roadside life: motorists ignoring traffic lights, driving as they pleased, getting drunk at the wheel.
After the fines, things calmed down for a year.
Now the driver, after drinking a shot of whiskey, knows that if he is stopped, the policeman will not let go for bribery, will be fined the value of the apartment and will be sent to jail for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson described Singapore as "a Disneyland with the death penalty" - a visitor from the United States was horrified by the universal wealth of its inhabitants, "a frighteningly clean airport", and "cultured nature".
They say things like this are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
First days in Singapore and you're afraid to throw paper on the pavement, you're afraid to go on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to Little India, and suddenly there's a pattern breaking: plastic cups are falling at the bus stop.
"How?" you ask.
And this is how Singaporeans laugh.
It happens.
Not every "crime" like this gets you caught on the spot, but you should know that if you get caught, you don't get away with it because you broke the law.
This is often enough to make a person behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I was very careful as motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from tourists.
Downtown Paris is full of filthy tramps and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets throws trash in the trash cans.
Singapore, with its draconian fines and ruthless laws, including the death penalty, has become the most peaceful, cleanest and safest city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
It's human nature: remember, no one in Russia was strapped in a car until they were fined.
Although in Singapore, it's not the fines that matter, but the voluntary compliance with the laws.
And I'd think that people in Russia would be happy with clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
That's corporal punishment. Thank you.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred about it?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most certain sign of a regime change is when he starts fighting the statues.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else, hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdous Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologues in the Trump administration, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought the symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN journalist Jim Akosta about the president's proposals for a sharp reduction in legal immigration.
Let's face it, Miller didn't try to kill the statue.
A dozen boat owners and artists who painted the Statue of Liberty would have him lynched if he tried.
But he did attack its meaning, and particularly the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled to Acosta, "I don't want to go too deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller's account of the facts is correct, but as he said, it's not really about the story.
It's about the current sound of Lazarus's astonishing words, the only ones in which the state invites not just any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your weary, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / Miserable wastes of your abundant shores".
Never before has "unfortunate waste" been so prominent on our screens.
Miller wasn't a literary scholar, he was making it clear that Trump's America was not waiting for these people.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's really a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who fought to have her words placed on the base of the statue after her death, were well aware that they were committing a purely political act.
The sculpture was intended to represent the link between the French and American republics through the banal classic figure of the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a whole new name: Mother of the Banished.
The marriage of poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack on American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right though to change it back.
The loud-voiced Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist who heralded Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting, but rather an early neocon bearing America's flame to a world in darkness: "Freedom is moving forward.
She carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States".
Against the grain, Limbo really got a point.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by the tired, unhappy, but hopeful men on the decks of ships after a long and often arduous voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is responding to them with the words of hope and hospitality they've been longing to hear.
And that's certainly not a perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to embrace.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to fan the flames of hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team.
Ailid Doyle recalls the days when there were only two Scotsmen on the Great Britain team
Neil Blake, director of play for the British Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scotland squad at the World Championships would make "a significant contribution to the team's play".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships, which begin on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is "being born" in Scotland and that the British Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support them as long as they have the potential", Blake said.
"I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Association think that what they've done is something to work with.
British Athletics: What they've done, we have to work with.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why it happened, but it's absolutely brilliant".
Some of the Scottish athletes are in the running for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will be competing with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m; and Eilid Doyle has been chosen as the team captain.
"Heilid is humble.
Her captain's speech was magnificent", says Blake.
"Many of the athletes, whether Scottish or not, and wherever they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincerity that Eilidh put into it was wonderful".
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will be running in her fifth World Championships 400m hurdles, says that 16 Scots in the British team is "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scotsmen at a World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
In front is Laura Muir, a middle-distance runner who broke five British and two European records last year.
She'll run the 1500 and the 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will be competing in the 1500m, is another Scotsman to watch: he has had a successful season, winning the British team's qualifying and the annual events.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup, when the only Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but in some cases will be vying for medals and fighting for a place in the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by the other team members, so it was a huge honour anyway, but to know that your teammates voted for you and chose you is something special for me", she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It shows how far we've come.
And they're all accomplished athletes who will be striving to make it to the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I was just pointing out that we are very lucky to be hosting the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get the support of the fans and to take advantage of the fact that we're going to be in the Olympic Stadium again.
I've got another chance to go out there and compete in his arena, and it's going to be a great atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office unless you're ready to hear criticism from voters
The founding father of our country understood the critical press.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "You can take away free speech, and we, the deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter".
I'm going to go now to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should be trying to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit trivial, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "what if".
"It's just Facebook", many people would say.
But this is important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
He's second in the approval ratings of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has demonstrated a firm hand in the governance of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as his primary means of communication with his constituents and jokingly shows off his bald head from chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people from coming to the governor's website - which is billed as an official public forum and run by the administration staff at taxpayer dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters to perpetrate online mischief.
The Post talked to some of the real people that Hogan's blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors, who are addressing their elected leaders.
All of them say their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholicism.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment about how disappointed I was by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news", she wrote in the Post comment section.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some of them immediately say it's a so-called hoax instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens".
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call an "active life position".
In the Facebook era, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It's a lot less dusty work than it used to be, when it required sending people out, collecting and burning critical newspapers or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just in numbers.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, the first, the first major decisions on this issue was made this week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria U.S. District Judge James K. Casher, the chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's day, the era of affordable postage was about as revolutionary as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, newspapers quadrupled in number, and anonymous letter writers greatly undermined its authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People using the names "Uricula", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project George Washington Papers, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to shut them up.
Freedom of speech, of opinion and expression is the foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the convenience of the Renaissance Club .
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a lifestyle change in the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the twenty-fifth Open Scottish Golf Tournament for senior athletes.
The Northern Irishman, who led the neighbourhood at Archerfield Links and was on his way to the final round last year before losing to Paul Ells, is attached to the new venue and will play the role of tournament representative on behalf of the club's founder and director, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built and we are seeing it become a success", Rafferty said.
The players will see this field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He's a big believer in this game and proud of his accomplishments here.
It's a great demonstration for this field.
The Englishman Eals is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling", said the Southport player.
I didn't get to try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
Memories of the past year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was a very special feeling to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we'll always remember it.
Returning to the fight in his home country is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you're playing at home, it's always a little bit more important", said Orr, a resident of Helensboro.
You want to do well, but you feel it's an extra burden.
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far.
On the field, this trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior majors champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Aldkorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmire and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free, and parking is £5 per hour for a single person and £10 for two or more.
All the proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Semi-tunnel tunnels over motorways, capable of absorbing the carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transportation agency reported positive results from testing a 100-meter tunnel installed on a highway in the north, reports Autocar.
The 20-foot-high [six-meter] tunnel is constructed of some of the latest polymer materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in automobile exhaust.
But the network of tunnels is just one part of a larger effort by the British government to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the flow of cars on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the park of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, transportation accounts for a quarter of all air pollution, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
Moscow city court changed the sentence of disabled Mamaev to a fine
Moscow city court changed the sentence of the disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years of colony, to a fine in the amount of 200 thousand rubles.
TASS reports that the Russian government has been in talks with the Russian government.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the sentence with a conditional one, explaining its request that Mamaev's illness "prevents him from being in prison conditions".
Anton Mamaev, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in a general-security prison for a robbery of a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court in an out-of-court hearing in the detention center released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian 'golden land'
While preparing lunch, the Barden of the Degeys does not use the stove.
She rarely even uses a pickle.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just puts a sweet potato, which is called notata here, right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is pulled out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
DeGeis sits on the dirt floor - she has no furniture - and it is here that she does her household chores, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom is a bucket in a room with no roof.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not assigned to work in the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening", she says.
It's a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Etaru is as remote as it is deserted; the journey here involves a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jaipur, the provincial capital, to Nabir, followed by a five-hour shake-up in a hired car.
There's no public transportation around here.
The town of about 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses with bamboo fences; the roofs are made of corrugated steel and painted with rust in various reddish hues.
Few Indonesians have ever been here, let alone journalists, and hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Me'e Pago worshiped a deity called U'ga Tame'e.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", Degeye says, pointing to his bright hand-woven turban, dark skirt and brightly colored shirt.
We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and its infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Panay, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring one misfortune to the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains its suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy from the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
Since 1969, human rights activists say, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings of indigenous people in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, police in Indonesia arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We will lose everything, a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture  especially frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electrocution  and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
It is difficult to count the number of victims because the incidents happen every week, says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The geysers have been drawn in as Papua's resources have attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographic indicators are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javanese shop, varunggi, sells fried chicken and a vegetable mixture gado-gado, served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to survive the competition.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at the traditional market for cheaper prices than the native Papuans", explains Abet Yoo, a 24-year-old from Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
 Because of this, the indigenous Papuans  the Papuans' mama-mama (women)  have lost their market.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to tackle inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovic, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for restoring justice", Yow says.
In reality, just two months after the October inauguration of Jokowi, Paniai suffered a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols at a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles escaped from the darkness.
Frightened children told them to turn on their lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to victims and witnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government election commission building, and the next day, things got worse.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the vayta, a dance of the Papuas tribe me'e'ago: they ran in circles and imitated the birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation escalated, soldiers were given an internal radio order: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them", according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremiah Kayame, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enoratali, sensed the approaching danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse to their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist", he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from a line of soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of gunfire", he added.
Local resident Alfius Yow was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, told TIME.
I saw he was dead... I kissed him.
General Yotje Mende, the chief inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pujo Sulithio said in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the murders did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, in Jaipur, Jokowi delivered a fiery speech in which he offered condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, there were excuses.
Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early '90s.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed", he said.
Viranto then retracted his comments, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish a complaints body in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided in a court of law".
Viranto, who was charged by the United Nations with "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody East Timorese independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been addressed, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai victims have met such statements with grim suspicion.
'I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no change at all,' says Johannes.
I'm tired of it.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot.
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the people of Paniayi are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me", he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in neighboring Deia District of Paniai.
A clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help transport an unconscious man to a hospital left one dead and 17 others injured, including children.
A man, 24-year-old Ravianus Doov, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the construction site office, which belonged to the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who fired warning shots in response.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) opened fire on the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation", Dominggu Badia, a 29-year-old who lives near the hospital and saw the hurried transport of the wounded, told TIME magazine.
I hid in my house for two days.
Deia demanded that the officers involved be brought to justice and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is a source of discontent among the Me'e, Moni, Dani and Dama tribes scattered throughout the verdant central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by carrying out sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM's top executives are from Paniai, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In retaliation, in recent years, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and detained without charge by the military under the pretext of "protecting national independence".
Some of them never came back.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is equally unavailable.
The people here grow everything they eat: mostly walnuts, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can tend four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and sell the rest at the local market.
Ten notes of the club are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupiahs (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality increased between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
The few available jobs are usually filled by more educated and well-off migrants.
Papuan people rarely have the money or the skills to run their own competitive businesses.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no work and no money", says John Gobay, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua out of the eyes of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for "not coordinating with the relevant organizations" despite being issued rare video permits.
According to Felim Keen, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, promises made during the election campaign by Djokovic to lift restrictions on media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now, foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's rebellious eastern provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of press coverage means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "the diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including the shootings in Paniai.
Those same countries have supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramatta Nasir dismissed the group's claim, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses".
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch human rights ambassador Kees Van Baer, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence, pleading: "We want freedom", according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jocovy is a well-intentioned man, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting", says Gobay, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokiv to know that the people of Paniai, besides living in the shadow of a greedy army, are mired in poverty and have a poor education and health system.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Jokovi a debt that he must pay.
"They don't want money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panayi shooting carried out one last symbolic act of innocence: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly across from the police and military precinct.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not let the guilty forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family", Jacobus says, without raising his head.
What else could we have done?
Dubai skyscraper is on fire for the second time Fakel
A fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate the 79-story, 1,100-foot-high structure.
This is the second fire to hit the high-rise building - which is coincidentally called the Torch - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no immediate news on the cause of the fire.
We were asleep and woke up by the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident of the skyscraper who called himself George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Department, fire crews extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing asylum for the victims.
The incident could bring back to the fore the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Fakeela administration after the fire there in 2015 found that the most affected were the exterior panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation and cladding of London's Grenfell Tower may have accelerated the spread of the fire that killed nearly 80 people there in June.
The growth of tourist traffic in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
According to data obtained by rus.err.ee from the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists visited the North East hotels in June 2017, an increase of 125 people or 0.6% compared to the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, while the number of foreign tourists increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2%, from 12,944 to 12,525.
The most noticeable increase in the region was the number of Russian tourists - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malakhov has made it clear to his fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
He has not commented on the rumors, but today he posted a snippet from the August 1st edition of Vedomosti.
Malachov signed the photo with the tag "the boss of the milk pump".
An article on how to prevent burnout and pay attention to the condition of the employee.
If you recall the numerous reports that the presenter could not find common ground with the newly arrived producer, who took to reformatting "Let them speak", it becomes clear what he was so transparently hinting at, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and has not signed a statement to quit the First Channel.
The layoffs could be cleared up in the next few days.
Five Afghans killed in car bomb
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand province, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, a car bomb exploded near a military checkpoint in the Girish district.
20 deaths have been reported.
There was another emergency in Girish on Friday morning.
Armed criminals have attacked the currency exchange.
The firefight between the attackers and the security forces continues.
A diver caught a shark biting his camera on video.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a shark on video biting his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by the Massachusetts Division of the US Fisheries Agency, of which Skomaal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of Cape Cod in the northeastern United States, Necn reports.
A man was diving and trying to film a shark on a camera he was holding on a special stick.
The man was spotted by a three-meter-long animal that swam toward him.
The shark started biting the camera, but it wasn't trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did this to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily have destroyed the device.
He also noted that this behavior of the sea creature was new to scientists.
The reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan Training Center where the mass fight took place to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of the beating have already been released.
According to Mash, a public profile on VKontakte, the contract soldiers of the Ural military unit 31612 fought violently over an unmade bed.
It all started when a private named Sayan blatantly ignored an officer's order to fix a leaky sheet.
The soldiers of the sixth company took the officer's side.
Sayana backed up the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were beating up the bunk beds and sinks in the barracks, breaking windows.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
The C.O.D. denied the stabbing.
A study found that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carry illegal items on board.
The study found that more than 20 percent of airline passengers knowingly or accidentally brought prohibited items through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration's baggage checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane with illegal knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
A study of over 1,000 people by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly attempting to fly with something that is prohibited by the ATF, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Gen Xers.
Consciously, ATB employees are most often passed by with food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted to deliberately bringing sharp objects through the checkpoint, and 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted to deliberately bringing prohibited drugs on board.
The company said it was studying passengers across the country to find out how many were smuggling through airport security by accident and how many were doing it deliberately.
It is to be expected that the most likely to smuggle contraband through the checkpoint - whether consciously or unconsciously - is the one who flies the most.
As the company points out, ATB's rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of what the ATB is taking in is tainted fluids.
A while back, people thought that ATB might consider books off-limits.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international ones.
EPA chief Pruitt is backing off of Obama's emissions reduction plan.
The day after the 15 states sued, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt said his agency is now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than it has been under previous administrations.
He made no mention of the lawsuit against his former position filed in the federal appeals court.
The debate revolved around the October 1 deadline by which states must meet 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "disagreements with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the attorney general of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Trump to his current post, has long been known as a consistent opponent of environmental austerity.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations that the chemical or oil and gas industries opposed.
The sudden change of course on Wednesday is yet another legal defeat for the return of the old standard to the course that Puyett has taken.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had overstepped his authority by trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by changing course abruptly on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's obligation to cooperate with the states in the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, EPA often failed to meet deadlines, waited for claims from activist groups and others, and negotiated deadlines during litigation", said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous tenure.
"We don't believe in settling by litigation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the authority it gives us seriously".
However, the EPA statement said that Pruitt may at some point again use his "deferral powers and other statutory powers" to make sure that the standards "jcyjdfys on the clear course and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone regulations.
The bill, which passed the House last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed lawsuits against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue the legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course - following our lawsuits - is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that covers their cities", Schneiderman said.
New York City is joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when common pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants, among other sources, enter the atmosphere by reacting with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in susceptible people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's hard to imagine the pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from a person tasked with protecting the air we breathe", said Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and defend those who pollute the air and their special interests".
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
The congress thus backed the IAAF's board of the FFA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be maintained.
166 voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 against, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report said that the VFLA had made substantial progress in meeting the conditions set by the Board for reinstatement, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 men who were admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFLA was subject to an indefinite suspension by the IAAF in 2015.
The report by WADA's independent expert, Dick Pound, was published at the time, and it highlighted numerous WADA violations by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the latest report of the IAAF Council in the "U" article "IAAF extended sanctions against VFLA".
A painful defeat
In the 3rd round of the Fonbet-First of Russia among the teams of the PFL, Novosibirsk "Khimik" held an away match against FC "Kaluga".
Just over 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture was completely different.
"Chemical" was not inferior to the opponent, but a momentary relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and fiasco.
After the recent defeat by the Caloosa 0-3, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novoslovaks were forced to reckon with themselves and acted from defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, the Kaluga team created more and had the advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and with his actions gave confidence to the partners.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemical" did not have enough effort and luck to put in a dead end the defense "Kaluga" and scored the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game was played on the opposite courses.
The Novoslovans were more active in the attack.
The alarm bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the Kalugaans to create a number of sharp moments.
With 10 minutes left in the meeting, the Chemist has seized the upper hand and launched several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaljuans played a role - they more competently and calmly passed the finish, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemic" moved the ball to a corner, the service of which the owners of the field without resistance sent to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yury Dubrovin.
In the report meeting, "Chemik" showed a good game, but suffered a humiliating defeat.
Our team is waiting for another outing - on August 11 at 19 hours in Moscow at the "Torpedo" stadium named after Eduard Streltsov, the new Moscow will fight with the favorite of the "Center" group of FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the Chemist!
The meeting place and time of the Novoskovites is 18:30 minutes near the Magnolia store (Eastern, d.2, corps.
The composition of the "Chemist": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Homuotov, Goga (Oreshin), Dudai, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin) was also included in the list of the winners.

According to the leaked transcripts, Trump was pressing Mexico about paying for the border wall.
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The President of the United States scolded him for speaking out against the wall, and according to leaked information, told him, "You can't tell that to the press".
Trump began his campaign by promising to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
A leaked transcript of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should take refugees to Australia was "ridiculous", "disgusting", and "stupid", and insisted that the Obama administration's deal would make him look like an idiot for wanting to stop the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day.
The bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", which carries the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
The boat will be met by the staff of the ritual agency and the city's mayor, Abkhazia's deputy minister for resorts and tourism, Astaur Ahba, told reporters.
Earlier, the representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were taken by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhumi intends to pay the families of the dead compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz leadership expressed willingness to pay relatives of the tourists who died in the explosions to fly and live in the republic, but the relatives sent only trust letters to the republic to give the right to local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus, two explosions occurred, after which the large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
This caused a fire in the warehouse, which triggered uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the accident, two Russian citizens were killed - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeyeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near a sulfur spring.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with various degrees of serious injuries were taken to medical institutions of the republic.
Seven people are still in the hospital, the rest have been discharged.
The study of Russian influence on the American elections will be undertaken by the grand jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to investigate Russia's influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the authority to cross-examine witnesses under oath.
The special counsel will review the evidence and decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
The grand jury's convening gives Mueller additional authority to take testimony.
One of the subjects of the grand jury investigation, which began several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump's son and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself had previously promised to check the details of the meeting in June 2016.
They've been vetted by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal team.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he expected a meeting with Veselnitskaya to compromise the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, but no documents were presented, and the adoption was eventually discussed.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement about meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally a nod to Trump Sr.
The White House said the president didn't dictate anything, but was just using his authority, which is what any father would do.
Vice Mayor Penza was detained at work.
Penza deputy mayor Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours by the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reports.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies have not yet been received, but the press service of the SC SC SC has assured that they will follow soon.
Penza City Hall has yet to comment on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been the city planning and land relations commissioner since April 2015.
Before that, she worked for a long time as the head of the State Housing and Construction Inspectorate in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, and it is noteworthy that she refused maternity leave and returned to work a year ago after becoming a mother for the second time.
Of course, Mexico has no spaceport or launchers.
But there's a space agency that was founded in 2010 and it's very keen to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike Soviet-era monuments that are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, "walk the planet".
In 2012, a monument was erected in Houston, Texas, near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument was erected on the grounds of the Royal Observatory to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There's a monument to Gagarin in Erfurt, Germany, where our astronaut was in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) was saved from demolition in 1992 by public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarin appeared in Riga.
That's the name of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and he looks like he's turning 70.
Morse Ford murder: Activists will beat Lynch trials on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury was driving past spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and roaringly ran towards the little Morse Ford Bridge.
As the car with four black passengers and the white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The main one, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, held up a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The people inside were trembling with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
The screaming broke the silence as the young black man was dragged from the front seat.
Fortunately, the terrible scene that took place on July 22 was only a staged event.
But when Roger was put on the noose, almost everyone in the audience was breathless.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-enact the night in 1946 when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years, not one person has been arrested - even though we see them around us; even though we know who they are", says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls".
Brooks, 71, is a former congressman from Georgia who has spent his life fighting for human rights.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the residents of Monroe that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want closures, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice", he says.
"We cannot move toward healing and reconciliation until we achieve justice".
A coroner covers the plain body of one of the victims of the Morse Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been well aware of two related motives for lynching: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries that were to be held that summer.
Around the same election, the FBI reported that black exploiter Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a brawl, apparently over a woman.
Brooks says that rumors were spreading in town that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the child she was going to have was not from her husband.
According to FBI records, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they were driving from the prison to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of lynch mobs surrounded the car.
"It appears that Harrison organized and ordered the murders", concludes one FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement, "which not only participated in the murders, "but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks calls it a shortcut.
"It was an attempt to invade voting rights", he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in the city that if you register and vote, the same thing will happen to you".
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been running the annual show recreating the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is vivid, it's engaging, and it's about the deep racism that many would like to think is no longer in America.
He's hard to look at, and even harder to turn away from, but Green thinks that's what's important.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch trials because they show us our own ugliness", she says.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered in the room and listened to the play's polished review over the years.
Wade Marbeau was the director with Greene.
He's played the role of the clan's head for a few years, but he says the role hasn't gotten any easier.
"I feel like I've been soiled because that's not who I am", says Marbaud.
"But I think it's very important to remember that story, because we don't want to go back to that time".
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are re-enacting their roles.
The play begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, yelling and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Rascona shouts back.
The shot is fired.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is laughing.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What is it?" asked Ascona.
He's worried and confused.
Am I being too forward?
"No", Green says through a laugh.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'nigga' back then".
"Yeah, yeah", one of the black performers laughs.
"You must rise to the solid 'r'".
And so the energy in the room changes, the discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the sake of the play, but for the sake of the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the "N" word, it comes out sharp and clear.
No man is laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in black mourning clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the sad song "Strange Fruit" by Billie Holiday.
Her voice is broken by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators are wiping tears and sweat from their eyes.
There's almost an equal number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live just a block away.
They all endured the heavy Georgia breeze for almost eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcolm and Dorsey.
Before that, the murders were history, but now, as they stand in the same place where they lynched people, it seems like their ghosts are in the air.
As the song's final note falls, Green invites the crowd to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children lean over their heads, touch the paint that represents blood and the immobile bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead", one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself of it.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and then it's over.
Actors take the ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppet worshipper.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and then, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the play has finally fallen on him.
"It's all right", one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You had your reasons".
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are having a lively discussion about a play with a black couple they've just met.
Deniza Daplinsky has a hard time finding the words to describe what she feels after the play.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and actions... of people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you", she says.
"After that, I think lynchings still happen", she adds, "but now it's called police shooting".
In the other corner of the room, the focus is on Tyrone Brooks, as he recalls his work as a human rights activist over a meal.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"The play inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we went through, but it also teaches us", he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it".
Court fined Navalny for violations at the "Action Saturday"
Moscow's Simonovsky court fined Alexey Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of the organization of the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offence under Paragraph 8 of Article 20.2 of the Administrative Procedure Code of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the order of the organization of the rally".
Earlier, Judge Xyzyr Mussakayev of the Simonsky Court of Moscow had finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
That's the amount the judge Musakayev estimated the leaflets were distributed at the "propaganda Saturday" held by Navalny's supporters in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the propaganda materials, the police who were watching the participants of the Saturday found that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which permission must be sought from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuyev applied for the termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of the composition of the offence and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
At the "agitation Saturday" Volkov was not detained, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another associate of the oppositionist - Nikolai Lyaskin - received the same subpoenas.
Murderer of bride and three wedding guests arrested in Mordovia
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local man who shot dead four people at a wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican Office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, the 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several times at the guests of the event who came to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been opened under paragraph "a" of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Holiganism"), part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "and" of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempt to murder two or more persons, committed in a dangerous manner, from hooligan motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because wedding guests decided to take a bath and walked through his plot to the reservoir.
Energy Ministry toughening requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Russian Energy Ministry will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, HPP turbines, oil pumping and oil production facilities are commissioned, equipment suppliers will be required to share data on access to it with the Energy Ministry and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government decree is already ready and has been put to public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect "critically important energy equipment" shipped to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The EU press service said on August 4 that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded because of the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was reported earlier by "Arguments of the Week".
The press service of the EU Council said that the sanctions against the Russian Federation were extended because of the scandal with the turbines produced by Siemens, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea in circumvention of sanctions.
Today the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to extend anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of the current day, and here the decision is made, the sanctions against Russia are extended.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to get the business back on track.
On Friday, Pearson, a British education group, announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its upfront dividend by 72 percent as it embarked on a new restructuring program aimed at tackling the challenges facing its business.
These job cuts, which company CEO John Fallon says will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans to cut another £300 million ($394 million) in costs in May as part of the third cost-cutting programme to try to revive businesses hit by the rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its forecast for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 per cent increase in sales of its main product in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed by suicide bomber
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, according to a NATO report.
According to unconfirmed reports from local sources, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Karabakh urban area.
The blast is the latest in a series of deadly attacks in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in the Herat mosque blast on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a "portable improvised explosive device".
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Reporters report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
The UN reports that at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those killed in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shi'a district of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city center killed over 150 people - the deadliest attack in the country since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump evaluates whether to increase the number of US military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency overturns court action to delay air pollution law
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed its decision to delay passage of an Obama-era law requiring states to limit air pollutant emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday night, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements 2015", saying the move showed the agency's willingness to work with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and being responsive to them", Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to delay ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air quality standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming that the intent was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protections enacted by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn resistance from Democrats and environmental groups concerned about the potential health effects of large emissions.
The EPA website says that using ozone-containing air for breathing "can impair lung function and worsen respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The Association of European Businesses has opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and jobs.
The AEB statement said that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be restricted.
European Business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State or Government of the EU, the USA and Russia to develop a new line of action that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and consensus.
Deputies ask police to restrict traffic on Pskov's waterfront
Pskov people's deputies sent an appeal to the head of the UWM for the city Sergei Surin about the problem of movement along the banks of the Great River.
The deputies of the state Duma, Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Sztornikov and Valery Lesnikov, believe that motorists interfere with people walking and resting in this place.
They think that controlling drivers will help make this area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the "walkway" signs and ride freely on the embankment.
It turns out that the major renovation and improvement was for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
As the Pskov News Agency notes, in the evenings, the central embankment is patrolled by PPS motorcycle patrols and squad members.
They reduce the number of cars, but they do not stop traffic completely.
Putin demanded that investigative bodies not to seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed banning the seizure of servers and hard drives from work computers in enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the use of measures in the interests of the investigation, leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard disks from working computers and servers".
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, certify them and use them during the investigation".
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise's activities, up to the impossibility of paying taxes".
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband, footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
The celebrity is currently in the US, where he is working on labor issues.
Olga had been in Las Vegas the day before, and decided to post on Instagram.
She said she had not married, had not gotten new tattoos, and had not called her ex-husband "the man who ruined my life" - something she had wanted to do.
Buzova said she would remember the trip forever because she had a great time.
The British actor Robert Hardy has died .
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter series, has died at the age of 92.
The Independent reported on Thursday.
The actor's relatives told us about his death.
They said he had lived "a tremendous life, achieving success in film, theater and television in a 70-year career".
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he appeared with Laurence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.
Hardy is also remembered for his many portrayals of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including one of the screen adaptations of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.
For his portrayal of Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award.
Robert Hardy also had the opportunity to play the role of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on more than one occasion.
Something has gone wrong in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, who is actually Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his noble wife, Queen Margret.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparing for the celebrations, but a funeral debate.
His Highness refused the title of Prince Consort, claiming that the Queen had never granted him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, though he remains officially the Queen's husband.
Russian Foreign Ministry urges Washington to stop shaming Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the comments of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Foreign Office issued a statement to that effect some time ago.
In its comment, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War tropes that are inadequate to the modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop harassing the Russian Federation.
As Arguments of the Week reported the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and orchestrating a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, and talk of a deciding match is rife.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be steadily moving toward having the most exciting boxing match in the under-147s in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the Los Angeles office of ESPN until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the second-lightweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories, Erien Broner, on Saturday on the Showtime channel, both boxers entered the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?"
Good luck to you.
Lomachenko defending his belt in a match against Miguel Marrilaga on Saturday night at 7:00 on ESPN.
As the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko's manager, Aegis Klimas, noticed that a potential deciding fight between them would be perfect.
"I used to be a semi-lightweight", Garcia recalled.
I've moved up to the 140-pound category for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm too small for 140.
I want to go down to the half-lit.
He needs to get to the half-light, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that.
Lomachenko has agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via the PPV service as part of a strategy he has in place for Lomachenko to fight his debut at 135 later this year to set up a meet next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight could be on PPV because all the fans asked for it", Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that offers the best financial terms.
We are the main names.
No other name would be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is "a terrific boxer" and might attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately shower Garcia with praise and said he thought the Riverside triple champion looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you're asking for a knockout".
Garcia said he was focused on showing the power of the punch, and then the boxing.
They both said they felt the tension build up before their own fight.
This fight has to happen.
No other fight has generated so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was expecting a top boxer, and here he is, Mikey".
It's going to be a great fight.

The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5th until 5 a.m. on August 7th due to their improvement.
Also, the Moscow River Embankment will be closed on weekends.
The construction of the "Guardian" park is still going on.
Putin instructed the Prosecutor General to check the Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal region for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the General Prosecutor's Office to check the Baikal territory for illegal and ecologically harmful activities", Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
The Russian leader also asked for action if violations were found.
New test results for asylum seekers' age assessment in Sweden published
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who underwent a new medical age assessment method show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age estimation in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the test subjects were rated as 18 years or older, and in 25 cases the forensic medicine agency rated the test subjects as "likely to be 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was probably under 18.
Tests are only carried out when the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson of the forensic medicine agency, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics from the previous months, the numbers are quite appropriate", he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where people are assessed as over 18 years old does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, "the most likely age of the test subject is 18 or older".
However, after reviewing 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking x-rays of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose part of the job is to assess people's biological maturity to determine whether they've gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that we use now.
Biological age is very inaccurate.
If we can't pin it down with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
However, Göranssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, we can say that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person is about to turn 18, in this case, about 10 percent.
I'm thinking about running for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider running for the Russian presidency in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Chereshmushki in the Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk regions, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential elections are held, we all ask you to run again for this post".
"Well, I'll think about it, thank you", the president said in reply.
On July 28, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on some media reports that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of the president of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "baseless, hypothetical reasoning".
"As long as there are no headquarters, it is far from the creation of headquarters, it is far from the election campaign", Peskov said.
"As long as it's not on the agenda", Peskov said.
The governor of West Virginia has announced that he's switching parties.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday at a rally attended by President Trump that he is switching parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me", Governor Justice said.
"Today I say to you with much prayer and much reflection... "I say to you today, the people of West Virginia,
The rally erupted in applause.
"So tomorrow I'm changing my registration to Republican", Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play differently.
Earlier, Trump promised that a major statement would be made at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won West Virginia by a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes says is the state's only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more likely to be hampered than worked to make our country great again".
"With only 15 governors and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message", Ronna McDaniel, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, told CBS News in a statement.
A cat named Mr. Handsome found a home on social media.
A Pittsburgh (North Carolina) resident has adopted a cat named Mr. Handsome, who weighs more than 30 pounds (14 kg), after he became famous on the Internet.
That's according to Mashable.
In late June, a Facebook account of the kennel posted a photo of the cat asking for help in finding its owner, because "it was obviously fed before".
In comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's muzzle could become a new meme.
The post has garnered more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to take Mr. Handsome in.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his extra weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American woman said that she had a similar experience: she took home a cat that weighed about 10 kilograms [30 pounds], and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users noticed an Australian cat with unusually long legs.
The post with the animal's photo has garnered over 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could have made a career in the modeling business.
Kou praised Russia's "sincere" apology over the doping scandal
International track and field specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sporting competitions again.
Dmitry Shlyakhtin, the Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics, told the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championships in Light Athletics, that the exclusion of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen from the competition".
Despite his comments, the IAAF congress voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-sponsored doping.
"I thought the response today, the report today, was very sincere", Kow, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
 The whole council and the whole congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the reconstruction of the federation.
Kow said he also "liked" that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and we're moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special committee that now is not the time to restore Russia's rights", Coe said.
We must do everything we can to remedy this situation in the next few months.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from a stained system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will compete under a neutral flag at the world championships in athletics, which begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has a number of requirements to meet to recover.
As he told reporters in London after a report to the International Association of Athletics Federations' board, drug testing is still not done in sufficient quantity, and suspended coaches are still doing their jobs.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Journalist Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has been sent to prison for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the online publication "Journal Zhitomira" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian sites and of encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities' measures against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the migration crisis in Europe peaked, Italy has decided to launch a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship Commandante Borsini entered Libyan territorial waters to join the Libyan navy to stop the flow of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome coordinated it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country.
The anti-Cabinet and Tobruk-based Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
Rome, however, said it did not believe the threats and would send another warship into Libyan waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Sarraj.
Italian authorities have launched a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of migrants who have crossed the border from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The government has said that the resources to receive migrants are exhausted.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian national team in light athletics excluded from the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in running for short distances, were excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This is reported on the website of the country 's Light Athletics Federation (FLAU).
The decision was made by the executive board of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) against female athletes.
The Ukrainian delegation also excluded coach Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athlete of doping.
Povch is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the 2010 European champion in the 4 x 100 meter relay, Zemlyak is the 2012 European champion in the 4 x 400 meter relay.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from August 4 to 13.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which are aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs, will not prevent the world record transfer of Neymar from Spanish "Barcelona" to French "Paris Saint-Germain".
Whatever consequences may follow for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body of European football, whose power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament is unprecedented.
The financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG could definitely be ripped to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, considering the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FPV was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that went into huge debt in their quest for success were essentially cheating and risked bankruptcy if the banks or owners stopped financing them.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on clubs' debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential, and then to spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - has become a difficult plan to execute.
During the current three-year assessment period, covering 2018, clubs could suffer losses of €30 million.
And although Platini was shamelessly removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
"Of course, the FFP is alive, and we're going to tighten the rules moving forward", Andrea Traverso, who oversees the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the PGA will pay for Neymars contract in one lump sum, he can allocate the amount for the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown in the annual accounts as an expense of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions by the FFP in 2014, the PSG and Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City were hit with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG was fined 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit its squad in the Champions League during the 2014-15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial inspections by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored the "PSJ", if the amount of funding was considered to be above standard market valuation, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of funding for the PSJ by the Qatar Tourism Authority was overstated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings in the PSJ could have come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 world championship in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the PFA means that UEFA will be even more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As people familiar with the situation reported on Thursday, UEFA did not have any preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the situation with the AP.
According to the latest published accounts, in 2015-1016 PSJ received over 10 million euros profit with a turnover of 542,4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year hasn't been published yet.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a fertile ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of team merchandise and the sale of a team logo T-shirt.
The club is expecting a turnover increase of at least 30 percent due to the new signing.
Undoubtedly angered by the departure of one of their best players, the Spanish league tried to block the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSG would violate the financial fair play.
"This is an obvious case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of the PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's state funding.
"This is all the consequences of participation and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
When the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It's very difficult to be fair-play financially, because there are many ways and many reasons for a country to be represented by such a serious player.
The president will determine the order and place of swearing in
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the lawmakers were planning to directly define the oath-taking process in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as those who are incapable, will be exempted from taking the solemn oath, according to the draft amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (which is in the possession of "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
The idea of introducing an oath when entering Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading in a bill that would repeal the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (No. 2 of Art. 205.2 of the RF Criminal Code), as well as for hijacking an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (No. 4 of Art. 211 of the RF Criminal Code).
According to the bill, its logic was that by issuing citizenship documents, a person signed a promise to abide by Russian law - by taking the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was introduced in the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies passed it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been reworked again.
Now it says that the order of swearing in will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, the text of the bill did not make it clear where such an event should take place - the list of places where the emblem of the Russian Federation can be placed is regulated by the corresponding federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state authorities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
Most likely, it could be the Zags.
Those wishing to become Russian citizens will take the oath after the officials have checked their documents.
But a Russian passport will be issued only after taking an oath, according to the revised text.
A week ago, the bill said that the oath must precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russians will be sworn in at 18, not 14.
The rule was retained that the inability or limited capacity, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath by hand, will be exempt from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure "other persons",
Also, the updated bill prescribes a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian residents who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the competent authority of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will need to be passed to Russian officials.
The renunciation of "foreign" citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible "for reasons beyond the person's control".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among whom were the first vice-speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a letter from Ukraine is unrealistic, impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for their fate to be decided on the issue of citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the State Committee on State Construction and Legislation Pavel Krashennikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have written a letter refusing "other" citizenship and surrendered a previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond its control" did not cease to consider him a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are banned from holding positions in the municipal service, from being employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring Russia's security.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
The law is expected to take effect on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary bylaws should be in place.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "hot american summer" and "fellow detective"
The current iteration of the story is both nostalgic about the characters' glory days in the '80s; about the grunge era in the '90s (around the time that outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and about herself - that is, about 2001, before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is both the elevation and embodiment of our age with its constant reminders of Facebook.
But as a franchise, it feels anachronistic.
"First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just for its absurd humor (including the original story of a talking vegetable can, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubled by the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually troubled children who have just reached adulthood; this makes the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", where the adults played the adults, has less emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from stalker movies of the 90s like "Hands That Rock the Cradle".
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
A lot of the plot twists are the same.
The good-natured Coop (Shawalter), now a writer, has yet to win back the love of Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And then there's the insane and vile conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), who is now being abetted by George W. Bush (a tried and tested parody by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the back-and-forth.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Raddo singing a Matt Dillon song from Lonesome Girl, whose character, the formerly big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
The franchise would be a series of random, recurring Seven Up craziness until it reached what I think would be its logical conclusion, Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, where the final scene would be the entire company going to the movie theater for the premiere of Hot American Summer.
"The Detective's Companion" on Amazon is turning to a different type of nostalgia: the Cold War memories of "The Americans", "Blurry Blonde", or even "The Shining", with its images of the struggle of East and West.
This comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Riz Thomas depicts a telefilm: a Romanian police drama of the 80s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles of the life-witness Gregor and the idealist Joseph are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulic, and their dialogues are voiced in English by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a great idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess match, like Americans might watch football).
The team of famous voice actors behind the scenes - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it an interesting "guess your voice" game.
But "Friend of the Detective" is so committed to the credibility of clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask - that it often looks like it.
Six long episodes are overdue, and funny is rarely, if ever, funny.
If it were shorter, "Comrade Detective" could have handled its agitated satire better; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, there are two fat people in the lobby eating a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of making a meal out of anything.
The fictional Romanian filmmakers are not so wrong: we do this even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup between Spartak Moscow and Lokomotiv Moscow will be about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the president of the Russian football premier league (RFPL) Sergey Prydkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this sum, RT reports.
He also added that there are almost no tickets left for the match at the moment.
The Spartak-Lokomotiv match will be played on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufians cleaned a furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
A 37-year-old man from Ufa, who owns a furniture company, called the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The thieves were caught with tools worth almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic jack, a winch.
The guards of order began to search for the criminals and soon came out on the inhabitants of the Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, the 23 and 24 years old friends.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and took out the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first auto body shop they could find.
They have already been charged with theft, and law enforcement officials have only been able to return some of the stolen tools to their rightful owners.
The State Department commented on Medvedev 's words on the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The U.S. and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This was the statement of the official representative of the state Department, Heather Nauert, in response to the words of the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US has put an end to hopes for improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war with Russia.
Commenting on the remarks, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that "areas for interaction" should be sought.
"Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been in place for almost a month".
"This is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia", the diplomat said, according to RIA Novosti.
The foreign ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the Russian prime minister's statement that the sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
He also admitted that the document was a failure and contradicted the US Constitution.
Dior grew roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewellery division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has added to the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line includes two new rings and a pendant made of amethyst, rose quartz and diamonds, executed in the technique of gliptics (hand carving on stone) and paving and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of the Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that the designer Christian Dior grew on his estate in Granville, and by the Parisian gardens of the Bagatelle and the Pre-Catalans.
Trump found the culprits behind the deterioration of relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has issued a sharp criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine", the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
They will affect Russian banks and energy companies in particular.
The White House subsequently released a statement from the president in which he indicated that the law would prevent the US from making profitable deals and would further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank
The Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the application to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC as "concentrating on our other planned investments and projects we are working on".
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best time investment", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary.
Mr. Prokopen became the main bidder for the purchase of the Russian bank's unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the bid of the NorvikBank consortium of Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company of Said Gutseriyev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial institutions - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of the blackout in Crimea
The Russian Energy Ministry has named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, explained the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a road accident in the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck that hit the road has blocked the power lines, resulting in the disconnection of the Kuban and related Crimean networks.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were reported last week.
The specialists fixed the problem within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the blackout was caused by an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have put to rest rumors of a possible hike.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain static, and has left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members voting for a rate increase this month because weak economic growth has weakened support for a rate increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank capped its forecasts at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to around 3% in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes over the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that borrowing costs would likely have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to abandon part of a massive package of economic development measures launched a year ago in the wake of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close its emergency funding plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has said it now has to provide another 15 billion pounds  to 115 billion pounds under this plan.
In the rate decision minutes, the bank said: "According to the MPC's main forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth will remain sluggish for the foreseeable future, while the pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption".
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation it would require "some tightening of fiscal policy" to an extent "slightly greater" than the markets expected.
Right now, the markets are predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all raises would be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank's forecasts for growth this year and next are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank has left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
Since this news, sterling has fallen against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth figures had dampened the rising expectation of a rise; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly towards the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report has given little cause for joy to households hit by high inflation and very small wage increases, which the bank says will increase before declining.
The bank added that fiscal policy could not prevent a pay shock in the next few years, but it expected wages to recover significantly by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of rising demand for British goods, driven by a low pound exchange rate that is offsetting some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which saw the pound plunge.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on rates, there was a growing buzz around the alleged rate hike as inflation increasingly put pressure on already-stressed households: three members of the panel asked for a 0.5% rate hike in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, though the bank said it was expected and would be offset again in the coming months.
The bank said the higher figure compared to the planned 2% was entirely due to the low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of Koreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent drop in swap rates, it seems that the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive as lenders demand business opportunities and look for a good year-end.
The market looks particularly favorable for those nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with no commission and a low interest rate, are becoming more popular than ever.
State health service to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a revolutionary HIV prevention drug after a battle in the High Court over the drug's funding from the NHS.
England's National Health Service has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in those at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the NHS to approximately 10,000 people over an initial three-year trial period.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PHE despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called a "major innovation" by Simon Stevens, the head of England's National Health Service, and a "turning point" by the National Aids Control Agency (NAT).
Before the full roll-out across England by April 2018, venereal clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medication taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection in people at high risk.
Taking PrEP before sex is enough of a certain drug to prevent HIV infection.
These drugs can be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for treatment include gay and bisexual men, transgender men, and people whose partners are HIV positive and not receiving successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select eligible participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals whose partners are not known to be HIV-constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to apply for a potential place at the nearest venereology clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the NHS in England signed a contract to supply the drug this week after an international tender.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience for the drug, its absorbability and its large-scale use.
This major innovation should complement and reinforce the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades of progress against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency), said: "This is a watershed moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it's targeted properly at people who are vulnerable and need it, could be a game changer for the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study funded by the National Health Service in England, will have access to a new, groundbreaking drug that can be administered by the individual without consulting a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first thing we need to do now is make sure that the trial is rolled out across the country quickly and that no one in the high-risk group for HIV is left behind.
Now that we have the experimental PrEP, we're on our way to protecting over 10,000 people who are at risk for HIV.
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the start of the PEP trial, which has been delayed by months of delays and delays by the government".
This data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PRP.
Now, it's important that the trial be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk of HIV and to take us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in our society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on supporting the treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of preserving the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positive form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people".
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the Treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which came into force on July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and to keep the name of the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only federation subject that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose title is called "president".
Russia has problems with international driving licenses
The DETC is experiencing a shortage of international driver's licenses .
The waiting list for the permits, which has been a real problem for holidaymakers who want to go abroad on vacation with their car or to rent it, has been extended to several weeks.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The purpose of the VIN was to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written on a national identity card, since the information is explained in five languages.
International law is enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian law is still recognized.
However, in practice, it depends on the specific police or rental company: some require an MVA, and some are satisfied with national rights.
To protect themselves, drivers still get international rights, but it is worth considering that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IMU.
There is a problem with the forms in almost all departments of the traffic police, according to Kommersant, after conducting a study in several regions.
For example, in Moscow, the UGID units simply do not issue the forms, the forms have been missing for four months.
You can register on the public services website, but the queues are long until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an MIA "for technical reasons", without going into detail, in the Samara region, they honestly say that there are no blanks, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, with messages like this one increasingly appearing on social media:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international law in Moscow?"
Right, because all the D.E.A.D. offices are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to those who know!"
We need to get international clearance as a matter of urgency.
In Moscow, all the time is blocked far ahead, the place does not issue the tickets at all (the button is there, but the ticket cannot be given).
It's like the public-service portal shows that there's no time to fuck.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driver's license forms have changed, so new forms are being supplied to the subdivisions of the State Motor Vehicle Inspection.
That could be related to the deficit, although it's not clear what changes are involved, as this has not been reported before.
The blanks are purchased by the Center for Special Purposes in the Field of Road Safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplied to the departments of the State Road Traffic Safety Department.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak JSC: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand VMs were produced, in 2016 15 thousand blanks were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with OOO "First Printing yard" for the production of 70 thousand blanks.
There's a theory that the CSN just didn't get the tender in time, which is why the shortage occurred.
However, there are other versions of the lack of tickets: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries like China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights they accept there is not entirely clear, so people are overinsured, and so there is a huge demand for international "short".
It has recently been announced that professional drivers will have to take an exam to prove their qualifications.
The Ministry of Transport has made such a proposal.
The new international driving licence (IDC) is valid from 31 May 2011.
Ukraine 's Justice Minister refuses to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukraine's Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he does not believe Russia has the ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
He said this in an interview with the Observer portal on Friday, August 4.
No self-respecting international company will even put a pin or a pimple there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan - countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
"In my deepest conviction, this project has no prospects", Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can't build anything smaller.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums have already started to fall apart.
"Therefore, I believe the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that are so shortsighted as to join this project", the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the enlargement assembly of the auto-road arch of the Crimean bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared the railway arch for installation on the railway piers", the project information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the object is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
Spanish official fired after 10 years of absence
What angelic patience (or complete indifference to public service) was the chief of the Spanish official, Carlos Risio, to have?
The permanent walk stretched out over 10 long years.
Mr. Resio was fired, though.
But not to your immediate superior.
Which is something that doesn't happen in the world of bureaucrats.
The public seems to have gotten used to all the "servant of the people" pranks.
And yet, officials consistently manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live.
This time, the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, Valencia archivist Carlos Risio managed to avoid work for ten years.
He was paid regularly.
And that's a good 50 thousand euros a year.
And now Mr. Rescio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was dismissed by the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that the malicious stroller came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to check in with the electronic system.
And then I went home.
He was back at work at 4:00 p.m. to sign off on the system that he was gone.
For ten years.
It also became known that the stroller devoted all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking of how to punish Mr. Ressio's immediate superior, who could not have known how to "actively work" in his workplace under his subordinate.
Judges are offered protection from chairmen .
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (PCHR) on the instructions of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of power.
The ECHR proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and introduce their electiveness.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
This work was carried out by the HRC on the instructions of Vladimir Putin of January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with the members of the council.
At the meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016, there were also some cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "Ъ" on 9 December).
The result of the work of the HRC was 25 proposals that concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and identifying judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the court presidents to increase the independence of the other judges.
If a candidate for a judgeship successfully passes the competition and receives the support of the judicial community, the court president, in the opinion of the HRC, should propose him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to allocate cases for consideration among judges.
Experts believe that a computer program designed specifically for this purpose can do this.
The ECHR also considers that the chairman has no right to "predetermine the results of the qualification assessment of the judge, initiate his disciplinary action, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
The presidential council considers it necessary to move to "election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to entrust them with powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the chairmen of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes to reorganize the appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The ECHR says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts".
The experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
They have "court districts", which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee a greater independence from regional officials, who have difficulty using "telephone law".
The HRC proposes that the number of lay judges be increased by the number of people's juries, so that they can handle certain "categories of civil and administrative cases".
For example, about the loss of parental rights, about reinstatement in the workplace, about the protection of honor and dignity, about the loss of driving rights, etc.
"These are just our proposals", - explained to "Kommersant" the member of the Human Rights Committee, the judge of the Constitutional Court in resignation Tamara Morshakova.
She also recalled that the president's order was not only for the HRC, but also for the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time for the task to be completed by the Supreme Court (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Russian Human Rights Commissioner) is still available.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, Supreme Court Chairman Vyacheslav Lebedev must report by September 1.
Living the high life: a half-story and clever design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earl's Court into a spacious residence
Joan Lee, a former banker with a passion for property repair, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a beautiful Queen Anne-style model home, and the new design is supported by the fact that Joan didn't pack up and move in again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge, on a lot more land", Joan says.
I was looking for something that would match my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price that very day.
Since the first inspection, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
It was originally a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-story to make the most of the generous ceiling heights.
I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
"These were my demands", she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5-foot ceilings to create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would also be fit for Joan to live in.
The ceiling was not high enough to allow two rooms to be placed one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-story where one could stand fully.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the briefing.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult", he explains.
We had to arrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other and didn't have to bend over.
Instead of simply building a simple platform, we had to bend the structure so that it was at the right height and allowed us to use the space above and below.
This solution allowed Erfan to create two full-size rooms one above the other in a designated space  and much more interesting.
From the upper half of the floor, a stained copper light window from the Retrouvius overlooks the luxurious living room below.
Mirrored furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures by Serge Muay set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored security panel seems like a window to another room.
The mirrored cabinets in the entrance are for all Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can be a wall around the kitchen when it's not being used.
There's nothing new about folding kitchens.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a sliding up door, like a garage.
"It was an engineering feat", says Erfan, referring to the steel-reinforced wood-fibre shield door.
It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.
Through a wise use of space and storage, Joan gained an additional 40 square feet [16 sq m], an extra bedroom, and an improved layout.
"After all, floor space is what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is valued at", says Erfan.
"Basically, the real estate agent will go in and do the calculations based on the floor area".
Here, they were able to increase the floor area using high-quality materials that add a touch of luxury to the space.
"The materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home", Erfan says.
No one falls in love with a power line in a wall.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts.
It's a testament to the fact that with good design and a large footprint, an apartment can go from ordinary to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
Government approves creation of commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for their implementation.
The head of the commission is appointed as the deputy chairman of the government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved the plan for the implementation of the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 measures and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the unified cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries down to eight-year low
Consumer price inflation in the G20 countries has fallen to an eight-year low, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower than in October 2009, when the price growth index was 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported that the consumer price index in Russia had fallen by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to the Ministry, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on the ecological development of the Baikal natural territory.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows for the cutting of forests during firefighting, and the government plans to adopt it as early as the fall.
In turn, the president said that the project should be monitored so that "not everything is cut down in a row" during the logging process.
Donsky noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: USF soldiers secretly negotiate with Donbass militia
Regular telephone communication is established on the armed front line in Donbass.
The combatants of the opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other by mobile phone, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
The soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the militia of Donbass have established communication by cell phones secretly from their high command.
On August 4, "Strana.ua" reports this with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all household: commanders try to reach some "tactical agreements".
Often, such talks result in a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when congratulations on the birthday of a particular officer were received from outside the front lines, from his formal enemy.
Ukrainian troops and militiamen of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbass.
The Foreign Ministry condemned the blocking of the UN Security Council statements on attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomats who are blocking the UN Security Council's press statements condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The agency recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 was hit by mortar fire from the terrorists of the groups "Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (former "Jabhat an-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Faylak Ar-Rahman" for the third time in a month.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in qualifying the Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem self-evident that the Nusra terrorist attacks should meet with universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions".
However, as the diplomatic service stressed, "for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of objections, hiding behind the arguments of the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft of the brief statement of the Security Council for the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital".
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us should be on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity", the foreign ministry said, adding that "it would be unfortunate if these barbarians were convinced that someone in the Security Council is with them".
Vladimir Putin is in favor of limiting the number of unplanned business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said that it was necessary to limit the duration of inspections by ten days.
"Extra-plan inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% are agreed with the prosecutor's office, the rest are independent", the president is quoted as saying by TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
Furthermore, according to the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity, or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship", - said the head of state.
As reported by "Ъ", due to the moratorium on conducting scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, a survey was conducted by the Business Ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, which revealed that the replacement of planned inspections with unplanned ones (the share of those who encountered them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial ones (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens' applications (increased from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

The brothers are fighting over a $500 million real estate empire.
Two brothers fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton football club executive and developer Colin de Lutyers lives in the Toorak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a Supreme Court action against him over the division of his property and assets.
Paul has been trying to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a heated debate over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth over half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought the Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutyens' list of holdings today includes office buildings, development lots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an arrangement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutyens family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, that means Colin's estate is worth $316 million and Paula's is $176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division Colin proposed gives him, in my view, the best parts of the property", he wrote in his first deposition in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court hearings took place.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control an existing business - one that Paul believes Colin has excluded him from.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority", he wrote.
The legal costs are skyrocketing: the case is packed with hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including the king's attorney Allan Myers, and the best of the strippers.
Mrs. De Lutyess and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants; they had been running milk bars and restaurants since the late 1950s, and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last year of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) ".
Anna De Lutyce says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their reign to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he did not want the brothers to be involved in the legal case", she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the DeLuce group of companies; Colina says Mark received $10 million when he went out of business, and Luke received $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "displeased with the financial condition of their department".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGee, a TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded, a text message saying that since the case had not yet gone to trial, "I really don't have much to say".
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and sue our family", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I arguing in court", he said, adding that he "still hopes for a resolution".
Friday, that hope seemed to have been dashed.
"The court will soon render a decision in our case", Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's access to information.
Others have tried to do so and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in hopes of keeping the chief in a more relaxed state.
This is what reporter Josh Daugherty reports.
"In a meeting with the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, on his first day in office, he identified the number one problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: the poor channels of information flowing to the president".
Kelly told the staff that the information should come through him - in paper form or through briefings - because the president will make better decisions if he gets the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have already failed to appease Trump by tracking his incoming information.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV habit is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was upset about the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded", Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico that "six former campaign staffers said that to control Trump's Twitter habits, they had to make sure that there was a steady stream of praise in the personal information".
I'll see you.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign staffers know something that we don't, like that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would have been even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into competing factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - credible or not - that supports their views.
Politico, to make matters worse, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly feed the president dubious information.
Here's one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump aides say Trump can react very strongly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and won't rest until he finds who was behind them.
That happened in late February, when someone handed the president a print-out of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Kathy Welsh accused her of being "behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn't present concrete facts, or that in the past he launched false accusations and then denied them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Welsh".
Goldmacher adds that then-Chief of Staff Rains Priebus and Staff Secretary Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them".
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides still fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor's office fights with HIV-dissent
The prosecutor's office has challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local woman whose young daughter died of HIV.
The investigation claims that the child died because the mother was HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court acquitted her in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot go unpunished, so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a woman from Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother is HIV positive herself.
"The woman did not take the treatment herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist", the Tyumen region prosecutor's office explained.
The criminal case was submitted to the Kalininsky district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that he "forgave his wife, he has no claims to her, she has made up for the damage and apologized".
The prosecution disagreed with the court's decision and filed an appeal, demanding the annulment of the decision to terminate the case and send it for a new review.
The girl is dead, and there's no way to make up for the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection", the prosecutor's press service reported.
The watchdog said she should be punished or other HIV dissidents would follow her example.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, about 12 HIV-positive children in the Tyumen region are now not receiving medical care because of their parents' refusal.
"The situation has improved - in the first year of the special group's work, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat their children for HIV have changed their mind - they have been allowed to be diagnosed, and have started taking medications", said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
She says that the law does not allow parents to be influenced, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children are detected - mothers are not allowed to be tested, they hide, they run away with their children from hospitals.
How HIV Dissidents Are Dangerous
Late last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV dissident refers to people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take HIV medication.
Doctors and AIDS-serving NGOs call such views anti-medical and see their spread as a serious threat.
The gruesome photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A merry party of drunken young men were walking across the railroad bridge where a freight train had stopped.
One of the friends had the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, reported "FAKTAM" in the communication sector of the police in Khmelnytsya region.
The boy started to climb down from the bridge onto the train, but due to his carelessness he got caught by an electrical line and was instantly electrocuted.
Fortunately, the station dispatcher learned of the incident and immediately called an emergency.
Before the arrival of doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsya regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with a 1-2 degree torso burn.
His condition is now considered stable by the doctors.
Law enforcement officials say extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving vehicles have become increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and to avoid such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have admitted the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
Ancient Venus may have had oceans.
This is what French scientists have suggested.
Scientists have created a computer model that shows how water forms on the surface of planets, reports Science News.
It turns out that early in its history, Venus had oceans that were 10 percent more water than we have on Earth today.
Earlier, Arguments of the Week said that scientists hypothesized that an ocean may have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts have concluded that the water body was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a shooting in a San Francisco park.
Three people were wounded in a shooting in San Francisco, according to the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, with a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge started shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a gun and started shooting people.
The attackers' faces were not visible, as they were blindfolded.
Another received medical attention and was released.
The third victim is a minor, details of his condition are unknown.
Located on a hill, Dolores Park is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors sustained injuries while trying to leave the premises.
Louna rock band will present their new album in Barnaul.
The concert of rock band Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The band will be performing their new album, "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The band is preparing a concept show that will be the brightest in the band's concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is a reference to the famous anti-utopian novel by O. Huxley, "A Wonderful New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values".
The money for the album was raised by the group's listeners: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the website "Planeta.ru".
Her first album, Make It Loud! was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the record "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We - it's Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Louna group performed with the symphony orchestra in "Crocus City Hall" with the program "Songs of Peace".
The band is composed of Lucine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Rubin Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums) and the rest of the band.
The concert will be held at the Faroon Club in Barnaul on October 17 at 19:00.
The price of tickets: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "The Damn Dozen".
The gypsies have crossed the moat and returned to the street of millionaires
Some of the wealthiest landlords in the West Midlands are again in conflict with determined Roma who have overcome a ditch dug by the municipal authorities to reoccupy the field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihull Street, jokingly called "Millionaire Street".
Bringing horses, babies, and a host of wheeled houses, they returned after being driven out no further than May, and were not prevented by a ditch dug by municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breach in the defensive structure and pushed their vehicles through the section that was left unfenced to make room for a footpath.
Angry residents attacked the Solihull municipality, saying it was "unable to solve the problem".
An anonymous local resident reported: "They came here on Monday night after being chased away from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passersby".
The city should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and now they're back.
More Gypsies came last night, and maybe more today.
"The City of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks", she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the city tax, and the city can't even put a stop to it.
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave last time, and please, this plague continues".
This time there were more of them, and we even saw horses grazing on the meadow.
A Solihull municipality official said: We are aware of an illegal camp on the land near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull police; we are taking the necessary legal action to evict them as soon as possible.
To help us in our evidence-gathering efforts, it's important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police on 101.
It gives us a sense of the situation that the court will be dealing with when we present our case.
Crimea is going to take over the New World Champagne Plant
The State Unit of the Republic of Crimea "Champagne Wines Plant "New Light"" decided to be acquired by transforming into the OJSC "Champagne Wines Plant "New Light"", follows from the order of the Minister of property and land relations of the Crimea Anna Anyuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state property of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint stock company will be 595,5 million rubles. and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if funds for the modernization of the enterprise were not found within the next three years, there would be a threat of the plant being shut down.
The main equipment is about 60-70% worn out.
The company needs 1.2 billion rubles to modernize the enterprise. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget.
What's left isn't enough to carry out the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about the attraction of borrowed funds from large credit organizations", - said the deputy head of the Ministry of agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament has included the company in the forecast plan for privatization in 2017 .
It was proposed to take stock and put it up for auction.
An Interfax source in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $40 million, and the investor's investment in modernization at $30 million.
"New Light" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, "New World" intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the estate he purchased Novy Svet.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Third-grade students from Nizhny Novgorod destroyed more than 40 tombstones
The employees of the State Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones at the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third-graders.
The first statement that the grave slabs were damaged by unknown persons, was received in the Russian OMIV in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
Twenty-four people have called the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Russian Criminal Code "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places".
Police have identified the suspects as two schoolchildren, aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the fall of monuments, which motivated them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone on NGO rescue ships.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue their work unless they comply with new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities", said Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the daily newspaper Stampa in Turin.
The warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been in operation for just over a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will remain our top priority, and we regret that we cannot continue our search and rescue efforts at this time", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only evaluate all the charges that have been made now "after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation".
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventus, owned by the "Jugend Rettet", since October.
His crew is suspected of taking in entire lifeboats, which were then sent directly to them by traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, the contents of which were published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastguard, who oversee rescue operations in the area, more out of humanitarian zeal than any other motive.
The code of conduct essentially requires that ships like the Juvenet have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Malta's MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable as long as they did not cause any "significant changes or disruptions" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign the declaration was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He announced plans to further negotiate with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to be associated with any side of the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy towards Libya, and the delegations of the warring Libyan parties have visited Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group for the intra-Lybia settlement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant of the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Denigov told "Ъ" what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it is betting.
The Libya Contact Group you lead is a little-known entity.
Let's say, the contact group on Ukraine - everybody knows about it.
And here, the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya. - "Ъ").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mehanik Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Ъ").
We were thinking about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group was created from military experts, representatives of the State Duma, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you end up running it?
Since I've been working in Libya since 2008, I was asked to lead the group's work.
Our activities were not limited to the liberation of the sailors from the "Mechanics of Chebotarev".
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main factions that are opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Sarraj is based. - "K" -), and from Tobruk (the parliament residence that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "K").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "Ъ"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
So we decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify the key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize: in Libya we do not want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are in Libya on a permanent basis?
There are five people in the contact group now.
Some of them have experience in law enforcement, including the Department of Defense.
We also want to bring in a group of regional experts, representatives from the Middle East Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
None of our staff are in Libya permanently, there's no need for that yet.
Are there any Russian military advisors, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and publicity about it is not true.
But your contact group is made up of ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we visit hot spots.
Or the cities that were closed to us until a certain point, like Misrata (where militia units based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and became noticeably active in the following years. - "Kommersant").
We arrived in Misurata in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that it was all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are rumors, what is the real role of Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the "Islamic State" - "Ъ" banned in Russia).
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, check the information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who claimed the credit.
And what conclusion did you reach?
Haftar won the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do that.
Haftar was operating on another front, Benghazi.
And the IS in Sirte was fought by the Tripoli government.
And by the way, we invited the people who were running this counter-terrorism operation to Russia.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and Rosgvardiya.
You've been to all the regions of Libya, we understand, and you probably have an idea of the mood of the local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire, the elections, that were agreed by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarraj in Paris at the end of July, will be implemented?
Or will the treaties be broken, as has happened many times in the past, with fighting resuming, with the parties trying to take power alone?
The good news is that Sarge and Haftar have agreed to meet again, which was impossible not long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
As for the Russian position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe it.
We encountered this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar was boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that very day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurata, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people to come to us today".
But our job is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are engaging in dialogue with all the key players in the Libyan conflict.
You and Haftar have been in contact.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR make it easier to understand Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian he knows, very relative.
But the fact that he's been studying with us, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And not just him, by the way.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who studied in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they're drawn to Russia, they're somewhat nostalgic for Russia.
Do you think it is likely that the arms embargo on Libya will be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan contacts interested in Russian weapons supplies?
Yes, of course, but as I said, we are not taking sides in this conflict and we do not wish to arm one side against the other.
We'd like to see everyone in a more or less equal position.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyan side for Russia to somehow facilitate its lifting.
Now Libya is actively moving towards the process of drafting a constitution.
We hope that the parties will reach a compromise, an internal consensus.
Then there's the elections, which was discussed at the meeting between Sarraja and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate government is finally elected (and currently neither side has such a status), the UN Security Council can be asked to lift the arms embargo.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned by its EU allies.
Could Moscow in this situation help Italian partners by using its ties to the Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar's troops will take control of the coast and end the smuggling business that transports immigrants to Europe?
That's a very timely question.
We're working on it.
The Italians need Russian support because Moscow is in dialogue with Haftar, with Saraj, with Misurata and with the south of the country.
And the tribes in southern Libya are playing a big role in this, and they are willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is this about the southerners stopping the flow of migrants at the far reaches?
So, basically, they were turning back the buses that were carrying Nigerian migrants?
We're working on it.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help bring the southerners together in a negotiation process between Sarj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first we'd like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Sarajem.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Sarraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of the norms of the Sharia in the country.
How radical is his view?
Would that be a barrier to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give you my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself maintains that Libya should be a perfectly normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get such a reputation?
It was created by countries that are not interested in Russia's interaction with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, the seat of the legislative, executive and judicial powers.
There's the national oil corporation, the national bank and other government agencies.
Of course, some countries had an interest in keeping us out of it.
And we've been playing them all over the map and actively communicating with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we're already seeing the fruits of this work: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
The director of the NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, made a deal, is himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil was made by Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess that's a sell-off.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
He plans to re-sign the contracts made under Muammar Gaddafi.
This includes previous agreements in the transport sector (railway construction), energy sector (electrification) and a number of other areas.
Do the Libyans have enough to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like the Iran deal, this is an oil-for-services deal?
I don't know what the pattern is, because I'm not directly involved in these issues.
Actually, the economy is not the most important thing for Russia in Libya.
We're basically doing peacekeeping work there.
Our main objective is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to reach an agreement with each other, so that they can establish order in their own country and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and to push the terrorists out of there.
Do you have any information on the presence in Libya (now or previously) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date there are no Russians or other former Soviet citizens there.
He said he had about 50 thousand phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Ъ") and Russian speech does not sound there.
What country are these fighters from?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Then let's put it this way.
How many Libyan Islamist militants are Libyans themselves?
There are hardly any Libyans among them, less than 5%.
The rest are just newbies.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan negotiations following the example of Paris?
There are plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have expressed their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can we have these talks?
It's hard to tell right now.
There are still a few visits to be made, and then I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of the talks.
In the Czech Museum , benefactors have collected money for a expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Melikhovo Museum-Reserve near Moscow, nine-year-old Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, cerebral hydrocephaly and complete blindness, will receive a special treadmill on August 5.
The useful present will be handed over to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not tire of doing good", which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in the Chekhovsky district: "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter".
"I would love to get a treadmill as a gift, so my legs would get stronger, and I could learn to walk a little bit".
Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation, the museum-reserve will hold a "Concert-post-scriptum" - famous pianist, the honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davyda Desert, the bell-blowers of the Ilya Drozdyhin workshop, the students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P. I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesin, the artists of the Melikhov theater "Czechoslovak Studio" performed.
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair was organized and a charitable sale of souvenir products with the logo of the marathon.
The museum-reserve "Melihovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk in the Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium fired several shots at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, told "FACT" in the department of communication of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a nearby café.
He had a conflict in the building, in which a man used a rubber bullet firing device, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has been given the necessary medical attention, and his life is not in danger.
Police and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the shooter had already fled.
The police identified him and arrested him on August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has a rubber bullet firing device that's been sent for examination.
The criminal proceedings were initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces a prison sentence of three to seven years.
We will remind, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28 there was a shooting attack.
The sentencing of Michelle Carter for the messages that incited Conrad Roy to suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said both she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing with her hands clenched and her eyes down.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
"She cut his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But attorney Carter said it was "a tragic incident that she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity, or even mental illness did not significantly influence her actions".
The prosecutor read the statement of Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, which stated: "Not a day has gone by that I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm doing - I'm trying to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever", it says.
Roy's sister Camden Roy said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become an aunt to his children.
"To lose someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life", she said.
This case is likely to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would hold a person responsible for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case gained national attention when it was revealed that he had been driven to suicide by Carter's messages.
"You can hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself I don't know there are many ways", she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on vacation with his family.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad", and "You only need to turn on the lighter, and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and he banned her from talking to the press to stop her getting what she wanted.
Lawyers are divided on the issue.
One of the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of the murder of her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, published a special opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison".
Evgeny Bogatchev: "I let go of Langford like a bird in flight"
One of the best basketball players in the United League of VTB 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender was commented by the president of UNICS Yevgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, - said Eugene Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go up against him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different treatment.
He played three seasons for UNIX and in every match he showed a high level, he gave himself 100%.
So I let him go, like a bird in flight.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and in his playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015/16 Unified League.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second time since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, Eurohoops reports.
The American is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second star of the Euroleague in July, which moves to the Chinese championship.
Previously, Yanis Burussis, former center of Panathinaikos, moved to the Chinese CBA.
A tourist from the Moscow region who had been burned by the sun was evacuated by helicopter to Adygea
Adygei rescuers today evacuated by helicopter from the mountainous region of the republic a tourist near Moscow, who received strong sunburn.
The man was staying at the Fisht Shelter, at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and was having difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a severe allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group told the rescuers that the man had suffered burns on the trip.
Audi to modify up to 850 000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement, Audi had said it would offer updates to more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions, referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon dioxide regulations.
But the nitrous oxide that is emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment to neutralize the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German carmakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of playing favorites with powerful carmakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of "Foxwagon", which concealed the use of so-called "damage devices" that could adjust the emissions during testing to comply with regulations, and would fail in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been convicted, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacchio Giovanni Pammio, is Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen, the luxury car maker that is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's revenue.
A cafe visitor in Astrahan paid with fake money
The police received a report from a bank employee about the discovery of suspicious bills worth 5 thousand rubles when counting money from the public food point.
A study conducted at the Criminal Investigation Center showed that it was a fake.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in Astrakhan region, one of the cafe's customers who bought the shaurma was paid with the banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police are determined to be involved in the manufacture and sale of a deliberately forged ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years and a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be attentive when making financial transactions; employees of trade facilities are recommended to install devices to check the authenticity of the received money.
Astronomers have found a hellish planet that can melt even iron
When astronomers first studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, they were surprised by its temperature, which is capable of vaporizing iron and other metals.
The researchers noted that the water molecules are heated by the starlight to the point that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: the high temperature causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared.
WASP-121b is a hot Jupiter, a gas giant comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to its parent star.
This makes the year on the exoplanet only 1.3 Earth days long, and its gas shell is heated to nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has been made to grow less well by the arid weather and disease-carrying insects; this has been a constant headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chess, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, says: "The lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years the plant has been feeling the effects of climate change: there has been a lot less rain in spring and especially in autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
And then there are the little cicadas, jumping on the leaves, the insects carrying the micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they become very numerous".
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender is not only a popular holiday oil; lavender oil is also used in perfumes and cosmetics.
Says Eric Schess: "Instead of very long stems with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
So we have fewer parts that contain essential oils".
Solutions being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective clay-water mixture and growing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 met with the students of Krasnoyarsk
Two-time world champion in hockey, ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met on the eve of the hockey players and gave autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of a thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Anyone visiting the tent could skate on the artificial ice.
In addition, there were organized relay races, quizzes and games with the playing of souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation.
Fifty schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the children to practice as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing in the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to play hockey.
"It's great that there is a platform in Krasnoyarsk, such as the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams", said the champion.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 are helping to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among the Krasnoyarsk people.
The Universiade tent will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Winter Universiade-2019 Directorate.
The State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
The official representative of the US State Department, Heather Naught, commenting on the briefing of the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said that it was necessary to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
She said such areas should be found to "improve bilateral interaction".
An example of such successful cooperation is the Syrian Armistice Agreement, Nauert said.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people all over the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other", the diplomat said.
Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev's assertion that Russia and the United States are engaged in a full-blown trade war.
"If Russia said that, then of course it has the right to say that, but I can't say anything more on that", the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war against Moscow, putting an end to hopes for improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the US sanctions will last for decades.
Furthermore, the Prime Minister believes the US establishment has "clearly outmaneuvered" Trump.
The bodybuilder who disappeared in Moscow was found in a strange country house for the amnesiac
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very acrimonious circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, friends and local residents searched for him, but without success.
And found Shamil in someone else's country house in Ramensky.
He was found naked in his bathroom by the owner.
The Daghestan athlete was unable to explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
His missing persons report helped establish his identity.
The doctors who arrived by phone reported that Khanmetov had partial memory loss and a craniocerebral injury, according to Mash.
There are probably other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The thugs who abducted Shamil had probably already been to his apartment, from which his keys were also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The actual oil and gas revenues in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Russian Ministry of Finance.
The increase, the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the estimate, as well as the fact that the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil products exports exceeded the forecast levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, corresponding to the Federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected at +40,2 billion rubles", - said in the message of the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated to the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at the organized Moscow Exchange's trading throughout the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the Federal Treasury accounts in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores the increasingly dangerous situation in Mexico.
The staff of the weekly newspaper "Ríos" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa, whether related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing drug war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to discuss security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists were discussing what seemed safer: taking the children to the office, which had already been hit by a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no proof needed, suspicion and gut feelings would suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of thugs who make it dangerous to report on the chaos in Mexico.
Violence is rampant, and the number of dead bodies in the country is growing: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people have been placed under federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least seven people have been killed in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of "Rio de Janeiro" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent crime related to drugs.
His absence is felt very strongly, though his presence is ubiquitous - a large photograph of Valdés showing his middle finger, with the words "Justice" written on it, hangs on the facade of the Rios building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smile, his face in glasses or his signature Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; the journalists discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, their paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to investigate journalist cases, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of drug-related and organized crime-related murders that occur every year, the killers of journalists rarely face justice.
Riodosa journalists insist they will report on the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated, even though it is much more dangerous out there.
Without information about the killers, without justice, talking about security at meetings is of little use", says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste time on this seminar", he says.
"Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodosa office in the state capital of Culiacán.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's title - which means "Twelve River".
The shooter drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around Culiacan.
But almost no one knows about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the US last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival factions battle to fill the vacuum.
Not to mention that one or more people are murdered every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate two-story mausoleums of drug lords that outnumber the homes of many living people.
Forget for a minute that the state of "quiet" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes into the US.
Despite this, and the fact that Valdes knew full well the dangers of his job, Ismael Bohorques, the 60-year-old co-founder and CEO of Riodos, is overwhelmed by guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the cartel's rival factions, which is at war with the sons of Guzman, was published in February.
The publication could anger the sons; people who were supposedly members of the gang bought all the copies as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn't force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that covered the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was hailed as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of harm's way for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd be here forever.
He was a veteran reporter at Norroeste and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded Ríos, selling off their $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on drugs", said Bohorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, with sales and advertising revenues growing.
Journalists were attracted to the idea that they could publish stories that were bold and uncensored, and readers were attracted to the idea that they could read things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose won the prestigious Maria Moors Cobo Prize for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it led.
He was honest about being afraid.
"I want to live", he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompoviento TV.
"You have to take the job that comes your way as a journalist - either that or you're just being a fool".
I don't want people to ask me, "What were you doing when there was so much death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of Riodos misses Valdés, a joker who cursed like a shipping man, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on the order he had established.
He had to wear his hat all the time.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.
They ask, "Did he die for the sake of a single, established order?"
His death has also made them question their calculations about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you go into their wives, their kids, their legitimate businesses, and their underground drug airports.
"These things were beyond the pale", Bohorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a drive for self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Riodos editor Andres Villarreal, is that "the sense of smell can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens".
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The room where Riodos employees gathered for security training was suddenly off limits to cellphones: days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shade of a tree from the 104 degrees Celsius heat.
They were assigned by the state government to guard the Riodos office, which is housed in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Culicana.
Some reporters have jokingly asked if these officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, a team of reporters went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue, "Rhiodosse" will focus on three main themes.
It's the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had a disclosure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a gang-rape at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who had been abducted or how it had happened, so caution was needed when it came to writing about what everyone in the city knew: that this was the favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and the authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the entire past century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to report on previous incidents at the restaurant, including the escape of "El Chapo" Guzman's son from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdes' column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"We would have known what had happened before", says Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Today, all communication with our sources is cut off".
Valdes' office is now being used as a storage facility for posters and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, because the staff members have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took some posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office the next morning, dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacan state in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have begun to speak out, to organize protests and to write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls.
Director Bochórquez was in Washington that day, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murder for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to be given any more assignments to cover government activities, fearing that her anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and a society that is indifferent.
In his latest book, "Drug Journalism", he writes that reporters are not just killed by drug gangs; they are killed by politicians and security services that are in league with organized crime.
The Committee to Protect the Press, Article 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up", Ramirez says.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, presumably written by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my articles".
The computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some newspapers chose to close, like El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brich was murdered in March.
Others continue to hold on as "El Mania" of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front page editorial entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to look for danger on the streets.
And sometimes they get killed, as evidenced by the case of photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four other women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work are balanced between risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist", he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready to be printed, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk near the office, drinking beer, when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan have reportedly left 19 dead.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of letters from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they used their cell phones to upload news to the Riodos website.
The next day, I had to redo the first page.
Sirens went off nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bojorques checked the police officers guarding them to see if they were ready to defend.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of their newspaper's late founder, whose middle finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the staff of "Rhodoce" continued his work.
"How can you think of closing down", said Bohorquez, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out on the street to do a story?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
The researchers said the first fossil of an incredible rhino-sized creature, discovered by a Canadian miner, was so well preserved that experts called it "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even identify that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown and say that he had, in some way, a dark past.
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as "the best-preserved Tyrrhophorus ever found and one of the best examples of a dinosaur in the world".
This fossil is a recently discovered specimen of a Nodosaurus that lived in the middle Cretaceous, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good condition has astonished researchers who call it "really remarkable".
This herbivorous thyreophore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the find, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium Mine of the Sancor Company near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the surrounding breed and decided to look closer.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was underway to find the animal in the 2,500-foot-thick (11,100-kilogram) earthen floor.
Now that all the hard work is done, the finished product can be demonstrated.
"A slight snoring can make you believe it's sleeping", said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, where the creature is on display.
It will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved examples of a dinosaur The Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herbivorous creature, despite being shelled and resembling a walking tank, was apparently at considerable risk from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful-shell dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and it employed a defensive technique known as protective coloration, which many animals today also use.
This would have allowed it to blend in with its surroundings more quickly and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature, a member of the family Nodozaurs, was widely reported in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum's lab technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team members who spent over 7,000 hours on its painstaking excavation.
The extraordinary preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and armor plates on its body.
They found a protective coating, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the protective coloration is well-established, the discovery was a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur far exceeds the size of any currently living protective-colored animal.
It's possible that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloration - such as deer, zebra, or armadillo - are much smaller and more accessible to prey, suggesting that the Nodo had to fight hard to survive.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the Cretaceous predatory dinosaurs were", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur's scales also suggests that its skin must have been reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal, looking for clues about its life, including preserved digestive tracts, to determine what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was carried away to the sea, where it sank and lay backwards on the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely extended much farther inland than they do now.
"This is a truly remarkable Nodosaur, completely covered in its preserved scaled skin, yet fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal", said Brown.
As a result, the animal now looks almost exactly as it did in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to recreate it, just a slight squint and you can practically believe it's asleep.
The Cretaceous is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, the Thyreophora may have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
Among them is the acrocanthosaurus, a monster measuring 11 and a half meters long and weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose recent findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was carried away after death into the sea and mummified in an eel.
The entity was discovered by Sean Funk while working in the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
Museum officials report that this is the best-preserved thyroid in the world, along with the skin and shell, and it's intact, from the snout to the femur.
These creatures averaged about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their distinctive feature was two twenty-inch spines protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyreophore struggled to cross what is now Canada until a flooded river washed it out to sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its shell with precision down to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the greyish shell plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresco wrote in a National Geographic article, such a degree of safety is "as rare as winning the lottery".
The longer I look at it, the more amazing it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin are still covered by the wrinkled armor plates that line the animal's skull.
His right front leg is extended along the side, five toes on it are turned up.
I can count the scales on his feet.
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get into Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without any documentation to prove his identity or citizenship.
Polish publication Telewizja Republika reports Saakashvili's arrival and has posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start the speech in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the fallen politician learned while in the United States.
How he managed to make the transatlantic crossing without papers is unknown.
Earlier, former Governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the citizenship application was forged.
The politician emphasized that he had not filled out any questionnaires.
The investigation into the Weinsziher and Olkhovick cases has been extended until January .
The preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Evgeny Olhoviak, and the head of the T Plus energy holding, Boris Weinziher, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman court will hear the case to extend the defendant's house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the term of preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conducting investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation", - said the investigator.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed the leadership of Komi.
Their total value is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of ZAO "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vympelkom", handed over bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for establishing the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olhovych were detained, taken to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from investigation and was declared a federal wanted man.
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core.
Just the day after arriving in New York on a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb apartment, watching a Facebook video on her phone.
She ran into a post from someone from high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the middle of the street".
Noticing that no one else in her feed had posted this information, she was puzzled to close her Facebook and open her Twitter.
She had a lot of @TheePharoah posts on her feed.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted live about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body lying in the middle of the street, where it would lie for four hours.
"This is savagery", thought Ferrell.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She put the phone down and then later that night, she came back to the tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the siren and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a placard that said, "Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, raised the rifle and shouted: "I will kill you all... animals!"
"This is an unusual situation", Ferrell said at the time, "from my own recollection".
This is not the kind of murder we're used to seeing and which we might call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried.
She got a return ticket and flew home the next day.
Arriving at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both be heading to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years or so is the subject of a new documentary film, Whose Street?
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, from the perspective of people living in a community and filling the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flowery dress and a wreath of color, they recalled a conversation they had had countless times before that morning, "about the black experience and the black experience".
She remembers saying, "Remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong.
"I couldn't help myself", said Ferrell later.
What's happening today is the culmination of what's been happening before.
She needs to know it, to see it, to be educated by it.
She needs to not only be very well-versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their position and what we need to do to become free, to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she doesn't face obvious racism herself, she's no different than any other black girl.
I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice if I shielded her from that.
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, a site across the road from the police station that had become a sort of tent camp, as activists waited for reports of the eventual acquittal of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was making lunch packs.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrell's consciousness took on a new type of activism.
"My activism has changed completely since 9 August", she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the National Minority Health Student Association and was involved in food justice and health inequities in the black community.
I had no experience as an organizer.
It came on its own.
A few weeks later, at an evening screening, Ferrell met one of her co-directors, Saba'a Folayan.
Folayan said she and her chief cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Ferrare simply wanted to document the events.
Ferrell thought of the question, "Are you trying to document or are you trying to find a story that you can play on?"
This skepticism was fueled by the many people, often white, who came to the community with the goal of profiting from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don't get the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently".
Foley had already teamed up with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement sparked sympathy for the project among Ferrell and six other local residents with whom the Whose Streets? team stayed in touch in the years after Brown's murder.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or with us, it's about us speaking for ourselves", Davis said.
It was the most important thing to me how these people would be presented, because that's how I would be presented.
And while the project was not about focusing on Ferrell's experience at all, in an effort to show that the movement is not about a leader-saviour, but about how a community comes together, as Folayan said, she was the most open of the film's participants.
The resulting "Whose Streets?" reveals unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked", said Ferrell, laughing as she described the first time she saw the finished product.
But I realized that when you do this kind of work and you humanize black people, there has to be a certain level of vulnerability.
Furthermore, Ferrell's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media after the murder of black teenager Trevon Martin in 2012 - identify themselves as homosexual.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions are supporting this whole movement", says Ferrell. "And all because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black lesbian women have to carry all that burden.
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and many gay black women".
However, she insists that this is not a case of affirmative action, and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of her distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened this energy", she said.
On the other hand, it's no coincidence that she came to the forefront, because when you
You can feel her energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been without cameras, but there remain complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell's on probation for two and a half years for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home, simply: Bardaka.
She's still holding on to the language she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
Two Salvadoran players disqualified for biting US players
The El Salvador national team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long suspensions for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinal match of the North and Central American and Caribbean Confederation Cup (CONCACAF), the Salvadorans bit the American players.
The first was defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit Josey Altidor, the striker, and then pinched him in the chest.
Then, midfielder Seren, on a corner kick in his own court, bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was suspended for three matches, and Seren was suspended for six.
The game ended with a 2-0 victory for the Americans, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarities: an artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all of them faintly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborgh from cheek rubs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from Fort Leavenworth, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the infamous WikiLeaks leak of classified diplomatic cables.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Emergence of Similarity".
It's the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborough, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and prominent dissident whose sentence Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing with a computer program the DNA that Manning had obtained and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of the faces that people with this genome might have, Dewey-Harburg created a profound, though difficult to grasp, manifesto that focuses not only on the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly identified as a woman since her teenage years, was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six counts of violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie of Manning in a platinum-tinted wig, clearly feeling awkward at the wheel of a car; this is the photograph she came to be associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project "Visions of Strangers".
In it, she created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence like cigarettes and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might have looked like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new exhibition for the press.
Chelsea was not allowed to visit or be photographed at the time, so they contacted her and asked if she would like to have a portrait created from her DNA.
In an unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became friends by correspondence, and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Repressed Images", illustrated by Shoyle Canoung, which depicted how in the future the president would commute Chelsea's sentence so she could visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama did decide to release Manning just days after the book was published was a pleasant surprise after seven years of hard labor in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and powerful about the fact that this exhibition is opening just as Donald Trump is waging war on people who leak government secrets and inventing new ways to fuel the animosity on Twitter that he's supposed to be softening.
When Dewey-Harborough was asked about the coincidence of all this, she said, "Nothing happens by chance".
In the artist's statement, written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of the dot over the "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic segregation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of C, G, and A pencils.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist scientifically put it), Dewey-Harborough hoped to show how we are all remarkably similar, at least in our biological makeup.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Harborg, whose 2007 video work "False Memories" is also on display here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here".
The last part of the exhibition that fits in one room is the aforementioned comic book.
It shows Manning in King Kong style, standing over the U.S. Correctional Building with a speaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they win", it says.
"So never shut up".
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me", says the artist, greeting us from Philadelphia.
"I still get the chills when I talk about it".
Manning hasn't seen the exhibit in person -- as it was divinely portrayed in the comics -- but when she does, she'll be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacres, gathered like a crowd of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as is everything in the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning's height), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn in pencil.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people", says Dewey-Harborg of the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that had formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood for its liberation".
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is wanted by police on murder charges.
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee, who are being sought as suspects in a stabbing death in a Chicago luxury suite.
According to Cook County court records, warrants were issued Monday for the involuntary manslaughter of 42-year-old Wyndham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the records, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranello died after suffering multiple stab wounds.
The alert issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
Police got a call, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with multiple injuries.
Officials say Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene, and now detectives are investigating a death from knife wounds as a homicide, while police are intensifying their search for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the university's vice president for communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from the Northwestern campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation", Kabbadge said.
Warren is a senior fellow in the Oxford University financial affairs department.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been in contact with the UK police and are prepared to provide any assistance necessary to the US investigating authorities".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have their own idea of where they are, but our efforts to find them are intensifying", said Gullielmy.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The cops called the crime scene horrible.
Gulliemi said it was unclear whether the incident itself took place on July 27.
He said the CCTV confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were related", said Gullielmi.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued a statement to the guests, saying: "Police are currently working on a timeline for the incident, collecting information on the victim and investigating a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in the fulfillment of the requirements was passed, RUSADA was given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (the anti-doping agency of the United Kingdom).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for the restoration of the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA's work and was recently published on the website of this organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present a problem for Russia.
"All is declared, all will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA soon", he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list is that Russian anti-doping agencies must publicly acknowledge the findings of a WADA-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Speaking about the issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All the measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we will not acknowledge what was not".
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport on the same day, Smirnov acknowledged that there had been problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report without reservation", Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping controls in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Nigli said that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" toward resuming its work.
Fire extinguished in 79-story tower in Dubai
A massive fire that broke out in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow time).
Local authorities have reported that no one was injured in the incident.
During the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The cause of the accident is unknown.
Earlier it was reported that Dubai is burning 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: the pants that don't cover her underwear
The scandalous host of the reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova amazed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dancing in her underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, the new singer performed the song "It will be hot for us" in a duet with Nastya Kudry.
Both girls came on stage in provocative "buttocks", stitched in such a way that the singers' underwear was visible.
The pants were inscribed with the words Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported how the changes in the appearance of Buzova was commented by a specialist from one of Moscow's plastic surgery clinics.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO secretary general also criticized Russia for its role in Crimea and "destabilizing eastern Ukraine".
Stoltenberg said that dialogue with Russia is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that US-Russian relations were at a dangerously low point, and blamed the US Congress.
Ekaterinburg metro is learning a new way to pay
In October, the fare in the Ekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay with a bank card, said the general director of OAO "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "Oblast Gazette".
Our goal is to introduce the same system of payment for metro tickets for the 2018 World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and without queuing up", he said.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber.
E. Hermire wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"He was never consistent or objective", said Errett, who runs the San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she turned to third parties for help.
There's a new kind of HR startup that's emerging that helps companies figure out how their employees are doing.
By developing and licensing software that measures employee engagement, they allow companies to do express interviews, reach out to specific teams and demographics, offer employees anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and reach out directly to the board.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, where's Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glint, whose analytics software is used by companies to measure engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better understanding of what her employees think and feel after three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and surveys of specific teams, the product offers a company heat map and visually displays which departments have more complaints and which managers have lower approval ratings, allowing her to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control their workplace environment, or they will become another "Uber" who got caught up in a scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control is a lucrative business opportunity.
The financial technology-focused payments-speak-together.com estimates that the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a small surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid a decline in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has been making a splash in the customer base.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized employee opinion surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if it's a top manager, complaints go straight to the board.
"The court of public opinion has taken over the power of the inspectors", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company is found to be misbehaving or unethical, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Before, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look up the phone number or the email address of the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of legal at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues that were previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states  such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay  can be detected and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic, all-round understanding of the employee situation", said Vitraño, who heads the Ruby Tuesday network's risk management group.
And we protect our shareholders from employee lawsuits.
According to Queensland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen went bankrupt due to ethical violations in the Enron deal.
But it wasn't until social media became popular that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Before people started using technology to control their ethics, they used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has been embraced by venture capitalists who have backed both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Mola Capital, bringing the total capital of the company to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research demonstrates that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did in the past.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and that they are giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for a company, feel heard, and see the work they do as producing results, they are more likely to make the company a success", says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when the companies in their portfolio do well; companies do well when their employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's no surprise that they're finding support.
According to experts in workplace culture, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But that data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from employees, it can create the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or doesn't come at all, frustration can develop, and employees lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations", says Russell Rath, president of management consulting at Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
Because if you don't go all the way, the staff will wonder, "Did you really hear me?"
Do you care?
If you don't care, why shouldn't I?
According to Earrett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem using Glint.
And after gathering feedback from employees who were unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve the problems.
The company Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to retain employees more effectively in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people", said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
Asphalt is being laid in the Red Army Avenue in Barnaul
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the asphalt failures on the avenue of the Red Army.
The place where the holes appeared twice on the recently asphalted road (intersection with the street of the Youth), it was decided to "open".
The collapse of a small section of road near the tram tracks was caused by the ground being dug in the area of the ownerless, inoperable network.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee for road, infrastructure, transport and communication Ivan Garmat, a detailed survey will be carried out to investigate and eliminate the premises for the collapse.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the restoration of the shell of the ownerless communications and their concrete will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins are having to practice longer because the National Student Athletic Association canceled practice twice a day.
It's nearly 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of UCLA football players are lingering to chat on one side of the team's new training field on campus.
Some of them pulled their shirts down, exposing their backs, glowing with sweat after the stress of the first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these idle moments are a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer school will be sent back to their dorms after three hours of training to prepare for their final exams, and will return to the Wasserman Football Center for a 6:30 meeting the next morning.
Just before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "These guys are going to be in the meat grinder for the next three days".
The National Collegiate Athletic Association cancelling practice twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their workdays - at least until the end of exams on Friday.
So the first three practices of UCLA's team were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate their already busy schedule.
The side effect of not having two workouts a day has been more days with one workout, and the Bruins are moving the start of camp nearly a week from last year and are training during summer school for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 practices until August 20th, inclusive, before officially starting their first game of the season against Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even though it's added another item to the tight schedule.
"For three or four days we give them this huge load, it's a serious test", Mora said.
And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think when we live to see Saturday and we have more time, it's gonna be really great.
When camp is over, UCLA will make the practice closed; no easy task, as its fields are in direct sight of the adjacent parking lot and the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that have crossed the defensive net behind the goal.
The Bruins are supposed to be booking hotels starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms become available during the season, there could be a problem.
"We'll have a guard", said Mora.
This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger of suggesting that someone might rent a room, sit there and videotape a workout.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in the number 8 parking lot.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan.
All the victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All those injured in the St. Petersburg subway attack in April have been released from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Vice Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, reports "TV Center".
The explosion in the St. Petersburg metro occurred on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, including the performer.
Eleven people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, have been arrested in the criminal case.
We will remind, that the day before, the Rospotrebnadzor recommended to the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspected of being fake to independent experts and show their conclusions under original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification, and possibly show the fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also being debated in Europe after French voters were misled by fake posts ahead of the presidential election in May, and in Germany ahead of the September election, which saw the government announce plans to fine social media networks if they do not promptly remove hate-filled posts.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook said it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that had been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which posts are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share", wrote Facebook newsfeed manager Sara Sue in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "Related Articles" feature and work on other changes to the News Feed to address the fake news problem.
To create a comic novel: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle was featured in the music video "Squeeze", and in the '70s and '80s it served as a retreat for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years ago, from his comfortable hideaway in the valley of the River Beal in Kent, he watched the turbulent history around him, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire-haired man with a penchant for historical documents, to write a comic novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago", he enthuses.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand".
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells the stories of the families who lived in Scotney; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkewich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book by Rhodes to be based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories", a collection of materials from the British Library's archives; this project unexpectedly touched him to the core.
"I could have been disfigured by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a Jacobite double agent", he says.
"This is his fingerprint".
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those days, they lit fires for light.
And 300 years in the future, you feel like you're there, too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For a man so obsessed with old papers, to receive support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and to live in a castle for four months ("I've been there a little, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and looking at the estate's many treasures and antiques - such as the hyena heads on the walls or bottles that had been in the moat for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to the foresters, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
Then at night he would "drink whiskey and sit down to write".
The history of Scotney Castle is not well documented, as the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had just begun to process the archives, which he describes as "something that aristocrats have been dumping in the attic for centuries".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring", says Rhodes, "but there were two families fighting over this birch.
It happens, guys!"
In some of the stories, the castle becomes the starting point for a wider exploration of English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
"There is a reference to a rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called 'The Knights of the Houses of Kent and Sussex,'" says Rhodes.
"The peasant revolt had begun in these places, and I thought that a revolt was a suitable beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are strongly connected to the castle's history - for example, The Priest, which tells of a Jesuit priest who was kept by the Darrel family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by piling up the coffin with stones (this was discovered years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrelas were the Rhodes family's favorite of all the Scotney inhabitants: "The gentlemen seem to have been the perfect swindlers, always going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
"Darrel men have, for generations, "solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women, "who I imagine as a company of nice guys "who can take care of the heirs of large fortunes".
After completing her work at the castle, Rhodes looks for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, writing a graphic novel about Elamyanmäki, a place that was a sanatorium in the early 20th century, and then became forest again.
But Scotney remains a special place to him.
"I was sad to leave", he says.
"I felt like, 'Fuck, I need to get back to real life.'"
Fifteen of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Opening", seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
So the ex-Arab organizations will have at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a solution - all the banks that have announced their break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, who, by the way, according to the results of the last session and the most effective Duma committee leader and deputy by the number of drafted bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, in particular, which envisaged a new classification of banks depending on the size of the charter capital.
Then Garegin Tosunian, the president of the ARB, stated that, according to the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, seizing their clientele.
Among other claims, criticism was made of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunian, does not always justify the revocation of licenses from some banks, which, however, was objected by the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of the fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were in the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive to relations with the main regulator banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, stating disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare to join the Association "Russia", noting that "the efficiency of the work of the ARB is at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is actually not conducted".
It 's better for the depositors .
How will it end?
Let's start with the main question that arises when there is a small failure or conflict in or around the banking sector: depositors are safe, rather, the reliability of the banking system will be enhanced.
Headed by "Russia" Anatoly Aksakov, known for his meticulousness in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their customers, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the Central Bank's leadership is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of "regionals".
In terms of personnel and organization, there are obviously no major upheavals to be expected.
There is no doubt that the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this oldest banking community organisation, established in 1991, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the monetary circulation in general.
It cannot be said that the "Russia" association is ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe, too much will want"), who on July 21 at a press briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day, representatives of banks that came out of the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia".
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll find out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, emphasizing that "the chair is not holding", called the possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia".
Entry of petrol cars to major cities will be unrestricted
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with petrol engines in large cities of Russia will not be limited yet.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is to gradually raise the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, what year?
It's like a slogan, let's ban it.
Where and when?
- What about tomorrow?
Shut down the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe it will happen", Prime quotes the minister as saying.
Earlier, the newspaper Izvestia reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by the general director of PАО KamAZ Sergey Kogokin.
Among the proposals, the newspaper reports, is the use of air-conditioned cars in large cities and on the resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for green cards.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has announced that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, which will change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan calls for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on temporary work visas and limits on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
This bill would reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it would do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources to support themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should concern us.
Before we knew it, 2017 couldn't get any worse, a new report came out on the technological breakthroughs in sex robot manufacturing.
I know.
Sex robots are in the spotlight.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples, and the type of its nails.
"People are giggling about it, but companies are already sending them in large quantities to consumers, and we'll be seeing a lot more of them soon", Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and near-human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "tune" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the robot's fingernails.
But the fact that many robots have "personalities" that Stepford's Wife would seem very progressive to compare with is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become silicone-skinned robots.
For example, RealBotix robots allow users to customize the qualities of robots that they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities - for example, "Cold Farra" appears to be shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that matches yours perfectly", the True Companion website enthusiastically reports.
So she likes what you like, she doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be "in the mood"!
There are many concerns about the emergence of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most troubling is the image of a submissive woman, the association with rape that is caused by the possession of the Cold (read: resisting) Lighthouse.
Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men, on the True Companion website.
"If women (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the site says.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with submission as an optional extra.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture for now.
But what is communicated to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the age in which we live.
And many people are not evil or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights around the world are under threat, with a president in the White House who boasts about stalking women.
The scariest thing about The Handmaid's Tale is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the squinting eyes, but how realistic the vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical resemblance of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to feel like humans, to mimic the movements of the human body.
But it's their "character" that makes robots look like real women.
They can't break up with their partners or walk away from them.
They have no life, no biography, nothing that would suggest independence or anything else that would shatter the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukraine national team since 2013, will not be helping our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final of which starts on August 31.
This was reported by the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev in an interview with the BeBasket portal.
We tried to reach an agreement with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won't be able to come for family reasons.
We're going to the EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players", he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the national team of Ukraine took a record sixth place at the EuroBasket-2013 and for the first time got to the world championship in basketball, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the USA scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 picks and gave 5 passes.
Jeter has stopped playing for the national team of Ukraine since the departure of the head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The men's EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play its group matches in the Promised Land.
The team of Yevgeny Murzin will play five matches in Group B: against Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (September 3), Lithuania (September 5) and Israel (September 6).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and the Belarusians.
The great Trump feat?
Playing Mitt Romney seems pretty reasonable.
In the Trump era, it's become commonplace that the political disputes that have polarized the American electorate have broken up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns about how to deal with the horrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all so stressed out that we're about to burst.
Less is said about Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm writing this because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who's had a long run of Republican feuds in her family, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing with about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
After dinner, it's certainly good; but I can't help thinking that in the larger context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has reinforced the left, but the deforming effect of his rule could shift us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will no longer be amazed by his antics.
There is, however, a more dubious scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans who, against his standards, suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I found myself missing a lot of old-fashioned Mitt Romney craziness today - with a dog on the roof of his car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - and compared to Trump, both seem like very little evil.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his right mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we took the kids on a ride in Central Park -- the largest ride in the New York City Parks Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge and formidable, the glass-fibre images on the central drum - the grimacing clowns and the animals, hunched over, looking back in horror - are extremely ominous, and the music, strangely, is delightful.
So many familiar things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of the buildings are too old to inspire awe, and the reality of the city is not as dreamlike.
Thirty-five years later, I still remember the day I learned that the Swiss Cottage district was not really a Swiss chalet but a large roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still the unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, an eleven-year-old and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could rate the carousel, I'd give it an A, but luckily, no one asked me.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars before I passed the card through the terminal.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, plus the option to include a 15% discount on the price of the order at the counter.
Not only does this slow down neutral interaction, but it also requires you to bring a personal attitude to a situation that doesn't involve it.
The poor shop assistant at the department store smiled confusedly as I wearily reviewed my experience handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius has been moved from prison to hospital due to chest pains.
Pistorius is leaving prison for a second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat cuts on his wrists, which the prison authorities claim he suffered as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter after the prosecution appealed the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her multiple times through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistook his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecution has announced its intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year sentence of Pretorius, which it says is too lenient.
The Attorney General's Office said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal would be heard this year.
Praetorius could be sentenced to 15 years more if the prosecution succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of a journalist has been issued a non-disclosure notice by NTV .
The capital's law enforcement authorities have chosen a restraining order in the form of a non-displacement order for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvzvzzhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"In the framework of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Art. 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Battles") against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was chosen a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription on non-exit and appropriate behavior", - clarified Wolf.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast of the Air Force Day, a drunken man approached the correspondent and hit him in the face.
As it turned out, the hooligan had nothing to do with the BFD.
According to Razvojzhayov, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens detained in Greece for illegal tenting
According to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, two Bulgarian nationals were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were arrested in Sithonia, including two Bulgarian citizens, who had set up tents in an inappropriate place.
They were released the same day while the investigation was still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC that the Bulgarian citizens were then released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught parking in the wrong place.
The checks will be carried out throughout the season.
The Ministry says the court can fine you.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is sinking ever deeper into the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality", the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
This is the Foreign Ministry's reaction to Pence's comments about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcefully block the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West, or with Russia" and the lack of clarity of the thesis about the allegedly non-alternative accession of all of South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also reminded that it was the US that violated international law by using force to push Kosovo away from Serbia, thus creating another flashpoint.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop shaming Russia and its foreign policy, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests", the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
A paramedic was injured in an ambulance accident in Moscow.
The accident occurred in Moscow's Stupin, as a result of the collision of a foreign car with the ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today at about 08:10 Moscow time, a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupinovo, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned", the press service of the Moscow Region Ministry of Internal Affairs told TASS.
The police are on the scene, investigating the incident.
In the Odessa region, a woman dumped her newborn son at a construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the police department in Razdelny received a report from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors rushed to the scene of the accident and took the child to a medical facility", the Odessa National Police headquarters reported.
The medical examiner determined that the boy was born several hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a cord.
During the first-line operative-investigative measures, the identity of the woman was established as a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also established that the woman had three other minor children.
As noted in the headline, the family has not been in the sight of law enforcement before and has not been on a special account.
The police are currently investigating the circumstances and reasons that led to the woman's actions, and a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolayev threw her premature baby into a garbage chute.
Grigory Leps: "I am going to fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday this coming Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer spoke with the reporter of "Izvestia".
I remember when you had your "penny".
A special tent in the "Luzhniks", Gloria Heynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
I'm sure you were thinking about how you'd like to spend your next five years.
Did the dream come true?
Speaking of the profession, it was a lucky time.
I worked hard, toured the country three times, gave 120 to 130 concerts a year.
He's put out two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the same person I was 20 years ago.
You can't fool your biological clock.
It's getting harder to sing like I did in my 30s.
I'm still fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I think I'm getting on a different level with new people.
You're recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
Actually, we've already recorded it in my studio and we're sending it to LA for review.
It's called "Why Are You So Serious?" after the song of the same name, which he co-wrote with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it out yet.
We'll do it later when we get the video.
And we'll release the album in November, in conjunction with my anniversary concert series at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow.
Your new record is being mixed by the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
You were thinking of bringing him on your tour too?
I think Coleman is one of the greatest drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, he recorded his parts.
I asked him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer who participates in different projects. - "Izvestia") asked.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about a fee of €35,000 to €45,000 a month.
Then I thought that I could find some good musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It 's better to feed your own .
I want to get laid every once in a while, not for nothing.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
He's written about in Western music magazines, he's been invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after hearing him play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different playing technique".
Your album is being recorded in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the US?
Are you trying to get that ban lifted?
I'm not doing anything right now, to be honest.
There are a number of lawyers who are working on this.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I've told you many times that I'm a student there.
The more you hang out with real pros, the more useful it is.
We're not as dumb as them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our pop music artists have never had the problems that American musicians have always had in 70 years.
They were striving for the highest possible sound quality.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason, the UK has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to apply for a visa every year at the British Embassy to be allowed to go there again and, most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco in August, not a concert, but a concert, right?
Yes, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, I've performed there once before.
Now they've invited me back, and as far as I know, the concert is sold out.
Will you go to the Lyma Vaikule Rendezvous, which starts on July 20th in Jurmala?
She invited me, and I, of course, accepted.
Lime is a wonderful singer and a magnificent woman, who can give herself with a beautiful voice and even a whisper.
After the tour and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You've already got two albums of his songs in your catalog.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs by Vysotsky in about the same way he did.
Just voice and guitar.
No other arrangements.
Accompanying me will be our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to get Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I've been talking to him about it, and we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You've been slowly adding Boris Grebenschikov's songs to your repertoire.
Maybe you could put an album of his stuff together later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a magnificent musician.
I've crossed paths with him several times and asked if I could sing one of his songs.
He would say, "Gregory, I write songs to be performed".
Please, try it, sing it.
It must be fun to make an album like that.
I don't have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do such a project.
If you don't concentrate on the affairs of your production house.
I guess you haven't realized his potential yet, signed all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I wish I had under my wing, but they're independent, self-made people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Sireja is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with some of his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now is Alexander Panayotov, who I coached in The Voice.
We have a contract with him and we're working.
In our pop music, singers like that are rare.
It would be a pity if he didn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, making videos.
I hope it works out.
I also try to promote other artists from my center, buying them songs, paying the poets, sometimes their tracks are on the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they don't reach great heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a record album, a couple of music videos.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I'm not going to insist that they get their money back.
Although I would be happy if one of them could make a commercial success of it and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna cut off anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, break through, prove themselves, like I once did.
If you were offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guaranteed entry, would you go?
I'm still getting invited to it.
Most of the events are closed.
And as for the big tour...
I am a citizen of my country, a Russian, who, by his own choice, flew to Syria on the very plane that crashed.
If they tell me tomorrow that I have to go somewhere else for the good of the country, I will.
And I don't care what the bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has happened with Ukraine.
Because I believe we are one people and should be together.
I'm afraid that's not likely, at least not anytime soon.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met the best way.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Svetaya Loboda, Artem Loik ...
Ukraine has a lot of talented people, and it is a pity that they cannot fully showcase their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should bring people together and entertain them.
I would be happy to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and do a joint concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Okhlopkov was dropped from the spaceport .
As it became known to "Ъ", the technical director of the Eastern cosmodrome Andrei Ohlopkov started working at the State Space Research and Production Center (GKNPC) named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Eastern spaceport, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Center for the Exploitation of Terrestrial and Space Infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Filhi, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Oklopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functional will be spread across the CNEIC divisions.
The fact that the technical director of the Eastern and deputy general director of the CENKI for technological development Andrey Ohlopkov moved to work in the Hrunitschev State Nuclear Power Center, "Kommersant" told top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He's been working in his new position for several weeks", said industry sources.
We were unable to obtain an operational comment from the CENIC on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was unavailable for comment.
However, the information of "Ъ" was officially confirmed by the GKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of director for the coordination of production, - said at the enterprise. - Andrei Ohlopkov has fully fulfilled the task set before him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work in the CENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular on Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his filing, regional merchants received state orders for the withdrawal, but did not fulfill the obligations taken to clean up the separated parts of the rocket carriers in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities he was given at the CENKI for technological development extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, who was then head of the Federal Space Agency, told "Kommersant" that the situation in the East "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact is that a strategic error was made in the planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To complete the launch before the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadline was moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, the specialists of the CENKI began to conduct the parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished objects.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the risks and the delay (the Soyuz was launched on April 28, 2016 instead of December 2015), the idea was justified, says a source at the spaceport: "Otherwise, we would not have launched any missions from the Eastern, but would have been engaged in construction".
Vice-Premier Dmitry Rogozin, who oversaw the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "cosmic Susany", but it was he who almost always requested information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Ochlopkov remembered and straightforwardly: for example, in an interview with "Ъ" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) of the status of the sole executor in the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Specstroy?"
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, TsENKI has assumed the duties of a general contractor to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the planned start-up in the fourth quarter.
According to "Ъ", the reason for the transition of Mr. Ohlopkov to a new place of work was the disagreement with the leadership of the CENKI regarding the methods of completing the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of working with subcontracted organizations.
"It was decided that this would be the best for everyone", says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East Building.
A government official, in turn, called the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find a suitable replacement".
According to "Ъ", this will not be necessary: the position of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be distributed among the divisions of the CNE.
Music schools will have a dual-training program
In the future, students of music schools for children will be able to study two specialties at the same time.
According to Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this purpose, students can be re-educated in repetitive disciplines, and the issue of paying for the rest of the classes in the second specialty can be solved with the help of special grants, reports "RIA Novosti".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education", - said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Non-Children's Conversation" with the pupils of the Sirius Children's Center, a student Maria Andreyeva reported that she was forced to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory's Central Music School.
The girl said that she studied violin and piano and had awards in both competitions.
The head of state recognized her question as very urgent and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was arrested after climbing a wall on a skyscraper.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man named Kirill N. was arrested after climbing a wall to the roof of a high-rise building, reports El Universal.
The incident occurred in the country's capital, Mexico City.
With the help of two unknown men, the youth climbed over a ten-foot fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed one of its towers.
He didn't use any special equipment, safety or rope.
They've got a young man on the roof.
Department of Public Safety officers dropped him off in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They check to see if the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a high-altitude mountain has gone viral on the Internet.
Users have dubbed the young man "spider-man".
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate can help alleviate BPH.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help to alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the key amino acid protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the lead researcher, explained that the immune cells in the intestines keep harmful microbes from entering the body.
Cells that can trigger the inflammation are balanced by cells that can increase tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much distorted towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in their intestines have a tolerance cell.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to start these cells.
Professor Kolonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is part of the normal gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice ate, the more of these immune cells they had".
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Dr. Luisa Servantes-Barragans, studying a variety of immune cells that promote tolerance, discovered that one group of mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separate, did not.
She hypothesized that the difference might be caused by the microbiomes of the mouse gut - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mouse intestinal cells was sequenced, and they found six different kinds of bacteria that were present in the mice that had immune cells, but not in the mice that didn't have immune cells.
Mice that were raised in a sterile environment, that didn't have a good microbiome and didn't develop this type of immune cell, got L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the liquid - free of bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells have mutated into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan level was reduced by half, the number of cells also dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether L. reuteri's tryptophan byproducts promote cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found.
She says, "Perhaps we need to increase the growth of these cells, because they are the ones that control inflammation on the inside surface of the intestine.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population".
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United have hired a genius in Nemanja Matic.
Manchester United have signed manager Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho says, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40 million signing from Chelsea started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season game before UEFA Super Cup clash with Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed in the midfield, with players like Paul Pogba and Andrei Peris pushing ahead as they saw fit.
However, as Matić did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game and lasted just 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires some finishing work before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius is in the way he thinks - he thinks with football", said Mourinho.
We'll help him prepare sooner rather than later.
Just like Mathić, his fellow new players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium, as Mourinho began to form his main squad for the start of the following season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to sign three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results, signing three of the four players he would have liked to sign in the first place.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four", he added.
I'd be even happier if they gave me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me.
Former leaders of Lithuania's Social Democrats are persuading them to stay in the ruling coalition
The former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-premiers Algirdas Butkявиčus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Seimas from the social democrats Česlovac Jursenas appealed to their party colleagues to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliamentary Gazette reported, due to friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and the Greens - the Social Democratic Party initiated a debate on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And three senior experienced comrades addressed an open letter to their party members, in which, in particular, it is stated: "It is understandable that the party comrades are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the 'peasants' has created for us, although not very easy, conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are provided for in the government program, and for the preservation of the political dominance of the left center over the right-wing parties".
According to former party leaders, the debate has so far been "a dominated by emotion-based expression of opinion without concrete arguments".
The authors of the letter fear that their party's ill-advised actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
Moscow City Court reduced the sentence of a wheelchair-invalid Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevo court, the convict was released from the SIZO.
The Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and the kidnapping of the motor scooter of a former special forces soldier.
Moscow City Court reduced the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility", - explained to "Kommersant" press-secretary of the Moscow City Court Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamaev's health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Russian Criminal Code, which allows for a punishment below the lower limit.
As for the assistant of Mamayev, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would have been grounds for changing the severity of the offence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be an acquittal, and I intend to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appeals against the verdict in the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights", he told RIA Novosti.
Recall that 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case last fall.
The invalid claims that he bought a motorcycle from acquaintances for 160 thousand rubles, to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces soldier, claimed that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov had taken their property by threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky district court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years of imprisonment with serving of the punishment in the general regime colony (according to part 2 of article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in the detention center, the Public Chamber, the General Prosecutor's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under President Tatyan Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from the detention center by the decision of the same Timiryazevo court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
The ONF will prepare a report on ecology for the president
The final "Action Forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told "Izvestii" and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, after the forum, the "front men" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of "Izvestia" in the National Democratic Front note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analysis" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding is not yet determined - as a rule, it is built according to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in each of two federal districts - Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that were and will be made at these events, we will form systematic proposals to solve environmental problems, - told "Izvesti" an interlocutor in the UNF.
The co-chairman of the Central Staff of the movement, Olga Timofeyeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "front men" would report to the head of state on the work carried out within the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF Action Forum will likely be combined.
In one year, we've grown into a powerful team of environmental experts, identified loopholes in the law, and stopped dozens of lawsuits.
All of this will be in the report we're preparing for the president as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "front-line workers" report on the work on priority projects of the National Defense Fund, - told "Izvesti" Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state for nature protection, ecology and transport, Sergey Ivanov, will also be invited to the forum.
Earlier, he had already taken part in the UNF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of the Environment will be history, and the most important thing to do today is to get the environmental mechanisms working for many years to come.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Head of the laboratory of regional policy of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrey Kolyadin noted: raising environmental issues, the UNF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts proposed in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, - said "Izvestiya" Andrei Koliazhin.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be ruled out, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the UNF, regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, - added the expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "straight line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill has already been developed to ban open coal transshipment in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is created, the question lies in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
The decisions taken by the state must be clearly implemented, - the head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for All" Leonid Bochin believes.
Sergey Tsiplenkov, a member of the Human Rights Council and head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is needed to successfully solve environmental problems, and that there is little need for legislative efforts alone.
Once society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergei Tsiplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to break the trend that violating environmental legislation is an economically profitable solution for business.
British inventor implanted a microchip to enter homes and cars with a flick of the wrist
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter an office and even start a car with the mere flick of a finger.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now, through his company, BioTech, offers this service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal in Winchester, to make sure that the procedure was done in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones at a cost of £300 per lock.
A married father of one has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
A prop for the White House cost the taxpayer thousands of dollars.
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American manufacturing cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-and-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 event at the White House to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials inspected tech products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the unit responsible for helicopter operations, the White House Military Office ordered the helicopter's presence in a private order, or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an unusual event.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusual media event", wrote the HMX-1 commander in an email to his superior, the Marine Corps' first deputy chief of air staff, the day before the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that same day.
The letter adds that if the White House departure is delayed, a second crew will be needed for the return flight in accordance with the hours of operation.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It's unclear from the records obtained by TIME whether a second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 asked if the event was in violation of this order.
"Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told that it was not", the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have anywhere to go", replied the deputy chief.
The Made in America event was declared an official event by the White House, and it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even formal events have political overtones.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote health care reform, which was then being worked on in the Senate, and praised the attempts to regulate governmental regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are supposed to use them for travel.
But to ask them for the sake of the photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of controversy in February when the presidential plane was passed in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is excited about the Made in America show, which showcased products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials", said Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to practice transporting the President of the United States to the White House with precision to the inch.
When Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight made for the "Made in America" event was counted against the crew's required training flights for the month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 extra hours that day as part of a "non-presidential support mission".
The White House says the taxpayers didn't pay for any of the other exhibits on display at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records indicate that the aircraft's flight time was 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims the actual cost of operating a helicopter is well below that rate.
"It is a total mistake to calculate the cost to taxpayers based on a rough recovery rate", says Walters.
These sample rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual appropriations.
According to a 2015 study by the RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things made in America this week", Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut take great pride in the fact that they're contributing to national security, and that there are, I'm guessing, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all very proud of this helicopter and all the other military hardware that so many Americans have worked so hard to create.
So, of course, it's perfectly appropriate to draw attention to it.
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed the Sikorsky company, joking with the press about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", the president said. "I have three of them".
Moscow will allocate grants for the intensive care units of city hospitals
The annual Life Saving Grants will be allocated to the resuscitation and intensive care units of the metropolitan health clinics.
The money will go to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named after Yudin.
During the clinic's inspection, he presented a letter of thanks to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protko, under whose leadership the most difficult operation was performed to reconstruct the teenager's foot.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants to resuscitation and intensive care units of city clinics every year.
The funds will be used to promote doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of Moscow, the clinical hospital named after Yudin is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new state-of-the-art equipment that allows its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna Rural Hospital.
The hospital's current capacity is over a thousand patients.
In addition to the intensive care unit and the hospital, there are day wards.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800.
The total area of the hospital is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year , the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term stay hospitals (SCP).
They're designed for relatively small operations.
The surgical procedures are performed with advanced medical equipment, which significantly reduces the time required for rehabilitation.
After surgery, they're only in the hospital for a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, clinical care at the clinical hospital was provided to 36,000 patients.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15,800 surgeries of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This was reported by TASS on Friday, August 4, citing a representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokopeni for the mediation of the mediated (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Sberbank was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU did not come", - noted in the message.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenya withdrew his application to purchase a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Gusselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of the Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by saying that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Saeed Guceriyev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriyev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
They are forbidden to withdraw funds from the country for the benefit of the mother organizations during the year.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on women's role in politics, the UN has said.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, participate, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections for provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban are threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to advisory roles.
This year's elections marked the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Hays said that empowering women would help democracy in Afghanistan succeed.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

Venice has tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venice authorities have increased the fines for bathing in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a swimsuit or with bare body will now be fined 200 euros.
Those who have a picnic in a public place or ride a bike through pedestrian areas will be charged 100 euros, TASS reports, citing the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
It also mentions that the authorities are imposing fines of 400 euros for inscriptions on monuments and 25 euros for trash.
Tourists will be informed about the need to respect the rules of Venice through a special campaign on social media, "Enjoy Respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia), as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, billboards and in places where tourists are most frequented.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice's Tourism Advisor Paola Mar, the fines will be sent to the embassies of the countries of the offenders, in order to warn their compatriots against similar mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach", she noted.
In April, the Italian city administration announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
Venice has already successfully limited the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to watch the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to visit the site.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
In the first half of 2017, the State Border Service detained 272 illegal immigrants at the border with the EU; a total of 1,059 illegal immigrants were detained.
This is reported by the State Border Service.

The SF has released Ozerov from the post of the head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Ozerov and released him from this position.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
The petition to remove him from office was written by Ozerov last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life".
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not a momentary one.
Since 1996, Viktor Ozerov has represented the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk Territory in the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation.
The Senate Committee on Defense and Security has been headed by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for Buryatia residents and producers
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities in the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to set fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial customers is reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On the introduction of changes to the Rules of the wholesale market of electrical energy and capacity and to the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electrical energy (capacity) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia in the subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers will be reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have been living on the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric stations on the Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main water collection territory for which is Buryatia.
And it's only this year that the movement has begun.
In March, the tariffs for electrical energy for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
Analysts say this is just the beginning, as the Irkutsk region's population pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt hour.
But no one dares to give even an approximate date for the new tariff moves towards lowering for Buryatia.
Scooter was not afraid of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
Legend of electronic dance music, the band Scooter flew to Crimea, not fearing threats from the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine.
"The flight was good, and tomorrow I will have a concert", RIA quotes the words of the frontman of the group H.P. Baxter.
Earlier, German newspaper Bild quoted Ukraine's deputy prosecutor general, Evgeny Yenin, as saying that musicians could face up to eight years in prison for visiting Crimea, which Kiev considers a temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter's performance at the Balaklava festival, which is called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is held by the company "Golden Balka" in honor of the International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous bands, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the festival guests will be Sergey Galanin and his group "SerGa", as well as Garik Sukhachev with "Brigada C".
The premiere of the new season of "Game of Thrones" will be held in the Moscow metro
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of Game of Thrones will take place in the capital's subway.
This is reported by the website "Komsomolskaya Pravda".
It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the "Night in the Metro" campaign.

The National Union of Skilled, Municipal and Boilermakers (NUSB) is concerned about the investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The union is demanding guarantees from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's in connection with its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland reports that the company has been silent about its future investment in the Tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs biscuits and Rich Tea, among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, says it has invested more than £5 million in the facility over the last few years.
The company adds that if there are any changes in the facility's operations, the employees and union representatives will be the first to know about them.
In a letter to the head of a company-owned facility, GMB Scotland demanded McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be released for the upgrade of production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility's general manager on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross".
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is large in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow area; it is a crucial pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the face of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in manufacturing, the East End of Glasgow is in desperate need of a boom in manufacturing at McVitie's.
According to a spokeswoman for Pladis, "The manager of the Tolcroix facility received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday, and the company will respond immediately as we value our continued cooperation with employees and union representatives".
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tolcross, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to our employees about how, like all companies, operating in the most competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly re-evaluating our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and lines of business - to remain competitive.
'In recent years we have invested over £5 million in our Tolcross facility, particularly in production lines and functional improvements.'
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a manufacturing facility, and in the event of any changes in operations at this facility, the employees and union representatives will be the first to know.
Putin says authorities won't give Rosneft and Gazprom instructions
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHC), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, nor to Rosneft.
This is how Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the conflict.
The head of state noted that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNHC puts the project implementation deadline at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom is offering to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we don't have such resources", Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked for permission to use gas from Gazprom's Kirynsky field located on the Sakhalin shelf for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that the negotiations on the issue were ongoing and that "there are no sharp corners".
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
The League member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop pursuing Neymar after the club offered £189 million in ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record heist that took place three years ago?
The sensational offer brought the summer transfer window to life as the League One club were poised to break the world record for transfer fees, more than doubling the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transfer is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of over £500,000 a week net.
Barcelona are known to be furious over how the offer was made and how Neymar ended his contract, despite a source close to the Catalan club's management insisting the club has always done everything possible for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of the PGA?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Mathewidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that would lure one of PSG's best players.
I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will come against them, we will make offers to their players, Al-Khelaifi stated.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences.
Barcelona seemingly crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let the Italian player leave the team under any circumstances, and Barcelona are now likely to feel the consequences of their offer in the form of losing one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin has ordered payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to sort out the financial assistance that is being given to residents affected by forest fires and for the construction of new housing.
I'd like to hear how things are going today.
Including the status of payments, compensation for the citizens affected.
I have some misunderstanding.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated", Putin said at a meeting with the heads of the regions located on Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve, which is a national nature reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the plenipotentiary of the Russian President in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menaylo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the Federal State Fisheries University, Leonid Mikhailyk.
They told me about the work on the lake.
The young were then shown in an open container near the container, where they were prepared for hatching.
First, Putin released a few of the boys from the pouch.
Then I pulled the special lever on the container lid and let the others go.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and another volume is supposedly provided.
"I want to sort this out, what, actually, is going on with our financing", the Russian leader stressed.
Recall that in the course of the forest fires of 2017, the fire engulfed the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, and destroyed houses and farm buildings.
In Ukraine, they offered to send Russians to prison for illegally crossing the border

In Russia, two new territories of advanced social and economic development will appear - "Abaza" and "Novotroytsk".
The relevant decrees of the Russian government will come into force today, August 4.
The boundaries and types of economic activity of the ROD in the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia are determined.
In the city, where 15 thousand people live, there will be a special legal regime for entrepreneurial activity, as well as a minimum amount of capital investments of residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is expected that this will attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investment to the city, and also create more than 600 new jobs.
The list of economic activities in which the TOR "Abaza" will operate a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity, for example, include plantation, livestock, food, soft drinks and clothing.
The Government of the Republic has already signed framework agreements on the implementation of 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the city-forming enterprise "Abakanskyi rudnik" LLC.
In January 2017, the regional authorities reported that Khakasia had fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of the TOR.
The authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novorossiysk, a territory of advanced socio-economic development will also be created.
This will diversify the economy of the monograd, reduce its dependence on the city-forming enterprise "Ural Steel" JSC, as well as create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities, which will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs in the new TRP, includes, in particular, freshwater fish farming, the production of feed, medicinal products and medical materials.
Noroick became the first of the monotonochors of the Orenburg region to receive the status of a TOR.
We will remind that the territory of advanced development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investment and improve the life of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the TOR can be distinguished the following: income tax in the amount of not more than 5% during the first five years, and not less than 10% during the next 5 years, social contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, use of the free customs zone regime, preferential regime of connection to various infrastructure facilities, as well as preferential rates on rent.
