Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and become the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
Among other things, he will be awarded a diploma, a medal and a check of $1.4 million for his outstanding efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and international cooperation.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian capital and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the Committee who selected him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in a solemn ceremony this afternoon when Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. President to receive the award, but only the third to be presented in the Committee's own chamber.
The White House has informed in advance that Obama will be talking about the war in Afghanistan at the awards ceremony.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he is receiving this award as a President who is currently waging a war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of 10 million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million euros).
He's planning to donate it to charity, but he hasn't decided yet which ones.
His program manager will then take him and his wife to a banquet that includes, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to pay that price at first.
For example, he mentioned feeling that we do not fully deserve it.
He also repeatedly said that this was not a price for himself alone but for all who uphold the same values.
He said that it was an "invitation to action" for him.
A nature advocate accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police charged the president of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Conservancy with blackmail.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and asked investors for money for his personal gain in return for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for Litoměřice police.
The President of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Conservationists is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague, anyone can sort their packaging of drinks, while in the villages of South Moravia you find sorting benches at every street corner.
What about Brno?
There, you'd have to take several minutes to find the right restraints.
I'm not saying we wouldn't sort out the garbage in Brno at all.
But I feel that the city councils in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of waste-treatment bins.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's a whole science, and it requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I found so far is Moravian Square opposite Potrefena Husa.
I don't think Mr Onderka and his colleagues like me, but I don't think it's very much.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a squirrel either.
So, in the end, a lot of my friends don't sort their waste.
Laziness.
It's a long way to the bathrooms.
I'm not surprised they're doing that.
I myself, after a party, offered to go throw some glass and PVC bottles.
Except I didn't see any colorful bin on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, there was a lot of garbage.
After all, it is the centre of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is likely that ecology and a supposed aestheticism are not of much interest to Brno's socialists.
They'd rather buy the city a spot in the top hockey league that's embarrassing the city across the country than buy a few extra benches and offer to sort out more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after spending a while on the Internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of all South Moravia.
Paroubek's budget has cut the pension and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or civil servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on government debt or international court proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on certain classes, they relied on the government's borrowing for sensible spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems off, minimizing the ground", said Janota.
It should be noted that interest on the loan is increasing and that it will have to be paid back sooner or later.
The government really has no choice where to get money.
If he does not reduce social assistance or expenditure, he will have to raise taxes.
To all those who have now been raised by the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then their children.
People will touch them and they don't have to worry about their pensions or their health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater state debt - next year there will be not 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus increase rapidly and with it the interest-related expenditure.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack 5 billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and begun sections of the project, which cannot be modified to reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or halting 30 major projects, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, warned Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw from the dividends of ČEZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which is largely owned by the State and will feed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were shipped from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts or to reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crime, and even the savings on housing, has decreased by nearly three billion.
It's not certain that the state can operate without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota says.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budgetary reserve.
The budget of the State Treasury is also missing, at a cost of two billion, which should allow the online tracking of the expenditure of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would be imposed, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another with the push of a button.
The plans that have been revealed look promising.
You just click a button and you're going from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the US company VMware, which is primarily concerned with the development of computer virtualization software.
We'll allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate between them personally and professionally
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It'll be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction at all.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which ran the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new mobile phone technologies is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the devices as of 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is a problem for hotel owners
Desert tracks are not a problem for the only climbers.
The lack of snow prevents people from booking skiing stays in hotels and boarding houses.
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visitors to our website.
Internet users search the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas", said Martin Jandura, operator of the news portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year in your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, you better not hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel owners in Špindler are currently offering only one week's New Year's holidays.
I think they'll try to place them for a while, but they'll give up too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will decrease rapidly", Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We're most interested in Christmas week right now, it's not completely sold out.
There's still room for, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last minute Christmas stays", said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer seats available.
The first fourteen days of February are just as good, with the remaining winter stays selling out in the middle.
This year, interest in winter stays was negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for it to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will be complete too", Schiefert thinks.
The occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou, on the other hand, is slightly higher than last year.
We've got an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last seats left for New Year's and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the January holidays for Poles and February is also selling well", says Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also full at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, when we already have 60 per cent occupancy at this time.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, interest in staying in the Krkonoše will certainly grow further, said Omnia Hotel's manager Erik Sporysch.
However, the hotel owners in the Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
It'll be cooler Thursday and if it rains, it should be snowing in the mountains.
But the weather will eventually warm up, reports Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It even becomes comical, the persistent effort by which Barack Obama, a president with a reputation for wisdom, replicates the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out he had copied it back to carbon paper from Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he repeatedly use the phrase "as in Iraq" in the text, but he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead".
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending reinforcements to a civil war-torn Iraq as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its aftermath".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was based on recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely success so far that the newspapers are currently not talking about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a far more favourable final situation than one could have hoped for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctance of the White House despite subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men so he could make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but for lack of a better option, he at least cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in getting the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted on 10,000.
What seems to be causing the most problems in all of Obama's strategy is his intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete the entire process within three years.
Many doubt that a halving increase will bring the same results as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is the exact opposite - no one can be trusted and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although officially established, will remain the powder in the eye behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity in the relations, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state of urgency", which is the basic aim of the operation, does not seem very real.
The timeline of Obama's strategy is perplexing because of his volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only got worse and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "quick return home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it an indirect admission of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving in the negative direction.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that could radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of resolving the problem through military force.
The answer will be, for example, when, according to Obama, America comes to terms with the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will lead to a dramatic change in the situation in Afghanistan.
The only thing that's stagnant on Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election and therefore there's still enough time left for him to come up with a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced the move in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The 30 senior leadership team will receive shares in exchange for money, which they will not be able to sell again until five years later.
The shares may be withdrawn from the management in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link remuneration to long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall direction to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion in premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would pay a one-time tax of fifty percent on bank bonuses exceeding £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
Five women, a record number, have received the Nobel Prize in technical and literary disciplines from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, there was the German-Romanian writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their compatriot Jack Szostak received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli woman Ada Jonath with American scientists Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't win this year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chips, which are now the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical glasses.
Each winner received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of acquisition of the monetary prize.
The total amount of the aid is SEK 10 million in each category (about EUR 1.1 million).
If one of the winners has several winners, they will share the prize among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since he was only at the beginning of his career and was also the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In his policy statement, he added that in some situations war is essential to peace, even if it is expensive.
Minister Janota is considering resigning, and Klaus invited him to the castle.
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is suspending his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Representatives.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He said the deficit was too high, which exacerbated the public finances crisis.
The meeting was reported by presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
The budget legislation, which will be signed by Klaus, says that the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
Nevertheless, the House on Wednesday approved the left's proposals on money transfers and increased salaries for civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the SDG, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by the Members, eliminates the package of austerity measures passed by the Fischer government and which he believes should reduce the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but does not require it, said today during a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irreconcilable deficit" of public finances.
He said there is no favorable solution now.
Only a strong government could bring about improvement if it could rely on a consensus of the larger political parties, the president said.
The SDG President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is appalling and that the government should question its future existence.
The Deputy Chairman of the SDG Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDG and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is appalling and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday the Czech Socialist Party declared the ratification of the State budget for next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invincible will reveal much about the country, its struggles and victories to the world.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman plays the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tirelessly fighting against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I'm gonna be you, I should be able to see you in person.
The 72-year-old actor who won an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's boxing-centric drama Million Dollar Baby, for example, played the leader of a movement against slavery that became itself a slave, a fictional US president, or even God in the movie Evan the Almighty but never someone as alive and important to so many as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in supporting the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country's president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning defeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela and the South African rugby team captain François Mandela's joint efforts to unite the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that sport can unite his people and he decides to unite rugby players who are among the world's outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in a way that brought him as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it's transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you were feeling, he said.
It's important to me to try and become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team that has a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby scene.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door, he opened it to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under director Eastwood received positive reviews and even talked about Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation by saying: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film".
In the ratings of films on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: Russians test a rocket
We could observe a strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the successful test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava either didn't fly or it got damaged in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers refer to Bulava as a "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th trial was initially normal.
It wasn't until the end of the flight that the plane was damaged again.
It was apparently the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, the "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving vessel and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was most likely caused by a faulty Bulava.
And the Norwegians didn't even doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we can't talk about failure at all.
The first two floors of the rocket held up, and the damage only hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines have suffered failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches were successful, the Ministry of Defence believes that only six out of 13 were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always claim that one day the Bulava will fly smoothly and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear weapons weighing a total of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years old
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will once again appear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend his CSKA Moscow team a helping hand in need and will probably make his debut in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is now the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is a regular coach and agrees to help the team.
We still have some details to sort out about the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by AP.
It was not specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback would involve only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who is able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played one full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
In the colors of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the latter part of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and canceled all overtime
The Hyundai factory management in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
The spokesman for Hyundai Vaněk confirmed this.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday to be worked again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, which is why volunteer overtime was offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz website reported that the company offered a 400 Czech kroner bonus to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the working day on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the extra hours or they can take a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their end-of-year holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will be compensated for transport and lunch costs.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot point in the comments and demands of unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees in the car factory were forced to work almost two hours overtime every day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions plan to cancel the strike after the agreement is signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is due to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike if their demands were agreed and a joint document signed.
The situation at the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers spontaneously went on strike because of the constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor wage conditions and alleged bribery.
The management defended itself by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements for automobile production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also called for workers who had stopped production not to be subject to any sanctions.
The unions are asking society to minimize overtime.
In addition, they want a reward of 5,000 crowns (about €209) for these.
The Hyundai automobile plant in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last November.
It had produced about 80,000 vehicles by September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "enduring" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, overtakes the fact that the combination does not have as strong an effect on the current variants of the virus as some drugs already available.
There is no cure for AIDS at this time.
However, patients can be dramatically extended their lives by a combination of medicines that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
In addition, suppressing this proliferation has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses that drugs no longer have any effect on.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, the Prague VŠCHT and the University of Heidelberg, paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metalocarbons are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than any other drug used so far and that's why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on virus proteins.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages with multiple walls are formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is an HIV protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV caused by HIV protease, there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
Stopping HIV protease will also stop the virus from spreading to the patient's body, the researchers said in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test cases and on resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the current version of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinical medicines, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current medicines are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to further explore in the direction of developing effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Structural Biology Laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
The budget debate, the SDGs, is on Fischer's side.
The President of the SDG (Democratic Civic Party) Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified for the following year "scary" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDG's statement a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
The SDG spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, SDG and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to take support from the House of Representatives for the minority concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDGs and the Social Democrats on the public deficit issue are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the 2010 budget, with amendments of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased the money allocated to the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The SDG left the House before the vote, following the government's wishes that a modified budget be a less bad alternative than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, and Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech TV, Janota made an appointment with the prime minister on Monday after he took office:
He also indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit such as those relating to health insurance, pensions or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: the ministers appointed by the SDG are not involved.
This is the business of the head of government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDGs have done nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are demanding TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public budget deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he should rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda I will be devoting myself to it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was elected to the government precisely by the Democrats, told reporters from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in this afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The SDGs have backed down at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas also pointed out that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday had it not explicitly asked the Democratic MEPs to allow the vote on the budget.
He said that the SDA had not been criticised by the Party Chairman in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I didn't notice my vote was missing.
I knew already when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevism of the House and the destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the ČD there will be fewer trains at the same rates.
The Czech Railways will, from 13 December, remove or limit some express or regional trains with less freight and strengthen others.
Total transport coverage will decrease by 2% from today on the day the new hours come into force.
Most fares will not change, including the basic and the reduced rates.
For example, the people of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the Prague-Písek-České Budějovice line, and the Prague-Letohrad direct line will be drastically reduced.
The greatest decrease in transport at regional level is in the Hradec Králové region, which is 8 per cent of the total, while Prague and its surrounding areas can see an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must switch to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, which is to be opened by completing the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The long-distance lines to the capital will end at Prague's main railway station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's bill for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways a total of 4 billion crowns next year to cover the visible losses, the same amount as this year.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The railways have just signed a ten-year contract, which until now was still a year.
The railways appreciate the system, which is also why they have not used a price increase on the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect one-day ČD Net and discounted eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the journey, whereas until then it was valid between cities in a chosen region and was a one-off fare of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels still holding more than 50 people, children released
Rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
The AFP news agency reported, but originally said only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, along with one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields when they fled from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find a deal for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence during a settlement between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines over a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's administration election were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern province of the Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
The island of Mindanao also has active Muslim separatists.
The authorities, however, resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa is a matter for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film is coming to US theaters in the next few days, titled Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells a part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to be his incarnation.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was given to Matt Damon.
With the film's release, the feedback from critics and audiences is heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, and he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has high hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is preparing for the World Cup, and the media is being shaken by disturbing news about the rise of racial conflict and discrimination against the inhabitants by the majority black in power.
According to the AP, the response to the new film is currently rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about leading roles where Hollywood stars "swim".
Morgan Freeman, however, in his own words, is proud of the film.
I've dreamed of this role for years and I've prepared well.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to get back his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film is based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin, the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman, in the film, tries to reconcile two racial groups from a long-divided population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he wears the South African national team's shirt on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the shirt lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela was long-ovated fourteen years ago by mainly white audiences and was recognized by white people.
Hopefully, the football championship will bring people together again as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only black member of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as recently stated in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A tens of millions of crowns worth of processor burning in the Louny area
A fire in the morning engulfed a Čeps company processor in the distribution centre near the town of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for the Ústí fire department, there are six fire brigades.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they changed their mind and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the entire transmission system.
Damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
Mandátova said the destroyed transformer would need to be replaced with a new one.
It adds that in 10 years of operation Čeps has not experienced anything like this and that incidents of this type are isolated.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, says Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, a spokeswoman for ČEZ in North Bohemia, and the operation of homes, government and industries was not affected by the fire at the processing plant.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission systems and power lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution points with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transport to the distribution units and 4339 km of line lines.
Jančura will file defamation complaint against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is today filing a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek from the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka from the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura reported this in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and claimed that we were making a fine mouth, when we were only making an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in return for the slander against the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
It also stated that it had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Mr Hašek considers Mr Jančura's complaint to be a continuation of his media show which serves him as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefectures to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura already announced last week that he would invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that would mention the unfavourable behaviour of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be aimed at corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway lines for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
He said that his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the ČSSD in Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumocoke vaccination will be free and optional
The pneumococcal vaccine will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices that say a mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are in full swing.
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance will pay.
The experts also have a clear view of the vaccination process.
A new shot.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't been vaccinated yet.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you'll have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child' s life.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet, parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of young children requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns a year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all the vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumocosis is the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections, including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 children under the age of 10 have died from pneumocoma infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions on a possible future vaccination requirement.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský Association said that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference our association attended, the experts were not really satisfied that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad we were able to impose at least this.
I think that is a direction to follow now, Kalovský said.
But the health department doesn't want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering this at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Doctors say that optional vaccination has its drawbacks.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination is flawed.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider reducing vaccination renewals. "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a large sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional", says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
The pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, who are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to get vaccines bought through insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some members of the House feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "depreciate health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance to pay them back.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns a month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum robbery"
Frank Frazetta's son, a noted illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
She said Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum by any means necessary to transport the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such a permit, the agency said.
Labour supports the increase in the budgetary tax.
Ministers have defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also attracted outrage by tackling low and average wages.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Security
Trade unions protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were looming.
The decline in Social Security - which will bring about about about GBP 3 billion a year - has angered the business world, as he believes it is a job tax while the goal should be to boost the economy.
The increase, which is reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINTS of the PREBUJET report
Social Security will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will decline even further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
Increased corporate income tax for small businesses has been abandoned
Tax reductions on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury's estimates, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 a year and a person earning £40,000 will lose £190, while a person earning £10,000 a year will earn an additional £110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was to lead to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the top 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms rejected the tax increase and said that a reduction in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to split the deficit in two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident and that the economy would resume growth by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will affect how much it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - were called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise his initial figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely decline by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be 3 billion more GDP than the previous estimate.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis", said the plan to borrow £789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - which are due in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do", said Philip Hammond, chief secretary to the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it".
"The important announcements will be made after the election, no matter who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory proposals which would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised from the tax increases and the decreased spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC's political editor, said the timetable for announcements - such as the inflation increase for some disability benefits in April next year, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, as the money would simply be recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional aid is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor's figures imply substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including possibly transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually just a delay", said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner", added Roger Bootle, Deloitte's economic adviser to accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of that".
FBI investigates "arrested Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American journalists suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are described as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are US citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are detained", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is the students who are truly missing", she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States should "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were taken away from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights have been less respected than ever in the last 20 years, according to Amnesty International's report.
The report presents 'repetitions of violations' by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man mentioned in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another claimed that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'working with Facebook networks' and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bloody and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others raped.
Iranian authorities have denied the allegations of rape, but have admitted that abuse has taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but it claimed that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an attempt to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow have been used to turn the Bristol site into a racetrack.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for prizes in kind.
Up on the Brandon Hill Park track, a small stepping stone led a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It's a beautiful view, with all the city lights shining down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent", he added.
Prizes were awarded to the best lights - or figures - on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be drawn to this new book, admirers of the author's latest work, "Why French People Don't Like Scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and concerned the country for about 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country now.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very good at listening and playing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or the town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their counterparts advocating a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which today constitutes a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But compromise can only be achieved through the efforts of each side.
He wonders how committed French politicians (and the intellectual elite who are so virulent guardians of secularism) are to pluralism.
He said that Muslims were not spoiled, compared with Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
After reading this book, you are tempted to say "yes, but not yet".
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than anywhere else on the planet.
The ice that makes up the ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", writer and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural history of the Great North's symbol, the polar bear.
A knowledgeable of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspirant who had only the tip of his musket to fight, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at a time.
Even today, a zoo is still usually one millionth the size of the area needed for a free adult. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green because of the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells stories from other writers and historians and often talks about the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorbike Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations are where ice will stay the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what the future might hold there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric nor oceanographers can accurately predict the speed of change.
It's not a lack of trying.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in relief below it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by hard-core men camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson looks at the extraordinary, tiny world of the Arctic ice system, formed by the seams of pressed, freezing salt water.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders of ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, which is projected to be between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it might be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on Arlington's graves
First class 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting the men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we are sent, we may be in their shoes, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the memorial and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities along the way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated over $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington to honor her late husband, a career military man.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the sprawling hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose old graves dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as frequently visited as the new tombs, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown was dark green in color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Nearby, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the gloomy mood of the current wars was filling the area.
Some people cried without hiding, others prayed, and family and friends supported each other in the cold.
Some read out the names engraved on the stone, while others leaned down to see the small black and white information cards, buried in the wet earth for those whose graves had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wept at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and had driven eight hours to collect at the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget what makes us free... my son paid for it, she said.
"A long time after I've been gone, I want someone to remember him".
A U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who distributed cell phones and laptops in the country, U.S. State Department officials said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges were not made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and is followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but has always been denied permission.
The detention of a US citizen may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government take concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the US can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desirable consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
Only this year did the Cuban government grant ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones, which are used primarily for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to report their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas Program at Human Rights Watch, who recently published a harsh report on liberties in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly plotting to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan with the aim of killing US troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who are roaming the Internet looking for young radicals.
Investigators claimed they were hunting a hidden insurgent figure known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving of the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, the men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not part of the CIA's plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered to be undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network a priority.
The organization's recruiters act as barricaders, refusing entry to those who show no serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
Analysts say the potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they're also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to be more and more careful in recent years when choosing whom they accept because US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many others have already followed?
The model is the one that's increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" on climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding greater climate action from negotiators working at the Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city center.
On this day when little was happening during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, placing placards in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, stating "The Earth says she's had enough".
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country because of the impact of the climate change that is already taking place".
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and call on world leaders to make just, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or possessing pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or possessing pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate talks, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were dropping them near buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Congress Palace, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought a protest would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event is important, I can't hear what's happening outside".
He noted that the march may seem harmful or beneficial depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors in the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others".
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week's federal math report brought good news to Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the main institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress show is the persistent gap between African-American and white achievement, both locally and nationally.
The average outcomes of white fourth-grade children (cm1) in Washington, D.C., have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (fourth) is generally consistent, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean result of the white people was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently large.
The overall view of a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) when the District's first NAEP report was published was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the school group's Director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), was being driven by white students who were already good element.
That would mean we've raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in the District's education.
I don't jump for a point or two", said Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. council member whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message from the test results was that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
You really always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what's scary is that we don't spend enough time and energy in our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils in the final grade and early college years who had not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school journey and were quite late in comparison with their peers.
Every day, the math program, for grades Kindergarten through 6th grade (grades 6 through 6th), focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former District Manager Clifford Janey, who also has to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think we need to keep working to provide better interventions to these lower-class students, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system performance while providing money and resources for less-performing schools to bridge the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education instructor at the University of California, Berkeley who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This targeting can also have political implications that hamper this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she's trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, can ensure that their children can get a good public education.
Janey, now the Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to be strong enough to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" for getting another raise in his next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks for a moment at the white columns, brick façades, and lush lawns.
Graciela's parents had only finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
So while she and other 8th-grade students in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, as the guide led them to the entrance to the Science Building.
Youpi, really? she said dreamy, when she was told the low student-to-teacher ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh place children visited on their three-day discovery journey and now they had completely integrated the message:
The question is where.
While this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to immigrant Hispanic parents who left high school and became parents as teenagers, hundreds of thousands are also benefiting from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five second-generation Hispanics is still in high school - a remarkable achievement considering that many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, and they pave the way for the next generations to play an important role in the country's labour force.
Researchers who study the school curriculum say that the curriculum is naturally linked to school and has an innate need for success.
Many parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are consistent and long-term.
When you look at children in low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to the universities in Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparatory programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through the end of high school years.
Since 1999, more than 10 million students have attended the program, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry gets deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the recovery of Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who put up an auction lost.
Two American companies won contracts for the auctioned fields in June.
The low representation of the US oil giants in the opening up of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news website.
It's going to be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdraw have slowed U.S. oil companies from entering more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
US companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and provided technical advice, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bid on contracts more than other companies and has left with significant holdings in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power", said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on a par with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to bid bid bid bids which were then compared to the barrel rate the ministry agreed to pay to justify production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a US missile, striking along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, counter-espionage US authorities said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US and Pakistani sources in the region.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired by a drone of the type used by the CIA, within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of the Pakistani civilian intelligence service said, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Authorities said the local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally dismembered bodies".
Local authorities were completely unable to verify the identities of the victims, but the two US counterterrorism officials provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as one of the military organizers of al-Qaeda who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize worldwide plots, said one of the authorities, who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistan.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second official from the US said Somalia had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
The second official said that the US public may not know about it, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies.
If confirmed, Somalia would be the second major al-Qaeda figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operatives.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has been declining since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a nonprofit group-moderated website.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have made progress to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informers, the website says.
UN special envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate marred by widespread corruption allegations during the UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply keep the commitment he made to his family in March, to only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it's better to start looking for a replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
The representatives said that Staffan di Mistura, an Italian-Swiss national who recently headed a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations, were named.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after her former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused her in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said Galbraith's allegations -- who was thanked -- "have hurt the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism about international election observation".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate U.S. aid to Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries than he is assigned to the Afghanistan mission, saying this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of her powers in Afghanistan, saying the UN's heavy hiring regulations were hampering her opportunities to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran needs to face further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in nuclear ambition talks.
Speaking before a bunker of 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a outcome. ̈
One of the things that's been bothering me the most is that if there's one thing I've learned in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has reported that some of those sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously" from such sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran would face "probable" consequences if it did not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment only for peaceful purposes.
At the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a substantial part of its enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts to reach a deal - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran's hardening of its mind on some of the proposals of the international community that they actually agreed to in early October has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in on what they had not considered, in terms of additional significant sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including continuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement on Thursday in New York, Iran's UN mission denounced what it called "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with the chiefs of staff in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delay in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal, with US authorities quoting Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you".
In an Aging China, a Change in Direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that taught them, "Mother Earth is too tired to have more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave".
They learned so well that authorities in the Shanghai government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate in their city and the aging population, changed their course dramatically this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was immediate and firm: never.
We've already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left", said Wang, 31, HR director and father of an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and bad cheeks, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate per couple has fallen by 1.8 children from six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a future shortage of labour".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries like Japan and Sweden", she said.
A gradual easing
The one-child policy, which was drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, is undoubtedly the most controversial one introduced by the Communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy risk paying huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend towards its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in implementing this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women to have a second child.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions, leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they gave more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research, Beijing University, said that central government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and to drag flyers to their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointing Response
Although officials in a rural town outside Shanghai say they have seen an increase in applications for couples wishing to have a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications a month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu Municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to feed their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the government life insurance.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wanted an only child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us".
We're not used to taking care of anyone else, and we really don't want to take care of anyone else".
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, says this more bitterly.
For middle-class couples working as two, who are lowering the birth rate, he says, it takes selfishness to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and they don't want to have that lifestyle for themselves, he says.
Even a single child asks for a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's the space issues -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you have to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergartens".
Most of his friends are ready for that experiment once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by so far disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back under fire on Friday, due to the release of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing the bulk of the burden in the coming days.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and provided guidance on the way forward.
But it was seen as a major step forward in the timeless negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by a UN task force, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what the upper limit of global warming would be that leaders would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a great deal of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the paper, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's executive secretary-general on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement whereby the industrialized nations collectively would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent in 2020 from 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also resumed negotiations on Friday, pledging $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change -- to cope with floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Representative for the Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of the major emerging economies, if not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top US negotiator was either "unreasonable" or "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the US would not financially help China fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were struggling to decide who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries became more aggressive in their attempt to hold the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It's really a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also a climate adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the actions of small island states have "put political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now unified and calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became a matter of urgency, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems before the heads of governments could reach agreement.
High-level officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend indoor meetings and briefings, so they could make claims that will be considered within the next week.
The real picture of the rally -- where 13,000 people come in and out of the Congress Palace every day -- guitar activists performing night shows mocking countries that they think betray each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the great", said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate into an international network of high-speed and reliable trains and will connect the major Midlands, Northern and Scottish towns and cities with London.
Small lost holes will become thriving suburbs, business travel times will be much shorter, and the passage of air and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties are in favour of this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable scheduling battle and fears of environmental hazards could put a brake on Britain's high-speed railways.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will hand over its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line between London and the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to have three options for a larger high-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
Preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems to be the best performance option", said a railroad professional.
When this is completed, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to accommodate trains of 400m in length and carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on the London-Birmingham line.
A terminal with a capacity of 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is envisaged that an existing station will be extended to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put into place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he starts the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to roll off high-speed lines on existing railways north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers repaying the £75,000 loan for the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a senior Tory MP, has asked the taxpayer to pay thousands of pounds a year to pay back the cost of an orange tree he built in his home in his constituency.
The party official who was relieved of his position by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "understood" raised his loan by £75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who monitors members' spending.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The houses nearby were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the grievance office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a "fun fair".
Mr Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the House of Commons concerning its previous borrowing arrangements.
The Committee acquitted him last month of all charges of non-compliance, after an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal security of the GBP 271,406 loan from his London property to the house in his constituency which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming around £1,400 a month in borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard variable interest rate RBS has increased from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, and has not changed since then.
The latest publication from the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost office in September after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live on a budget and you're treated like a "m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small share, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for a lot more, but I didn't".
The MP, a millionaire from his former position as an oil trader, began to have to explain his spending in May after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fee office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a pound-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed he had asked for 4,000 GBP for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the Office of Expenditure and Legg".
He added: "There is no problem with backtracking or making or using rules or anything.
It was very clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler".
Loyal ones, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar.
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages creative spiritual exploration, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. each day, with free pastries and hot wine served.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest in the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church expect people to enter an old strange building? I think the church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more exciting way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality".
Strong climate action in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on fighting global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police conducted several hundred interrogations.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, and 100,000 according to organizers, marched in the Danish capital in the cold, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is set to reach an agreement by Friday that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the climate conference, the growing global climate mobilization, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed entirely in black, smashed windows with marbles and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Riot police immediately intervened without mercy.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mostly members of the "Black Blocs", the ultraviolent groups that demonstrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", noting that about a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night" "handcuffed and kept in their seated positions despite the extreme cold".
Parliamentary party, the procession, rather good kid, took over the Bella Center, negotiating site.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter.
A stage was set for the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in rain-blind blue skies, had formed a first morning gathering in Copenhagen at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue waves" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand redress for the ecological debt to the South", said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot keep saying we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-world movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alter-worldism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no intersection between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had started protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators also took place to demand vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounced a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced it as a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first vote since the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
The turnout rate was 58% a few hours before closing, according to officials from the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, strongly reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
For its part, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia", said its spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this 216,000-strong territory, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After seceding from Georgia in the 1992-93 conflict, which killed thousands, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said 54-year-old historian Svetlana Kvartchia, who said she voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian dominance is at the heart of the presidential election in this region of lavish landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small 216,000-strong territory.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, welcomed Russian officials who had come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, especially the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Russian parliamentarian Alexei Ostrovski, holding up a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one giving control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands marched across the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, on the spot, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive protest.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, about a hundred thousand according to organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliamentary party, the procession, generally good child, took over the leadership of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without trying to enter.
A stage was set for the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the parade left, a group of a few hundred protesters, dressed entirely in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, reported an AFP reporter.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened ruthlessly, throwing many of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", the ultra-violent group that demonstrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was wounded in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We are watching the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the police helicopters were shooting into the sky.
Most of the protesters, who came by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in rain-blind blue skies, had formed a first morning gathering in Copenhagen at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue waves" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand redress for the ecological debt to the South", said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-world movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alter-worldism, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice" - "today there is no disconnect between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several figures, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had started protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas promoting solar power outside the city hall in the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred protesters also gathered to demand action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geographical history of the reform of the general secondary school is strengthened, according to Chatel
In an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday, National Education Minister Luc Chatel said that history and geography were "reinforced" by the reform of the general secondary school, despite the abolition of compulsory education in science terminals.
From now on, all first-year students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr Chatel.
The Minister said that "hypocrisy must be removed" because, according to him, "the S-field is no longer a scientific field" but "basically concentrates the best students".
The ES and L fields cannot remain sub-fields of the S, he continued, adding: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals angry about the absence of history-geography in the technical secondary schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish compulsory history-geography education in S-Class. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized the abolishment, as did some left-wing and right-wing elected officials.
The Minister, however, added that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also advocated reforms in teacher training, as 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass a qualification test at the beginning of the year that will test their discipline and then at the end of the year an admission test that will test their teaching ability, the minister explained.
They will also take on an apprenticeship during the M2 year and then be a first year in front of students as apprentices.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more student attendance, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister says that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the issues at stake at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge raised by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day of a series of 15-minute expert talks, each filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist said.
We wanted to do something that would capture people and make them want to know more, said Edward Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the day, who took his name from the one given by the students to the school's fish in the pool.
He said that about 20 speakers were selected from among the experts in their field and selected for their charismatic side.
"We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking without notes but using charts in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as scientists, he stressed, hoping that the audience will remember that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier'.
The videos of these lectures will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next day of "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Late payments: anger from prison guards, planned actions
The prison warden's unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand the payment by the end of the year of bonuses and overtime, which were delayed in January for budgetary reasons.
The FO-penitentiary (second union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities and to "block" them, to "report the theft of their duties".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union) called on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilisation", calling it "shameful and unacceptable" that the "overtime, night, Sunday and holiday premiums" worked in October were not paid in December.
And the first union of prison guards, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization . . . to spread discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prisons and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all of it was budgeted, but assure that the relics will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to implement a set of measures without delay to prevent this situation arising from a miscalculation in the number of overtime hours from happening again in the future, adds Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be small, except for executives who benefit from the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, the Ufap/Unsa lamented, for whom "budgetary constraints are a good thing".
This is a scandal, the interregional union FO Marseille said, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and conventions" until further notice.
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays unless those in October are regularised in December, including overtime, threatens the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take on staff's money, says the Bordeaux Penitentiary CGT.
The unions say that the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less well-functioning than others.
But the number is not there anyway, said the UFAF Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he offers "cooler tricks" than he gets
US President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told the small screen "dad" Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it came to gifts: "I give more cool stuff than I get".
In a special show on ABC Sunday night, the president and his wife, Michelle, give a glimpse of how they plan to celebrate the New Year's Eve in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the party.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" get a gift, according to pre-aired excerpts from the show.
And Michelle Obama has been falsely accusing her husband of the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year", she taunted the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before he jokingly replied by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, casual show, with the famous hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time I met my dad who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had all the furniture lined up against the wall, rather than putting it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-op, RTL says he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday underwent reopening in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL says the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opted Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "operational injuries" from the herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his Paris press service said, adding that the injuries "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, reassured that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical newsletter would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the singer's partner on the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was reportedly put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens his eye, RTL adds.
Interviewed by AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that 'according to some sources' no drainage was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had surgery at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the art world.
He was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for a subsequent infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close associate of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured that he would "don't worry" about the rocker, who is "a beat man".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing 12 hours of flying after such an operation is not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, reassured himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacts satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "anti-indicated".
Mr. Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling from his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of the general public, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for "a small colon cancer" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long tour "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulty moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospital stay.
Euro-2009/small pool: the first of Bousquet's fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time World 2009 medallist in the large-scale swimming, won an international title on Thursday in his favourite distance, the 50m freestyle swimming event at the Euro 2009 small-scale swimming event in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the last time the suits are allowed saw only three world records beaten while we waited for a break.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in the 200m 4s and the other two by Russia in the 4x50m 4s relay.
It is a pity for Bousquet, who held the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he holds in the long jump (20.94).
In one of the two reigning distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman set himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the lead against eight normally, a first at international level.
Bousquet outscored Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
You can always dream better, and on this occasion, I said that if I could hold the world record, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
Having created 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the suits did not serve the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the large pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower his 400m freestyle record (3:32.77) but nevertheless established himself by scoring his second career best time (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't really get into this race.
I knew I couldn't break a world record this time but I did manage to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola's sarcophagus panel awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus, owned by French writer Emile Zola, was sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above his estimate, said art dealer Sotheby's.
The two-meter-long, 63-centimeter-high, three-foot-tall front panel, dating from the third century C.E., was estimated to cost between $150,000 and $250,000.
"The marble, which depicts four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and ballads, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, Sotheby's vice president of Roman and Egyptian antiquities auctions, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one that buyers have been most bidding on so far, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble dates back a few days.
The panel remained for nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it part of her bathtub in her private Parisian hotel, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
There was a shadow area that had been there for about 50 years.
While digging through the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelaya's failed attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that the conditions for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were no longer met, who was refused a safe passage by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation with President Zelaya in the night, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not there, said Mexico's Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane has returned to its home country, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him a safe passage.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest acting head of state.
The coup government "failed again in wanting me to resign . . . they wanted me to resign", Mr. Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, where he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some chords the fallen president, a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the minister of interior of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum from any country", Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur channel.
He stressed that a possible departure from Honduras would have to be made as President of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This shows the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he is released, he will be arrested and charged with high treason, which the government says is a criminal offence.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing a recovery in both the US and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq gained 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, the main focus of the investors was on the US trade balance, "which shows that the fourth quarter's activity is improving".
The US trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared with September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected a deepening deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is that the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, reflects the growth in the economies of the main U.S. trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, new unemployment registrations in the United States rose against expectations last week to 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to a year's low", noted Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3,482% from 3,423% on Tuesday night and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4,492% from 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power consume the "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday spoiled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were slaughtered in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist said.
Down the Yankees, "mercenaries!" "The street belongs to revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!" shouted, fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The women were escorted by civilian officers who came to "protect them".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" in Havana had taken place the previous day, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, about a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to march on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by civilian-robed police, an AFP reporter said.
Police forcefully put dissidents in civilian vehicles who were beaten up by government supporters, the journalist said.
The arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances usually lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White" were the recipients of the 2005 European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", according to one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda was among a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in custody.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by pro-government activists against "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A gunman stabbed an 80-year-old man and wounded five in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A gunman with two knives killed a man in his 80s and wounded five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at a rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to the initial evidence of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an 80-year-old man, in or outside a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses have reported.
Seriously wounded, the old man, born in 1929, died in hospital from his injuries, according to an Alliance police union official.
At or near the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his early 30's, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octagenarian died.
The other victim's life is in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, police sources say.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He reportedly injured two passersby, apparently by chance - a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old man, the latter seriously.
The script was confusing throughout the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried in a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a union official in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to reports collected by AFP, tried to control the force.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was brave, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their chief, tried to call the gunman and were wounded by fists, police sources said.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, put him in a safe position, and I saw a very serious wound in his abdomen, said 35-year-old pharmacist Frédéric Allione to AFP.
Five minutes later, another man in his 30's came in, wounded by a knife.
It was the National Police who arrested the man without his ID.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office has seized the investigation from the Hauts-de-Seine Police Department (SDPJ 92).
The foreman was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out that he was committed to a mental hospital.
Another police source said it took six policemen to get him to the Clichy Police Station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" as "all the forcibles of this species whose forces are multiplied by the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again demands the prosecution be dropped
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, the US, the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently resident in Switzerland for a morals case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of The Pianist, denounced three judges of the California Court of Appeal for the Second District of California for serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, Mr Hummel said, adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in my back".
He said Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed, before he delivered his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison -- which is a serious misconduct.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", by the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared in late September that he had " lied " to the documentary's author.
If the court refused to drop the charges, Mr Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed at first instance, namely that no charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Deputy Los Angeles County Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing".
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?
She says the filmmaker "asks for a favor at the court, while disregarding its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there were other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to call for the discontinuation of the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also called for an end to the prosecution once again.
Recalling that her client can no longer bear to be harassed at every turnaround of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up without direction, held back by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange went out of business on Friday, in a market torn between better than US forecasts and the dollar's rise: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains at a narrow margin, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion as to the strength of the economic recovery", Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
US consumer confidence also improved sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
However, the index has been held back by a further rise in the dollar, to its highest level in two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday night and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of traveling across South Africa, the 112 Miss World contestants are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to realize their dream of being voted the world's most beautiful woman by a billion viewers.
At this grand beauty mass held for the second year running in the suburbs of Johannesburg, five of them have already gotten their tickets to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen as Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African tour.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town was amazing.
I have seen and experienced so much! exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't have dreamed of a better country to give my crown to.
This was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the southern summer heat.
For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press briefings and safari, the Misses are now focused on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and ran for office, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, Miss India launches with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will be the main theme of this 59th edition.
Candidates will be walking around in traditional costume and, of course, swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Miss World President Julia Morley.
The candidates, like last year, took a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Not a running one for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their best memory will probably be the South West Cape draw for the 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I could get close to.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive", his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was scheduled to go to his father's bedside, who had been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (21h00 GMT).
The singer's son, who is calm, said he would be taken "very soon" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent suffering and to be able to administer treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had previously been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation on Wednesday night due to serious injuries resulting from this operation.
His wife Laeticia went to a French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning to attend a school performance, a photographer for AFP said.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would be visiting the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Monceau International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about a possible upcoming court case, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday had "gone to Los Angeles far too quickly, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it was amazing to me, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
He had earlier stated on RTL that the singer had apparently "gone without drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had performed the operation on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also had surgery on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he's also a reputable doctor, convicted several times by the courts, in medical liability files, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who is "regularly prosecuted" before the Order Council, and who is "far from being commendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
The doctor said the operation had "perfectly proceeded well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been increasing since this summer, seems to be in a state of paralysis.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January as planned seems very short, Mr Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and calls on the New Centre to stop using its acronym
The UDF, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, on Friday reacted to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to use the name of the former Giscard party as OPA, stressing that it should no longer use it on any means, subject to legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his move, he received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (former UMP who has been in the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark for being the first to file it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be dispossessed, went out of its silence to issue a warning to the minister and the member, urging them to stop using the acronym and to hand over ownership of the brand to them, subject to legal action.
You have multiplied statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take up the UDF abbreviation, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centre Alliance.
You also thought it was good to have the name of the movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan +UDF Today+, also on your campaign material and on the page of your website, the signers of the letter note.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this acronym, says the UDF office, which urges the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from any media and website".
It also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the mark to its rightful owners".
If you do not, the courts will be taken to uphold the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
The Office said that Hervé de Charette was "not a UDF member for three years" but a UMP member "when he filed the trademark".
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of filing the UDF acronym to do so on his own behalf.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before making a mockery of the NC strategy: "We think that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of power
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of the weakness of the octogenarian to plunder part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of power, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means there will be a trial in this saga-worthy case of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are torn apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before 10 March 2010 stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a weak state and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will tell her about it, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr Georges Kiejman, at the hearing.
The Court of First Instance has also held that the Court of First Instance's decision to grant a stay of proceedings to the applicant is not justified.
This is excellent news. . . . The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court was to consider the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers' action, the lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the family's big unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since she got married".
The Nanterre prosecutor's office again held that the complainant was not entitled to proceedings, especially since a judge in the custody of the child was refusing in recent days to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full legal capacity, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has to act for him", said Marie-Christine Daubigney, Public Service Representative.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of French big business, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the attitude of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of getting employees to adhere to 'values' determined from above as it used to be, of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By placing the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has put the market-conquest strategies back in place... although the authoritarian attempt to impose products that are disconnected from customer preference factors is constantly coming back!
The demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects managers.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EIE "requires a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision from all stakeholders" and requires a commitment from employees that is totally contradicted by authoritarian management revenues.
We therefore call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees, lead to this change in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- Firstly, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally, after many misconduct, comes to do first... what it has always done!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism is one of the pathologies of power, it grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- And lastly, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
They have a mechanical understanding of psychology, having come from the engineering schools.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioural theory, recently reactivated by the US "neuroscience" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by research institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "levers" of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr reassures leaders in a mechanistic governance stance, unsuitable in today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires a finalist view of human behaviour.
It is a fundamental fact that all reasoning and governance practice must include: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly seen as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies from the Functional Motivation Analysis adopt this view of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxa which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilising factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and bring their human resource management back to the "place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: "Justice war" deserves praise right to Obama
The American right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had announced the award to Mr Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, a right-wing Republican, to USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the "sometimes necessary" theme of war in her recently published memoirs.
War is of course the last thing I think Americans want to have to do, but it's necessary.
She thought we should stop these terrorists out there.
Mr Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, used force in Oslo on Thursday to justify his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I found the speech very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
In some ways, I found this speech historic", said Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former candidate, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said he was pleased to see "a left-wing president" remind Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not present a peace prize if there was no use of force".
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush columnist and now a columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", he "spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security they did not create and that they do little to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few on the right who were not convinced was a Bush-era falcon, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "slow, wrenched and uninspiring" on National Review Online.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When you envelop war in the notion of justice, you can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained flattered by the president's position.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproductive" even for a talented speaker.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily reported.
Mr. Obama "made the right speech", the New York Times said, calling it "both dark and upbuilding".
Road trips: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the trade unions and TLF, the only employer organisation to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening ending the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" at the agreement after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement soon after.
This was despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 6 p.m. the text to be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the end of the year holidays", said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a 4% increase in wages for lowest wage earners (in local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase in wages for the highest wage earners (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage workers, the rate goes from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but we are going a long way, said Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to order our activists to stop the blockade, no blockade of the supply centers.
But you can still have some recalcitrant who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to grant the high wage increases given the international competition".
He said the increases would be around €170 a month for low-wage workers and €100 to €120 for higher payers.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of the Internet has been rejected.
The agreement also provides for a 3% revalorization of travel costs and the maintenance of the road transport general status in the first half of 2010, which will allow for the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement to be addressed.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a €100 million reduction in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 amending finance bill, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "on the same terms".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies that are members of the TLF and secondly to the entire profession, if extended by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Mr Bussereau assured.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "deception market" as the €100 million "was already promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has urged us to negotiate urgently, not as a result of a shared analysis, but so as not to upset the turkey eaters of next New Year's Eve, the UNSTA lamented.
The agreement risks "grabbing the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months", the OTH said.
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with the RATP proposals
Disruptions on RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the second day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10am and 8pm, due to one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travelers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which have 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER crosses the western part of the city of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran during rush hour, and almost no ferries during rush hour as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the docks, the French organized themselves.
Early in the morning, the station in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of college and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger, Marne, 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina said he got up "thirty hours early to make sure he was on time".
The station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had planned to train police and police.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left from Saint-Lazare station to join the subway.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to review the results of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon, which the unions deemed "major".
The Director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in brackets, the CGT was indignant, stressing that management "did not care to solve a problem whereas for road users and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a wider review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
The unions were also told that the company "laughed at weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had raided a branch committee at the headquarters in Paris.
The management, which had hitherto refused to discuss the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a desire to appease".
The conflict threatens to spread to RER B on Tuesday, following a notice by Unsa and Independants.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line per million daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second stage of their careers, receive between €2,200 and €2,700 in gross premiums and €600 to €650 in premiums for shifted hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision heavy with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday that the country's main pro-Kurdish party had been dissolved, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could make the government's task much more difficult, as it has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the state's independence and indivisible unity", Court President Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimously taken by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity for Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled MPs.
The decision follows a 2007 proceedings by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "guidelines" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, in an attempt to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have escalated in clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast with a Kurdish majority.
Law enforcement fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones with flint grenades.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said the court's decision would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, which is made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
He added that the PKK's reaction was obviously to be expected.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service (FES) says that this is not to disturb the citizens.
It's just so the agents can test the vehicle's technique and learn how to control it.
And according to the weather forecasters, it could be this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are standing ready to attack the snow and ice.
The ESF has a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow over the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel along 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes the busy streets, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße are also included.
The ESF officers start their duty at 3 a.m.
If necessary, the 1,040 km of road must be salted with a solid road solvent within a maximum of 3 hours.
The ESF service is therefore to start at 3 a.m. 'so that roads are cleared when daily migration traffic begins'.
It gets harder when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This is a problem, the head of the road clearance and sanding department tells us, "because no driver is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, when the snow is gone, we take care of the access roads and the service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets out to clear the hazardous areas and passages as a priority.
As regards cycle paths, ESF services are generally not able to handle them.
Mr Brauburger said that there is a special service in Frankfurt which monitors the condition of bridges between 10pm and 4:30am.
Since ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles come in as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also sometimes call on this special service in case of need.
The birthplace of the dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipedal was about 2 meters long and 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp, curved teeth, its short arms were terminated by needle claws, and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangées, and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the early dinosaurs.
It tells us about the kinship ties, the distribution, and the characteristics of the kinship.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Triassic period.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says this is a remarkable discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he notes that it confirms some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
The current state of knowledge suggests that dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the earliest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the earliest dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when the Saurids were divided into three major groups of evolution: the théropodes (carnivores) which include the later Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor and from which the birds, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and their relatives and ornithovid herbivores, including species such as the triceratops and the stégosaurus, are descended.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and colleagues, the Tawa is one of the earliest theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says Nesbitt.
Researchers have found clues suggesting that the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in its bones at the level of its skull, as do the birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe than mammals.
It seems that the Tawa hallae's vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the great sauropod's related lineage also had airbags and a slight bone, it can be assumed that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurids had appeared there.
As a result, the three main lines of evolution have split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, the whole emerging land that formed the supercontinent Pangé.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The researchers argue that all three species cannot be descended from a common ancestor who may have migrated.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the journal Science Studies says that there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silsaurus, that lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to the dinosaurs.
He said this could give a false impression because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved, whereas there are hardly any on other continents.
However, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant secondary-age tetrapods while originating from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery to this day.
In the Triassic period, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present-day crocodiles and many other Saurids.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, promoting the development of many new species, while others, related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not permanent.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction where dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles disappeared.
Or maybe the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not permanent.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite helped to develop a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic period and had been in shadow since then: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signers from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
There are those of the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is making waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English,they condemned the police intervention requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler had the buildings occupied by the students and teachers on strike evacuated after walls and artworks were graffiti-painted.
Five students were injured in the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the degradation did not justify "so violent an intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own classes".
The evacuation represents an 'unacceptable violation' of freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on vandalism acts only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and attempts to forget the reasons for the mobilisation.
The University's Steering Committee thus avoided any necessary debates.
The court officials demand that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
Most of the occupants were not involved in the demolitions.
Legitimation of the protests
The youth of the Green Service Sector Union and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) are showing solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
The Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) took action against the actions of the University President and the police.
We thank the president of the university.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the Aktuelle Stunde television programme.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU member of the regional parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU is using a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left (Left) party
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and claims, we evacuate them.
The Left Party has tabled a motion requiring the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it was known as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under Soviet rule a secret weapons research site under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Large production and research facilities in micro and nanoelectronics are located there.
Since September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the Frankfurt Science Centre, with academic institutes and companies from the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a Protocol on close cooperation.
The signatories were Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Zelenograd Prefect Anatoly Smimov for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose focus is scientific research, will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies are looking to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It is home to the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally translated as  Green City ) takes its name from the forested hills at the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake on Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be put high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than the new heart of Europe.
If you will, S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate construction chaos for about a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The front-line stations, with lanes ending in the city centre, were reputed at the time to be the relics of 19th century transportation technology that had the effect of braking modern rail traffic because it took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure is what you're supposed to do.
That is why the front-line stations in Frankfurt and Munich must disappear.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project is really about to begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long since become incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, front-line stations have not really been a problem since modern, reversible trains with carriages and driver cars at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now underway alongside the new inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and local policies have taken over.
The railway company is a party to the project because it is the taxpayer who pays the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From an urban perspective, this project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space that if you believe in it, computer-generated planners' graphics will be very green.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The passing station and the extension of the section are designed for the traffic of people which was characterised by a huge growth in the 1980s.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road trucks.
But the new track, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be absorbed in the Swabian project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other junction and congestion points in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the 180-kilometre extension of the section through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to get the mushroom right here.
But the S21 project is a braking boot.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming a bottleneck for international goods traffic in the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the judgment given on the airport
In the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, the Land government discussed the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal from a legal point of view, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Court of First Instance of the Land of Kassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations on the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project to build the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorisation to take off for 17 aircraft between 11pm and 5am, as the Land Government is considering, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens from nighttime air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January whether it wants to appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticizes this deadline and tries to pressure the government representative to withdraw the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD group leader Torsten Schafer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election pledge to ban night flights, otherwise it will be seen as a complete breach of a given promise.
It is extremely difficult to be allowed to keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch rejects the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel, who claims that the Land government is still trying to allow night robberies using "advocacy and bribery".
It takes time to carry out a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision based on a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of the statements made by its section on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
US banks reimburse the aid
The big American banks, deeply affected by the crisis, are breaking off their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid the Treasury in full $45 billion (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the assistance provided under the Tarp rescue plan.
The US television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of restrictions imposed on the acceptance of funds, such as limiting the bonuses allocated to managers and paying higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's coffers, which are well filled by the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of the Bank of America, expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayers for the large amount of capital that was injected into the bank to help overcome a difficult time.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying up investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to raise money in the financial markets to free itself from state supervision.
The US bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated elections
Eventually, though, everything happened faster than expected.
Only two weeks after the dismissal of the current deputy editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote on the appointment last night.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editorial board of ZDF, was the big favorite.
The channel has not, however, wanted to confirm the vote - officially - so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also a willingness not to further harm the ZDF's manager Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Management Board.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 of the 14 Commissioners.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council voted in favour of Brender's re-election and seven others voted against.
The CDU, which has a majority on the Board of Directors, had already indicated several weeks before the vote that it did not want Brender back in office.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly respected editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had decreased under Brender.
This is why protests continued, almost until the vote, undermining the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had intervened in the debate and who felt Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it's not gonna help.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, education and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhine-Palatinate radio organ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF, first of all at the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief at the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (a bimonthly news programme presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial staff.
After Brender's disgrace, as he was just named journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not consider calling for the removal of political figures from the ZDF's supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered before the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the Commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political party.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-leaning liberal.
The main focus of the study is on the
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates from the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor's or Master's students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
They agreed in particular to reduce the burden of examinations: one single examination should be used to close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure 'realistic and acceptable proportions'.
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also committed to more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master programmes.
At regional level, there must be no different legislation from one Land to another.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education and university rectors have been constantly using the phrase 'education'.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to reduce the number of certain examinations considerably: "Each module must normally be able to be completed by a single examination", as can be seen in a 30-page document on future conditions for admission to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council, says that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the slippage, which greatly impaired the studying ability.
In addition, 'studiable' should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules and the background must be carefully examined to see if the feeling of suffocation that sometimes occurs when choosing courses can be avoided.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information from the Kunduz RAID, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the necessary room for manoeuvre to enable and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new academic courses but will also be adapted to existing courses.
These cycles must be 'reaccredited' every 5 years, which means, however, that all cycles will not be reviewed until 2015.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and higher education institutions have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only Land to date which has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutoring programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices, exam offices and the International Relations Department.
The Länder and universities have a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
After that, you will only need to pass one exam to finish your studies.
The organisation of studies will need to be more flexible, the recognition of the results of other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the 'education' of all academic courses will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of the conditions for education in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like to see the organisation of education policy no longer taking place "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
The students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little later than the educational strike.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel. "The experience of students is very useful to us", she said on Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
The decision taken in Bonn is not far enough for the Education and Science Union (GEW), which requires the right and the possibility for every Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master's course.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also calls for the Länder to ensure that today's bachelor students have enough places for master's studies and the best possible study conditions tomorrow.
The Länder therefore have to hire more trainers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not discuss the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is through these words that a work by the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in disturbing sentences the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany and gained freedom but at the same time lost his language territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later a collector at a publishing house for young people before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at Frankfurt's Goethe University and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about himself in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorted mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly unstable and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Enrollment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, someone who has not sufficiently resisted the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate.
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary interplay with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of Romanian-born German authors, by a case that clearly shows the depths and lowliness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, says literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
He could have pulled him out of all the difficult situations of the time, according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make that comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement to this public was unexpected, however the admission by a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the security spies, Herta Müller had already written in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were hiding behind the last borrowed names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the heritage of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic enlightenment has been thwarted and curbed in recent years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the return of the files has been delayed since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very strong, as confirmed by an interview with a former official of the Securitate in Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed great contempt for the laureate.
She had psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The shame of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
It is true that many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as is so often the case in the context of hidden guilt.
The balanced reaction of the audience, in Söllner's own words, leaves hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who was awarded the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The Champions League riots
It seemed that a representative was coming, with four pins on his head, from a nice Christmas party, on which the sportswear manufacturer had spread its goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross boarded a Mercedes C-Class at midnight, which he had just called, a plastic orange bag from the supplier in his hand.
The man, whose bald head attracted attention, was led into a city that was still a stranger to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have driven himself. He hadn't drunk alcohol and he wasn't drunk with happiness.
He had a nice night, but I had to get back to work tomorrow.
Because that's when it was gonna start.
The words of the Swiss who had just signed up three days earlier were clear:  We have reached the eighth final  that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3-1 win against Romania's Unirea Urziceni  but we must not be blinded by the success.
The big job is coming up on Sunday.
The main objective is to repeat the results of the Champions League in Mainz on a daily basis.
We must also overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals scored by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing
The eighth Champions League final (going match 16/17. + 23.24 February/ return match 9/10. + 16.17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant inauguration was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the lucky one, who had given the unstable Stuttgart professionals a flawless motivation and pleasure to play.
I went to see the players and told them to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "soul plumber" Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but no longer worked with Mr Babbel.
It triggered some magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things never thought possible happen".
And Sami Khedira, who after weeks of injury break, rose to the rank of best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon of a proverbial fresh wind and the new boss's working method: he is someone who moves to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the present situation.
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart have not yet crossed the line, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs to be more resilient.
Like Gross, players and the manager are careful not to overestimate victory against a totally outdated and weakened Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having a bad wake up four days later at Leverkusen with a 0:4 record, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't crossed the difficult path yet.
Heldt's heart was not in the party on his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, due to the events of the weekend that a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the game began.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would argue, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the management of weak style and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann had also judged it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games was taken away from him.
Lehmann's statements were marked by pure selfishness. Heldt was down and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming lifelong friends for those two forty-year-olds.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that without the group's prior work by the coach replaced, strong sports and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were  for the most part in the success  retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus  and even the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World heavyweight championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gesturally challenged world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as the World Heavyweight Champion according to the WBC version.
The judges unanimously agreed to the points.
Hamburg  Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points-on-points victory by unanimous decision of the judges against US national Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
The Ukrainian had previously won the WBO and WBC World Championships twice.
Unfortunately, he didn't get the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, who won 39 professional fights in 41 of them, had to admit defeat twice because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight from a height of 2.02 meters, on his left.
Johnson, who was 11 centimetres smaller and had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous right-handed opponent into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried to get past the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having surpassed the distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko by calling him a vicious zombie who is not really capable.
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose so he could see his eyes.
Fourth win since Klitschko came back.
Klitschko was reinstated in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape. Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is the WBO and IBF champion.
But it is the British David Haye who, having deposed the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled for September.
It seems that his promotion company is now planning to play this match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontline attack by the opposition: the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left (left) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately hiding certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formulated a counter-revolution" on the deadly attack on two tankers last September, the head of the Green Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday during the news broadcast of the TAGESSchau network (the 8pm newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is essentially the content of the NATO report which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the target of the attack was not actually to destroy the stolen trucks, but to kill two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the US airstrike, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak before the federal parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Renate Künast party believe that Mrs Angela Merkel should make clear whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government if the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasingly strong voices of doubt about the real reasons for the firing of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to information in the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given to Guttenberg about the tank truck attack was both accurate and complete.
Officially, they would have hidden the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The two senior officials, however, are said to have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert has in the meantime requested clarification in a letter.
So far , he hasn 't gotten an answer .
On Saturday, the Ministry declined to comment on the allegations and referred the matter to the Federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which was to be set up on Wednesday to shed light on the facts.
The worlds of dreams
Some people, waking up, see images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms, we can engage unhindered in the craziest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who is awake, experiencing the dream state, hearing and seeing things that others do not perceive, soon gains a reputation in our Western world as being crazy or drugged, or at least as being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in people with mental illness or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's at work: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paint or write novels, but sometimes it causes the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to blend.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can come in many different forms, at best called visions, at worst madness.
But even though the trigger and the effect are distinct, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are all due to very similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenia.
Earth's force of attraction no longer has power over a person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakenedness; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's the fall of 2001 when Henning T is transformed into a comic book character.
Her body is two-dimensional, with creamy colors.
Earth's gravity is no longer in control of him, he's floating off the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him were devil creatures with wings, grimaces, mouths with blood, showing teeth.
They chased him and beat him with flaming boots and threw him against the walls. His whole body was in pain.
There were thundering, mean, screaming voices coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can't stand the insults and humiliations of those voices.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He's riding a buffalo and he's putting the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is untied.
Let's learn a lesson, the voices in the choir are yelling at him to pull out his eardrum.
Henning T. is now 40 years old, and has had six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first nearly 20.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition to being manic-depressive, he is taking medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the affected person can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitement, which can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious mind is drowned in sensations.
Like dreaming, psychosis opens the door to a tide of ideas and fantasies that emerge from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the CHU in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the center of the situation, but the meaning is centered on him.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
They generally have no chance of adjusting reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
To experience a hallucination once in a lifetime.
Unlike dreams, Fuchs says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved".
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, and the alienation from experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains make these kinds of convertibles is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose momentary perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people concerned have minimal brain damage.
The brain's neuronal maturation is thought to be disrupted early in development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the abnormality of the neural system occurs and also the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role  stress or a traumatic experience can trigger psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they affect neurotransmitters.
When our brains are warming up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from hallucinations and take expensive medications to get rid of them, while others buy expensive drugs to get rid of them.
The perception of pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory images for the past decade. Last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are not only a typical concomitant phenomenon of psychosis but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain is warming up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulation, stress, love mourning or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and attends high school.
A very normal girl, really.
If there were no pictures and no voices.
While they were playing, a young boy, thin, long haired, spoke to her.
When she replied, her friends looked at her and were amazed that no one else saw or heard about this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She wakes up, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even feel his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this nice young man.
Am I crazy? she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, apparitions are usually scary.
The visions are often heavy.
When she's in class, she can't take classes because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears when he's invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations to the board.
At night, apparitions are usually scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she awaits sleep, which comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grim faces or the girl with bloodstained marks on her arms and legs are before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at these creatures.
She won't tell her parents or friends, they'd think she's crazy.
In the fall of 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with psychologist Kasten online, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or not stimulated enough, there is a high likelihood that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I suppose the brain isn't busy enough, so it's animating.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was a child and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she called dad, since she was of age to think, was not her real father.
These are the same areas of the brain that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it's very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real".
For Kasten, nightmares are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, a mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There's no difference between dreaming and hallucination.
In our world too consciously centred, unfortunately, we are quickly becoming more and more inclined to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of consciousness modification aroused by dreams.
The dream experiences are very complex halves that are perceived as real by the person who is experiencing them and cannot be distinguished from the dream even when awake.
The condition of one-child consciousness is manifested during trauma or in extreme pathological situations such as in patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious and experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened with a loss of himself and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, with his own imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
It's a state of mind that is the boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change is taking place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, of the capacity to organise which is given to us humans so as not to sink into the void of loss of conscience.
Everything is real even later in memory.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also described his one-eyed experiences in his book "Changing of Heart" as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when he consciously left for a journey of several days after a heart valve operation followed by a transplant. During this time, his body was condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he created from scratch, visits foreign places, time travel, sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the middle ages among nobles who made drugs from blood.
He's kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle driver who takes him back to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the fog of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He absorbs himself completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memory.
According to Claussen, these interior journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It may even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience is what sets the horizon for our other everyday experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the dream delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of the outer reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow may fall
Burda
At 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to join the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% family-owned.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at age 27 and are determined to be part of society, said Hubert Burda, 69, to the Spiegel.
All the details were settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be raised later.
We will also have to see if they are capable of doing so.
You can't force your children to work for 7500 people without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would destroy the kids as well as the business.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was stepping down as President and CEO as of January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first in charge of the technology sector.
He was subsequently in charge of the Treasury sector, which meant that he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left he also took over the marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time, it's not a family member who's running the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 respectively, and her son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda said the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always been in families that have been led by a capital bulimia, which has made huge unfortunate speculations thinking they could climb higher and higher.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself as a national coach, as Springer could, and I do not intend to be part of such international leagues as Time, which have become too important.
Full beauty
Anything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the objective which seems to have been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened a multi-disciplinary area of more than 1000 m2 in the Callao shopping centre in Madrid, dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food court, with a tea room in particular, which offers over 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or renting out the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own Beauty Party with eight of your friends and relax through a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy services.
Like cavities to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual trainers, which guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It starts with introducing your personal code on a touchscreen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise programme.
Her manager says that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to get all the muscles in the body working.
And if, after working our bodies, we want to go through the hair salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer customized hair repair, lighting or nutrition rituals.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the keywords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied harvests
Christmas is coming and it's never superfluous to study the look of the stars to fit our party wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the figure, is one of the variables we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie has chosen an overly complicated, overly uncouth style.
Endesa and Barcelona, getting the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the Oficina LIVE.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the Implementation of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of electric cars in the city and will implement mobility agreements, by taking steps, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
The idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3  electric cities 
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities selected by the government under the MOVELE Plan to launch the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in promoting the electric car.
The company is involved in European standardisation groups and is currently working on a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a future of tranquility for the motor industry
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees a future of tranquility for the Spanish automotive industry, which he said is the country's main export sector.
In presenting the President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures the Executive had launched during the year to support the automotive sector.
 Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites , the Government President said.
 Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector , he added.
In this respect, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Integrated Automotive Sector Plan (IAP), has allocated EUR 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which have mobilised an investment of over EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that the investment was intended to develop new models and to modernise existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted governmental demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and has contributed to a sharp increase in registrations, which increased by 40% in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Car Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor industry.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition area is 20 000 m2 and will be attended by more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only are motorcycles and collectible cars available, but also all kinds of motor-related items can be found at ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collecting engine that will make collectors and curious people happy.
Among the participating companies are Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in automotive sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist in Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of the fair will also include parallel activities: meetings, sporting exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Competence tests with collectible cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: a sustainable sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sports mind is not upset about respecting the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the i-Stop engine stop and start system into the Mazda3 - a device that is currently only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is characterised by the overall good grade it has achieved.
Details, vehicle finish, housing, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these are remarkable features of the new Mazda3.
Starting with the steering wheel, the front seats are excellent in ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the ensemble of the control panel and console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright red and blue colours.
This style is, in part, reminiscent of the Honda Civic.
The Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are therefore in contrast to the sobriety of German products, and in particular to the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough accommodation to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Add to all this a large regular-shaped chest.
The automatic engine shutdown and start system is available, at least for the time being, only on the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed gear shift.
This engine is a real happiness, characterised by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3s are diesel models, those that do not run a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude the gasoline-powered i-Stop, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
As regards the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sporty, i.e. the one with the most number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the dead angle change assistant (RVM) removing traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive internal mirror, the large screen controller, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels are particularly notable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional EUR 1 500, included, among other elements, the bi-xenon adaptive headlamps and a BOSE audio system with a disc loader.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is characterised in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version, which is only equipped with a 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will provide us with a great deal of satisfaction every day.
The first luxury
L.A. is covering the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have given us more glow than ever, dressed in stylish and sexy models for Nine's release.
Our sophisticated as usual, Pe had chosen a dark lady.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows you to only look at your email, without even offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
It is true that it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what, for example, the iPhone's data subscription costs.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life, for six times more than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He's as limited as his American grandfather, but he's got a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, which is around €12, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or Fon connection) to access their mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and it should have worked for a long time.
Some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but I would need a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated calls for affordable roaming charges throughout Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of their home country, they are reluctant to use the data, and they are not wrong.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (which is still curious to know why it is called Fon even though it does not have Wifi) offers this type of rate means that operators are starting to think differently and are looking at different proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book downloading and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifetime purchase option like Peek already offers in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I wish it simply because I believe it is a more fair formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, she did indeed choose the same to accompany him in the second, undoubtedly most important moment of his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow with bright green reflections, both times, the outfit was made up of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States is following the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to wear the same outfit.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
If the office was to be filled with a thick lace, it was to be printed in a velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green, medium-heeled shoes for the first occasion, and a similar but golden model this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now lifted from the place it was before.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for young women who want to be mothers.
This is shown in the study Fertility and career of women in Spain, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, which was conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not and the type of employment she is engaged in.
Women who are not active outside the home, work part-time or have unstable jobs, marry earlier, get their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable jobs, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back on mating and first pregnancies and have fewer children.
Women aged 35-49 with fixed employment have their first child on average 3.7 years after they have settled in a couple, rising to 4.1 for those in the public sector.  These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which has led them to delay union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment employed has a large influence on maternity, but less on the date of the start of cohabitation, says Margarita Delgado, CSIC researcher.
The level of education is another factor which widen the age gap between women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35-49, those who had completed primary and secondary education were first mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 years respectively.
 Another distinction is also made between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed primary education get married and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this programme and prioritize obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child, Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is good too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year onwards, the German actress will be the face of several brand products, singing the universal motto 'Because I'm good at it'.
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, Anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its most important representatives, designers and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, were voted Model of the Year.
The Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does so not by predictable and apprehensive genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core dignition of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent doesn't spare the fears or the lighting.
It is a delightful book, and it is also a moving invitation to read and recite.
I'll leave you with a few snapshots.
About Albert Camus:  In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god. 
About Samuel Beckett:  Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him. 
About Graham Greene: Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.
On James Joyce:  Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.  It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed from the north face, on which the best mountaineers still let go and still take. 
About William Faulkner: He was a strange guy.
He sometimes said he was the heir to a county landlord, and sometimes he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline:  This writer collected the mad cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the late 20th century night, in its literary form, and he did so in flight from himself and invoking the afterlife with a violent speech to the astrocots. 
About Dorothy Parker:  One day she knelt down and prayed:  Dear God, I beg you to stop me writing like a woman. 
On Joseph Conrad:  On his grave were engraved the worms of Spenser:  Sleep after the effort, / after the storm the carry, / after the rest after the war, / after the life, tired death takes. 
About Virginia Wolf:  In her luggage she also carried her depression.
Her husband would normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was playing among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness.
About Pío Baroja: What did Martín-Santos do other than try to hide Joyce from Baroja ?
What did Benet do if not to have Baroja shot by Faulkner ?
What did he do, but seek the glory of this man to serve as a footstool for him?
A Cowardly Attack
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking around our neighborhood in the city of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15 to 18-year-olds passed by her and our dog, a blood-soaked, spa-saved dog weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they put two shots on her feet that left the dog seriously injured.
Our outrage is immense because we don't see the fun of attacking a small, defenseless animal that was also on the leash for nothing.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she hurt these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, since an energy agent who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than he.
The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. on a Tuesday as usual in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been groaning all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the local police station, although we doubt it will do much good and to avoid touching the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are met.
We don't understand what happens to young people that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and companionship.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for wearing the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protection element to prevent head injuries or even death in a two-wheeler accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever safer products, and said it was contributing to this goal through other educational and information activities.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of two-wheeled helmets, under the motto  To be or not to be , will involve a first phase in which posters will be distributed to more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure their widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company, as as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers' employers' union Anfac and the dealer's union Ganvam.
The good news is that the November 2008 comparison was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% from the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound in the previous month, the cumulative registrations during these 11 months were 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of tourist cars, pickup trucks, vans, light trucks and light chassis trucks) are added together, 95 853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect the most demand have not disappeared, because although they are also bought by individuals, most purchases are made by small and mediumsized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
In addition to the restrictions imposed by the limitation of bank credit, other factors such as rising unemployment or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourist vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid was of little use.
In addition to individuals, freelancers and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
The need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated yesterday at Ganvam.
The Association of Dealers is forecasting a similar year to the year ending 2010, for which it estimates a fall in sales (tourist and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now compulsory
As has been the case with the ABS brake blockage system and as will be the case with ESP stability control, emergency brake support systems will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
They are already mandatory for newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while a shortage period has been set for the rest of the vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's action aims to strengthen pedestrian protection, although it can also help to avoid many rear-end shocks by acting.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system by the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure on until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not used all their force.
Up to 1100 accidents
The assistance intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these types of components, up to 1100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularisation of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, by means of a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he/she will help by increasing the pedal pressure if necessary.
If it does not react and although collision is inevitable, the device shall apply maximum brake force to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones the Opel plan until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas, Sarajevo, were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April, possibly on 8 April, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to conclude the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, understands that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
However, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian Converg group, is taking on a bigger role.
If it does not agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is upheld.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and most valuable piece of jewelry, Porsche engineers started with the Boxster S and managed to lose less than 80 kilograms, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to, first of all, to do without the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual padded roof, which reduced the weight by 21 kg, to use aluminium doors like the GT3's, 15 kg less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kg, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kg gained, to mount sports racks, another 12 kg, and with light 19 inch tires, five kg.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining six more kilograms and replacing the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK, the test was performed on a six-speed manual clutch model, mainly on California's secondary network roads in the mountains, with particularly winding corners.
His behaviour can only be described as impeccable.
The weight loss does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with a sharp gait.
On the contrary: we had not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time which at the same time guaranteed such safety in turns, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a slow pace for as long as it takes, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
Thanks to his directing, as communicative as he is, the car will do what our hands tell us to do.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
The sound of a motor at will
The sound of its 320-horsepower V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the  sport  option or with a system that changes the engine's roar, already used on the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, either at stop or at recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road linings we drove with the Boyxster Spyder were pretty damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up all along the way, while at some corners we found ice early in the morning and gravel later in the morning.
It's a very lightweight car, the most fun to drive, and it's much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be available in February 2010 at a price of 70 831 euros.

Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral won a spectacular 91-82 victory on the hard field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team.
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important gaps of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, who took advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter suggested that they had jumped on Israeli soil with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artists in the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same note, but the Alava team chose Barak's inner play and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with applause and applause back at his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's  minus six  rating already suggested that the night was not going to be the best for the Brazilian.
But in that match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that it is not so easy to win on their pitch, and thanks to the hand of Elias, they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the gaining of the advantage over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, who were injured but not dead, needed to complete some skillful actions to catch air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, which with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas returned the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and which the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play for all in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the win was missed at Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Wounds prevent the Unicaja from fighting
Lnicaja lost in a loud defeat to Olympiacos in Greece and gave up the lead of Euroleague Group B in a match marked by the absence of players from Lnicaja, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not alarmed by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The first quarter's game was a dream come true for the Andalusians, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point field goals, two from leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
LOlympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the home games of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, helped to reverse the score 22-20, in the 13th minute, when an action, a start of a fight, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team started to function by showing superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
Lithuanian in-house players and winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, drilled the lead 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
A ride that is impossible
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to match the difference of the match in Malaga 66-48, in the 27th minute, shaking the group's head.
LUnicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last outing of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organisation, Cook's three-point baskets and Lewis' support, left a bit of hope with 66-57 in the 31st minute.
But the win was virtually impossible because Olympiacos showed ruthlessness when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the score to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja surrendered, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you get paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out what they would earn based on their profile through a new Trovit app, the search engine with the most small real estate, job and vehicle ads in Spain.
The tool  How much should you be paid?  calculates users' salaries from the more than 140 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you wish to work.
In the week since the application started, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, Spanish workers feel underpaid, said Albert Ribera, Trovit's product manager.
According to data from Trovità's search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the least well-paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 euros gross annually and a Frenchman receives 31 059 euros gross while a Spanishman receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives a gross annual income of EUR 34 247 in England, EUR 25 751 in France and EUR 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with net annual EUR 11 592, followed by that of a salesman, with EUR 14 725, and that of a worker, with EUR 15 667.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President shall resign from the diplomatic delegation by 27 January 2010, the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the business manager of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
 He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his term of office, he must seek another destination 
The channel also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline expires:  My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government , Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition imposed on him by the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After days of pink since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant market, uncertainty has re-emerged, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly by giving ample liquidity at near-zero rates so that financial institutions can buy assets to be mobilised.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually completed and, without calling into question their nonconformist liquidity policies, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their tendering next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Exchange volatility and corporate bond deviations are rising again, although they are still very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is a resurgence in quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have been the investors' refuges, increasing the gap between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further revision to the Kingdom of Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad enough to silence moral risk advocates, who were once again trying to stir up a sense of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, while what should be done is to decree a new day of thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a tribal struggle between the emirates to regain their place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be quite irrational for the ECSC to save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area country to default on its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that the ECF has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and holds its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excess in high positions, this would be foreseeable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt gaps increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we need not worry.
If European gaps were to decrease and ours to continue to increase, then there would be an idiosyncratic risk of Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote: when our forecast indicators force most research services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their forecasts for 2011 upwards, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back on the job with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now prudence is the mother of security.
Connected sectors
President Ignacio Sánchez Galán, President of the Commission for Energy, was the first to speak yesterday before the Subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy for Spain for the next two decades is being discussed.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had said before the subcommittee at eight o'clock.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50 billion by 2020 and an additional €60 billion between then and 2030 if the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If not, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
However, Iberdola considers that investment in the next decade should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to international distribution networks and interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and we'll need to increase power.
Its bet is on both gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW more are needed, with additional supporting energy.
Galán, who believes that the government's recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with his company's demands, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
He said there was a clear long-term bet on this, despite the one-off measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
However, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to be made, as they take some time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the air Lingus handling market at ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground air services, will be the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, is for a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Junta and the University of Alcalá in Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The Alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy and water company.
The project involved is an estimated tunnel costing A$1.7 billion (about A$1.047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are rivals.
A 5km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway dealer.
The city council wants to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the auspices of Ernst & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and tolling.
Pending the submission of their tenders in May, the planned investment is A$1.7 billion (about A$1.047 million) and in the final phase three consortia will be facing each other, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is run by Acciona, the only Spanish smoothie company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium is being built against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Welsh public works company, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatisations, but entry is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
This strategy was followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, who have already been mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and is still an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place on this market by holding a 30% stake in Hochtief, which owns Leighton.
The assets of millionaires
Acciona is located in a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among its assets, it has the largest wind farm in Victoria, Waubra (192 MW), and manages the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll underground, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (Northern Link), is intended to connect the Western Toowong Highway to the peripheral route to Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 kilometres of tunnel.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tendering will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will start in December of next year.
Although this toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, construction is not expected to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work to Hochtief
Australia continues to make a big profit from Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned the government's contract worth 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure for the national fibre optic broadband network.
This will enable 400 000 people to have quick access to the Internet and provide employment for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the project to build the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, which has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the contract to build a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for a total of EUR 64.5 million.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after being entrusted with the work of enlarging the Bosruck tunnel in Austria for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction is planned for early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is being offered Renfe's ad.
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore, with a budget of around €3 million a year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month renewals each.Mrs. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that submitted to the Renfe call for proposals, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined 63 million for restricting competition
The French competition regulator fined France Télécom €63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to the institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by charging and by loyal consumer programmes on the margins of regulation.
The former French monopoly and state-owned enterprise has been fined more than €450 million since 1994 for its obstacles to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday was also increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore likely to be repeated.
A shop for applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed suit and opened an internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues not derived from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will take until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought in 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them third and fifth among the clubs that have earned the most money in the competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory but is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
The competition has awarded €5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the inception of the tournament in the 1992-93 season, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this division.
The White Club was the third on the continent to score the most money for his participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently the title holder and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
The top two teams in the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also paid the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that's despite losing to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country in the Champions League in terms of silver, although it has won more titles than any other country (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure implemented by UEFA.
For this year, the organisation chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1090 million from the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the qualifying matches (including Atletico Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million for being there, plus 550,000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus for the winner (€800,000) and the draw (€400,000 for each team) and the eighth-placed team receives three million each, while the eight teams in the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The final four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 million received by the other finalist.
For example, a club will earn at least 7.1 million on fixed payments and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça have amassed 2.5 million euros for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, which are 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportionate value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, with four seats attached.
The previous year's champion will take 40% of the money involved, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not require the undertaking to launch a public offer for acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be paid over 10 years and paid at a rate of 1% per annum for this deferral.
Last night Sos shares were down to €1.85; Nueva Rumasa's offer valued the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos's actual valuation.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders 15 days to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this were the case, the cash outflows would be 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible buy-in and legal offers from its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a management position in the food business.
This is a newly created position which will be directly dependent on the group chairman.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains engulfed in legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that Sos will reveal further misappropriations of funds in the coming months cannot be ruled out.
On the credit to the Salazars, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million without knowing where it was going.
The CNMV authorises the OPCW to exclude Paternina submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (NVC) yesterday authorised the OPA for exclusion submitted by Inversora Mer to Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory note presented sufficient following the amendments made on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, comprising 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It also explained that 5 592 778 million shares had been frozen and could not be transferred in any way before the tender was finalized, the price of which it stated had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the rules in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are taken to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage and the cost of repairs.
Each disaster is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex task.
Calculating the cost of a repair by hand, including parts and labour, between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, can take two or three hours.
However, with the help of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and service providers for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the Solera group in North America, is the leading company; 80% of estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company has 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult task, since each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price recorded.
In addition, a graphical image of each model is drawn up which can be clicked on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a mass-selling model, the work can be done in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it may take three to four months.At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
For example, the most exclusive models have information on Porsche, but not on Ferrari or Lamborghini.
The number of vehicles in circulation is over 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres located throughout the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialised in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million a year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to use them differently and to offer a variety of products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing broken parts or for calculating the vehicle's venous or residual value.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
The products offered by Audatex make it easy to imagine the kind of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship being AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of claims, for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, the manufacturer's estimated repair times or painting time shall be taken into account.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers who use it only a little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of experiments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it has left the assembly line, only by means of its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an internet service provider open to the professional sector that allows auctions on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or learning about current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious damage over a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company devoted to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official parts, prices and manufacturer's timetables.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of accidents, failures or maintenance.
The GT evaluation guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per annum over the past three years, and it had turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it started its process of internationalisation, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will receive €19.1 million, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera was listed at $1 billion; today, its shares are valued at a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a component of Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auctions for accidental cars
In October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of disaster-prone cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased to the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to operate.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages over 650 000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently over 1500 registered sellers and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It handles 3,000 ads a day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed may no longer be used, but parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Collector cars can be re-registered, even if they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Four-stage garage conversion
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user obtains a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, find the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 all-terrain vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer and an Internet connection are required to use it.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, an actual graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or reductions, and then print the quote to deliver it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be borrowed.
Audatex is currently working on making these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very keen on, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inside.
