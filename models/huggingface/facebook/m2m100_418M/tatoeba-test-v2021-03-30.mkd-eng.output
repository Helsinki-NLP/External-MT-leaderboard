Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I stopped smoking.
I know how it sounds.
Tom seemed not to stop him sitting alone.
I feel much better now.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be.
I am hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn’t want them to see me.
It’s bad that the concrete doesn’t burn.
Why does Tom do this?
Tom stood suddenly.
My father brought me here when I was young.
What a bubble.
Leave the bottle.
I’ll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to silence.
I am crazy.

We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can’t see them.
Tom did not eat.
There is someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn’t read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I don’t give up now.
The room is full.
I released her.
Don’t be bright.
I can’t open the weight.
This was the idea of Tom.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom could not resist.
Tom is still disappointed.
Do people really hate each other?
I did not hear.
Mary laughed.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought about.
It doesn’t bother me to wait here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
This is not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You understand?
I couldn’t help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You won’t succeed.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know you would do everything for your red eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom lies on the ice.
I will never capitulate.
I hope you are ready for a challenge.
Tom liked that idea.
This is the first night I see this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did he release us?
I was home last night.

You can study here.
Tom was not told why Mary was not there.
Tom has fixed it.
Tom throwed the shot.
It is not coconut.
I am not safe here.
To my great sadness, Mary came to the party in a blonde dress.
I will tell you what you want.
I hope it is useful.
Don’t mention anything.
The worst type of mammal is the emotional mammal.
Let us get worse.

You have brought them here immediately.
Tom lives abroad.
Are they working here?
Tom's eyes were bright when Mary wrapped in the room.
I am relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
It may take a long time before you see me again.
He sat next to the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be miserable.
That doesn’t seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.

Could you get my shooter out of my foot?
I have forgotten how smart you know.
Can I see her?
The money is not just water.
We do not hide anything.
I just didn’t think.
I am not quite convinced.
Let us put an end to this.
I have told you a million times that you should not exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come to.
The book is heavy.
Why should we find it?
I tell you to be careful.
Tom always lies to me.
The rooms in the hotel obviously very badly stumbling sounds. I hear how he in the neighboring room swallowed mastic!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We will be good.
Walk through the market.
Try to be optimistic.
You obviously have romantic feelings to Tom.
I can’t find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Do you hurt me?
Please talk to me.

I am reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It finished work.
These cows are flattered.
Tom went to fishing.
Tom did not think for a moment to try to convince Mary to do that.
Let’s go to the shopping center.
Let us celebrate.
I didn’t play Monopoly from college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we are relatives.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pencil?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It is not the reverse.
Tom is sleeping hard.
Be smart and don’t tell yours about it.
