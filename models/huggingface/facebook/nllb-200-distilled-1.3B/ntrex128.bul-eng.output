Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried they're looking like muppets.
Some of the Assembly members are stunned by the proposal to change their title to CUP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the entire political spectrum are worried that this could become a laughing stock.
One of the Labour MPs has expressed concern that his group is concerned that the new name rhymes with "Tup and Butt".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party indicated that his group was not biased towards the name change, but noted that the new name of the CPC (in English  MWP) bore a certain verbal resemblance to mpet.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently drafting the bill to change the name, made the following statement: It is understood that the final decision on all descriptive names used to refer to the members of the Assembly will be made by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found broad support for the Assembly to be renamed the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As regards the role of its members, the Commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament, or MPs for short, but the MPs have received the most support after a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative options, but reaching consensus is likely to be a headache for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the amendment bill within weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of its members, as well as the very design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will have the final say on what they will be called when they come to debate the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has an administrative region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the country's name change, has said he will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the country is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing in Harlem's churches.
"If you look at the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church on literally every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today, they're both missing.
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways", he adds.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone gathers regularly.
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will be in the same situation.
The man adds that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks where people live that do not help the survival of the other shrines in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people buying housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will be attending them
Both churches were built by white herdsmen before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin's was taken over by black Christians led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they didn't want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan for its restoration, and they ordered the bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to the St. Martin's, proudly calls them the Poor Bell.
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "indispensable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell system in the world that was used by a black musician  Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the larger system at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentioned that he's never been replaced since St. Martin.
What has unfolded at St. Martin's over the past few weeks has been a complex tale, weaved by architects and contractors, some brought in by the secular leaders of the church and others from the episcopal diocese.
The vestry  which is the governing body of the congregation, consisting of secular leaders  wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese  would be inclined to pass on the expenses of the vestry, although it had no role in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while hunting lobster in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and rushed in with a group to get him out of the water.
Hummel first thought the kid had caught a lobster and got excited, then realized he was screaming "He bit me!"
He bit me!
Hummel says that when he reached the boy, he realized that the entire area of his collarbone had been torn.
"I've asked everyone to get out of the water because there's a shark!" adds Hummel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It's still unclear what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescue captain Larry Gills told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not a dangerous species.
Gills adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
The authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Gills notes that the area has more than 135 species of sharks, but most of them pose no threat to humans.
Sainsbury's planning an offensive on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty stalls in its stores where customers will be served by dedicated assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty market, which is valued at £2.8 billion and continues to grow while sales of fashion and home products are declining, the largest ever beauty stands will be located in 11 stores across the country, followed by more if the initiative is successful.
The investment shift in the beauty industry comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free shelf space recently taken up by TVs, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will double its beauty line to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, similar to the offerings in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up range so that most products can be used by vegans  something increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing discount programs at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on buying smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times means that supermarkets have to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has Argos locations in hundreds of stores, and has also opened Habitats locations since buying both chains two years ago, which the company claims has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to redesign its cosmetics and pharmaceutical facilities was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's did a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's supermarket operations.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sold its 281-site pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, made the following statement: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty stands to improve the overall experience for our customers.
We've also invested in special training for our colleagues to provide professional advice on site.
Our range of brands aims to satisfy every taste and every need in a captivating setting with a convenient location, making us an attractive beauty destination that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby turned down an £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby scrapped an £11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly appliances and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star Peter Jones to simmer after withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was enraged when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant there would be no more time for his Truly brand of home products and accessories.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, with rumors that it has doubled the fortune of Willoughby, whose estimated worth is £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on a plane to head to one of her holiday properties.
One of the sources shared the following: "Truly was definitely Holly's top priority.
It was expected to be a long-term commitment that would secure her future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave made absolutely everyone completely unprepared.
No one believed it could happen on a Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow that's full of products waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the Today presenter, one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and could also delay the launch of the brand.
And last but not least, it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby herself co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, who is 52, joining as the company's chairman in March.
The two families often vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will also replace Anne McParlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity...
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Tough negotiations leading to warming relations
He joked about the criticism he would face from news outlets for making a comment that some would consider "unsuitable for the president" and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump back down so much?
Trump responded in his jokingly newsworthy way.
I'm not giving up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was heralded by Trump as a "big step toward the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But negotiations to eliminate the weapon are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal attitude" from the United States to his country's first steps on the path to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things in his speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful", he noted.
We were heading for war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: halting missile tests, releasing hostages and returning home the bodies of American servicemen.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiating with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was forced to flee their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be initiated.
Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unequivocal view that no international help is needed, which makes things a bit challenging, says Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The National Disaster Agency spokesperson, Mr. Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country remains unprepared for this kind of natural disaster.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on the rest of the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palo probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best of conditions, transportation between Indonesia's many islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
A hospital ship recently stationed in Lombok to serve earthquake victims has been heading to Palo, but it will be at least three days before it reaches the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's backward infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, investing heavily in roads and railways.
But insufficient funds plagued his cabinet constantly as Joko again headed to the polls the following year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with clubs, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge has brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jordon Shakiri about 27-28 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team trailed 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot, then fired a precision shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed for the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the plunger Kepa Arisabalaga and became irreparably entangled in the net.
"I tried to get a good position to control the ball because players like Shaq always look for passes in front positions, so I just tried to buy as much time as possible for a good shot to the goal", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante give up, I pushed my ball and I just shot without thinking too much.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the 25th minute after a goal from their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward gave up a header to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from midfield to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged a quick double in the center.
Then he fired a quick pass to put Azar in a clear position on the penalty area.
Azar ran over the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 this Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be the UEFA Europa League video game at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Many people are trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, news conference spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported.
The city of Palo, with a population of over 380,000, is littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for the cooperation of anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I beg anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something with their dash cameras, to contact us as they may have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who believe the woman is an acquaintance arrived at the scene and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, with police saying they are currently notifying the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but was notified by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man was silent when he heard what had happened.
Residents have been told it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
One of the officers reported to a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She keeps saying "this is so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans crossed the cordon while another van was left outside.
There are police officers stationed in the cordon to guard the block.
Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, dial 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30th.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament is becoming the latest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Its ban would be poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Society, said the following: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's statue to the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconic battles of the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph the following: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more so in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable figure who represents one side of the resulting divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of note and celebration.
A pig killer fatally wounds a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a slumber in Liupanshui market in Guangzhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into his pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, also leaving the door to the next shack open.
He also reported a large male pig with a bloody snout in the barn.
The forensic examiner confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer, killing him, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and disfigured", said cousin Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on a Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it could not attack anyone else while police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and the market management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although rare, pigs have been reported to attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had chained a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger" to them.
They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not intent on hurting anyone.
But you also have to treat them with respect", he concludes.
The weakening of Hurricane Rosa will bring frequent and heavy rains to the southwestern United States.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Sunday morning Eastern Time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the cyclone begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to some parts of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the tropical moisture along with the approaching cyclone will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, washed away debris streams and possible desert landslides.
The deep tropical damp will cause two to three inches of rainfall per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
Flash floods are possible in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel handfuls of miles in the desert when the threat of tropical rains is imminent.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring up dust and gale-force winds.
The approaching cyclone will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
It's possible to get rainfall of over half an inch, which will lead to carried small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
Late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before rain covers a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October could bring huge temperature swings across the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start to October, with temperatures in the 80s expected to dominate from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued as the networks cut their regular programming for a last-minute reversal on Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that would have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Cavanaugh had drunkenly groped her and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely adamant that nothing like this has ever happened.
This is probably even more than the Nielsen report of 20.4 million viewers watching the Friday broadcast.
The company has counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no directly available data on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also traditionally has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch from their workplaces.
By comparison, we're talking about an audience the size of a football game or a Hollywood awards show.
Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, topped the ratings with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had a turnover of  3,1 million, NBC  2,94 million, MSNBC  2,89 million and CNN  2,52 million.
Interest has remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After a moderate Republican walked out of his office declaring he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him being booed by protesters on Friday as he tried to catch an elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
During the entire ordeal, for several minutes, he never even looked up from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's presenting the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless", the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already left with a statement and before the elevator doors closed he announced that he would make further statements during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided heavy live coverage hours later as the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake has said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, as the opposition Democrats are demanding.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators, Flake made a decision.
His election was definitely crucial, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her, published on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "queen-game plan" for Brexit, suggesting that collecting customs duties from Britain for the EU and vice versa is "utterly absurd".
Police arrested suspect Detian Simpson in the death of LSU quarterback
Police have arrested a suspect in the recent fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Detian Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Officers found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, police announced that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
His bail has been set at $350,000, Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, which stated the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Search Unit, the Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their assistance in the investigation that led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva thanks local law enforcement for the "immediate justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 point guard grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shaken and in shock" by Wade's death.
Wade said that's something that worries a person all the time.
A volcano is scattering ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The Centre has recorded multiple tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Hoquiquilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed in by the gendarmerie, began throwing eggs and paint on the peacekeepers, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, other clashes with police broke out, with the officers resorting to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while those who declared themselves in favor of preserving the country's integrity responded with "Spain forever".
Local media reported that as a result of the protests, 14 people received medical treatment for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region even a year after an October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted whether to vote for independence, although turnout was low as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the polling stations in the region in a series of violent clashes.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration nevertheless took place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has any hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now it seems we are at a standstill", the man added.
Despite a major, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan political parties are struggling this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in jail awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pugh, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that he's getting more and more tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders arrested pending a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
He claims that my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and repression we are seeing from the Spanish government.
Londoners: men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car slammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30pm UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings reports damage to the gate and the building.
It's also possible the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal brings the Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the win.
Major League rookie Livingston has surprised Rangers, inflicting just the second loss to Steven Gerrard in his first 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team tied for second place in the standings with Hibernian.
Gerard's side remain unbeaten away from home in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday face leader Hearts, who they are eight points behind in the standings.
But before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is now in a six-game unbeaten streak in the league, and manager Holt still hasn't tasted the loss since he took over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the hopeless guests.
Holt's team needed to lead the score long before he scored, and his straightforward style of play made it extremely difficult for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his shot went sideways, then Alan Lithgow shot past the beam after Craig Halkett returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing they could seriously hinder the visitors from static positions.
And that's how he got the winning goal.
Rangers committed a foul and Livingston played well as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to take out Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
By this point, the Rangers had more ball control, but they were faced with the impenetrable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
Rangers' goalie saved with a kick from Scott Pittman, and a head kick from Littlelow went past the goal after another static for Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was raining centers, but they were easily cleared, and the referee twice disregarded the guests' claims to the puck  first after a duel between Halkett and reserve Glenn Middleton, and then when there was doubt about a hand game.
This is a phenomenal analysis by Livingston.
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays simply brilliantly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and the lineup have been virtually unchanged since the team's return to the Major Leagues, but Holt deserves a lot of credit for the way he has transformed the team since his appointment.
He has some real heroes on the field.
Captain Halkett was incredible, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under constant pressure.
Meanwhile, the Rangers have shown nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were far below that standard.
They missed the last pass before the goal, only once managed to split the home defense  this loss should wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, we witnessed smiles and blue spaces as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cooling due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but nonetheless, many supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the rift caused by one visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a tyrant by others.
Cyclist rests after collision with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The crash happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at around 10:15am British time.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the cyclist died at the scene.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located less than a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that their officers are working to identify the man and will notify his family.
The road is closed and bus routes are diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons reports.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at around 0930 British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
To contain it, special officers from the "Tordano" squad have been called in to deal with eight prisoners, as the mutiny itself is confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor facial injuries and received medical attention at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman issued the following statement: "Specially trained personnel have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards have been given medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we make it very clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, with the possibility of their sentences being extended.
Long Lartin Prison has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after an inmate was attacked.
Also last October, riot police were called to the prison to quell a major riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
It's rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but it's likely to happen early next week as the weakened Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already established flash flood watch posts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain likely late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts from the National Hurricane Center are for 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of precipitation possible in some places.
For those not at risk of flash flooding, the pink rain may actually be a blessing, as the region is badly affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some rain is likely to be helpful as the southwest is currently dry.
According to the U.S. Commission on Dry Seasons, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, the second-worst category, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still boasts a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakening.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
Summary rainfall of up to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The primary risk from Rosa or its aftermath is extreme rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States, the National Hurricane Center warns.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and waste streams in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 0400 hours British time on Saturday.
He's been admitted to a hospital where his condition remains stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to contact them.
Trump says Cavanaugh has suffered from the mean and angry Democratic Party.
"Any vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh "suffered the wrath and malice" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, flatly rejecting the accusation that Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford is also testifying during the prosecution's hearing.
The president issued a statement Saturday saying that today the American people witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favor of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation for public service", the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly targeted Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the general election.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our time.
"Even though I'm not a candidate, I'm actually in it", Trump continued.
That's why I'm out there fighting for the good candidates.
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves the mission of "distracting and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Cavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican aide told CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people have died after many were swept away by giant waves as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday when in the evening waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept the coast, carrying many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, causing many to fall victim to the disaster", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB Disaster Management Agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The water had washed away cars, trees, entire houses, hit everything in its path", Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees and managed to escape the water", he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, torn down and twisted bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Secondary tremors continued to roil the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) released a statement that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The declaration also mentioned that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be higher on the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter.
He also added that "communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, for its part, said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers were already on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for not reporting the tsunami that hit Palo, although officials explained that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building shouting panicked warnings of an approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Within minutes, a huge wall of water slammed into the shore, washing away cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages, cutting off communications around Palu and making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes to help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has now reached over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found refuge in canvas shelters hung in the yard of their office, they passed a series of scenes of devastation, says Mr. Doseba.
They told me they saw countless destroyed houses.
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the rescue and recovery efforts of emergency teams, some complain that experienced foreign rescuers are being prevented from reaching Palo.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at a regional level", said Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government declares a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they haven't declared it yet".
As the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami falls over Palo, the friends and families of those still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived the disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championships, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue markings, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered", he added.
Thieves steal $26,750 while loading an ATM in Newport, R.I.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was loading an ATM in Newport on Levi's, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement park and was preparing to load it with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While the man was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, the report continues, but police did not say how many were involved in the robbery.
Anyone with information about the identities of the suspects should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Along with the change's announcement on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: The man officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and is using it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who left "for emotional reasons", the show's creator tells us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe that 'J' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you,'" West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it is us.
It went from Kanya, which means one person, to just Ye, which is a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
The rapper is one of many celebrities in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and aliases, including Puff Daddy, Pee Dee, or Dee Dee, but this year he announced his preference for the aliases Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's former collaborators, Jay-Z, also introduced himself in a variant with or without dashes and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico vows never to use the military against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as left-wing student movements gradually spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI development.
As China becomes increasingly active on the AI front, the United States should double its research budget in this area, says AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various elements of the US government made statements on the topic of AI, although the US generally does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: to become the number one AI innovator by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI development would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and have yet to make further breakthroughs in terms of AI, Lee said.
Doubling funding could also double the chances that the next big breakthrough in AI will come from the US, as Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Li, whose book "The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies  Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie, Mellon Lee worked on an AI system that beat America's most successful hotelo player, then he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee paid tribute to the federal government's previous technology competitions, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be, which would help identify the new visionaries.
"Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government funding", Lee said.
"China is not taking academic leaders, but corporations", the man claims.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy can help the US strengthen its AI program.
"I think that PhDs in AI should be automatically given green cards", the man says.
The US State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence that aims to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing over $100 million a year in AI development.
Meanwhile, the US legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not seen any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a region called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territorial integrity and therefore vetoes its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Georgy Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum himself, while a boycott campaign casts doubt on whether the referendum will reach the minimum 50 percent required to be recognized as valid.
The question on the ballot says: Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the post-Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they will abide by the result to such an extent that the vote now carries decisive weight.
To change the name of the state, it must be approved by two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The State Election Commission has reported that as of 1 p.m. there have been no reports of irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gyosse Taniewski, a 62-year-old from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was setting up a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents, which were pulled up by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, not through the door of servants", Kavadarkov said.
Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring Macedonia the necessary investment, as the unemployment rate in the country is over 20 percent.
'I believe the vast majority will be with us, as over 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO', Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The head of state also said that a positive result would lead to the "confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published a poll showing that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum  which is below the required activity.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote "Yes".
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would represent the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes through all of Brighton's defence and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defence to bring Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's 65th-minute goal seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He overtook three Brighton defenders before sprinting the ball into the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left the others behind at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he threw a left to Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball with a single touch to Aguero, who with a right-footed shot overtook Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his goal.
"Aguero is battling some injuries to his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We planned on him playing for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal right then.
But it was Sterling who secured the initial lead for the Sky Devils in that Premier League game.
He signed off in the 29th minute.
In the goal situation Aguero got a pass deep into Brighton's half.
He immediately threw a left-footed pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane went forward with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The Ravens' forward got a close shot just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55pm on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
With the Nationals not making the playoffs, there's no point in another game for a starting pitcher.
And yet the ever-ambitious Scherzer hopes to be the starter on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies if the game matters for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild card spot in the wild card game after a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but it's still not certain they'll win their first division title.
"While we ourselves are not fighting for anything, "we want to end the season with a good game in Denver, "where the fans and the other team will do their best to win what may be their most important game of the year.
Why would I want to miss a game like this?
The Nationals have not yet named a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it's speculated that they'll allow Scherzer to participate if the game is decided.
For Scherzer, it would have been his 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he had practice on Thursday and would have had a normal rest period through Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is gaining support in West Virginia.
President Koso alluded to the situation with his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
In November, everything we've achieved will be at risk.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the greatest moments in current history. I also state that while I am not a candidate, I am actually a participant, which is why I am fighting hard for the right candidates.
And then he goes on to say, "You all see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you are witnesses to their ruthlessness, to their malice.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to get hold of power and governance, because they only care about power and governance, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, in the words of the president, have set themselves the goal of "distracting and obstructing".
"What we've all seen in the last four days", he continued, calling the Democrats angry, nasty, mean and disloyal.
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which drew a loud cheer from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting. That was a really bad gesture. Maybe the worst I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer broad-minded.
The Party has no tolerance for those who speak openly
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last Labour MP to be told he is not welcome just for speaking frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly because she has been a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those Jeremy disagreed with under previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, Friday meetings have been just that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and the promises of a 'light and moderate' policy have long been forgotten, if ever on the agenda.
It was becoming increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on how much it was liked by the leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I had previously worked for who I thought shared similar political views began to expect me to make a turnaround and take positions that I would never agree with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make a public speech, no matter what I actually say, there's a whole offensive tirade on social media, calling for a retraction, a rejection of moderate politics, claims that I don't belong to Labour.
It's not just me who's been through this.
In fact, I know I even had better luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are at least mostly political in nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face sexist or racist slurs every day without being intimidated by them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how these kinds of insults have become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is far from broad-minded, with any sign of distrust or change in the electoral rules becoming narrower.
Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice to keep my mouth shut, to keep my mouth shut, and then everything will be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government, which through its neglect led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country goes into Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political ouster will deter me from acting in the way I believe best to protect your interests.
Chrisley Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
The Invincibles are in the lead.
The two late tries may have changed the final score slightly, but there's no doubt that Eyre deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
The team is already leading the standings and the only one of the ten teams is undefeated so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved crucial in a game that coach Peter Murczy and his team can be very pleased with.
"I'm happy because the other teams have been testing us very hard in the last few games and we are still unbeaten", Murchi said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their position better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute free kick followed by a successful extra kick from Frazier Klimo took Air forward in the score, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up in the score after Jason Bagot made an extra kick followed by a failed extra kick.
Klimt extended the lead for Eyre from a penalty kick just before halftime, scoring an ace after a solo action and then completing the extra kick, making the score 17-5 for Eyre at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's ace followed by Baggott's successful extra point cut the lead to just five points.
A prolonged suspension of play followed due to a serious injury to Ruid Not, who was carried on a stretcher, and after the resumption of the match, Air increased their lead after an essay by Stafford McDowall and a successful extra kick by Klimos.
Then, the current Air Captain Blair McPherson was given a yellow card and the Melrose again used their numerical advantage to put pressure on the team and scored an ace through Bruce Colvin followed by a failed extra-base hit.
However, the hosts regained their presence of mind and when Strawan Hutchinson was given a yellow card after knocking out Climo without a ball, from the ensuing penalty shoot-out, McPherson scored an ace with the help of the advancing offensive line of Eyre.
Klimo made the extra run, and it wasn't long before he did it again after Kyle Rowe caught a kicked-off ball from David Armstrong and brought winger Gregor Henry to the flank for the hosts' fifth ace.
The star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kearnan seems to have turned to a more direct and warm industry after it was revealed he was appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he also wrote and co-stars in alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's last, as it appears that Kearnan is already planning her life after Craigslist.
According to the official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kearnan was planning to join Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors are constantly patrolling the rigged naval headquarters at La Paz.
The flag is a blue flag that flies over public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "The sea is ours by right".
It's our duty to get it back.
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet handed to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive  as is the call to sail the Pacific again.
In fact, that hope is now the strongest it has been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Strength is in Bolivia, there is a sense of cheerfulness and unity everywhere, as the country looks forward to a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadala.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is set to head into a contentious re-election battle next year, also placed a huge stake in the court's ruling on Monday.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean", Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the chances of the court ruling in favor of Bolivia are very slim, and even if it did, it would not change things in reality.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to take over Chilean territory and has decided not to determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's ruling comes only six months after the last arguments were heard shows that the case is "not complicated", answers Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt it.
"The problem of access to the ocean was inflated by the current Bolivian government", Zarate says.
Then he implied that Morales' bellicose rhetoric had wiped out what little goodwill Chile had left.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point resume negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to have a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was being made unusually quickly.
He said that on Monday Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open a new era in its relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by achieving mutual benefits".
Calzada also rejected the idea that Morales  who continues to be one of Latin America's most popular presidents  used the issue of access to the ocean as a political grid.
'Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.
North Korea says it will not proceed with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri made his speech Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing sides in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of re-launching deadlocked diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri called the idea of continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War "empty hope" that would make the North fall to its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant move toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest in massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores near you.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block out the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which have stunned the runway during Paris Fashion Week.
The rather impractical hats caused an Instagram buzz this summer, with designers sending out their flashy creations to shock the fashion community.
Valentino's signature design was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide brim that literally swallowed the models' heads.
Other very large accessories included jewelled pumpkins, a magic hat and even pineapple... but they're not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had lip seams and were reminiscent not so much of high fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a full-size scuba gear with a snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're into fashion trends like this, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that giant hats will soon be available in fashion stores near you.
The giant hats come just short of the "La Bomb" straw hat with a two-foot rim that was seen on the heads of everyone from Riana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that has taken over social media has led to the emergence of another huge design on the fashion runway: a straw beach bag almost as big as the wearer wearing a swimsuit.
The orange-blue raffia bag, with its raffia eyelashes and a white leather handle, was the all-seeing item in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer. After the designer made such an impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another outstanding performance in test scores, only reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association (SCIS), strive to offer the best possible standard to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen careers and their place in a global world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said this: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, your words reach them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with the people of other countries.
We see from this year's test results that languages are the top performers for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students achieved A's in Chinese, with 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students achieving the same score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice for students are given the same treatment as natural and mathematical disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) both in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17% of employers cited insufficient language skills as a reason for their difficulty in recruiting.
Therefore, the knowledge of foreign languages is increasingly becoming a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require foreign language proficiency, making these skills essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you master a foreign language, you will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill that will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person one step ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to conduct a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reached double-digit percentages at 15%.
That's why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding good jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being experts in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, there is no denying that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires that they be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should really be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellence, to young people in Scotland.
It's the right thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Association.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are excited to see LeBron James' first game against the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the team's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play in the match.
"He'll be on the field between one and 48 minutes", joking Walton announced via the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned rallies for Trump, which include stops at popular sites, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the confirmation vote for his choice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is aiming to bolster the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November ballot.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 pm Eastern time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below via the live YouTube feed.
Trump will likely consider this week's hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been plagued by sexual misconduct allegations that have held up the Senate confirmation vote for a week while an FBI investigation is ongoing.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans build momentum for the November election.
So the campaign of President Donald Trump announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are entering a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, declining to be named.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring in fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit this month will take place to West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA will fight to the end, keeping their hopes alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three straight sessions without any intrigue, the Sunday afternoon games may have brought what the Ryder Cup needed.
The shift in the advantage in sports is a pretty subjective concept, but one that players believe in wholeheartedly, especially in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They were up by six points, now it's down to four, so I guess we've gained some momentum", Jordan Speight said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead with only 12 points left to be awarded.
But as Speight says, the Americans have more to show for it and their fans should not lose hope, judging by the athleticism of Speight and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four possible points.
Speight is in excellent form from the start to the end of every hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers from the fans grew louder as he advanced into the round where he made a precision shot to even the score in Game 4, after he and Thomas were two shots behind the first two holes.
His game-winning shot on the 15th hole was met with a strong reaction that makes us believe that all is not lost for the American team.
"The important thing is to think of nothing else and focus on your own match", says Speight.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to remember.
The only players with more points than Speight and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe, won four out of four and seem to be getting everything right.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who didn't make "God" on Sunday afternoons, but they also didn't make "Rich" on Saturday mornings or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, and the way that energy seemed to flow between them and the enthusiastic fans, cemented the opinion that they were the players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari to bring a potential victory to Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The tales of European glory, however, proved a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly took on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball games, while he was partnered with Alex Noren.
Goals and two doubles on the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in trouble they couldn't handle.
But in Sunday games, there's no way anyone else is gonna solve your problems.
Fourball and foursome matches are extremely interesting to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can change at any moment.
The Europeans were playing better as a team and so they had a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "four-out" matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last - something that many people, especially in the US, were very suspicious of.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the United States 10-6 after Saturday's Four-ball and Four-Sum matches.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have started with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, taking their lead in the Le Golf National competition to four points.
In an attempt to win back the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning fours against the Americans who made mistake after mistake, and in the end Europe won the series 3-1.
The USA put up more of a fight in the Foursome matches, where they won two games but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie from Europe to score four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend, became just the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After outplaying Woods and Patrick Reid in the four-ball match, they were highly motivated to beat the fractured Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambe by an even more decisive score of 5 & 4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, has only occasionally shown flashes of genius, but so far he has 19 losses from 29 games in the Foursquare and Foursquare matches, plus a total of seven straight losses.
Justin Rose, who has taken a break from the morning's four-ball games, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the four-ball clashes in a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koppka, respectively world number one and number three.
However, the European team was unable to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and clear day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas have restored hope for the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult 2§1 win over Spain's John Ram and Jan Polter in the Foursomes matches, and later came back to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the Foursomes matches, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team made up a four-point deficit before the singles, and by the rules of the game, Furyk's team will keep the trophy even if there's a tie.
However, having been outplayed on two consecutive days, their chances of a comeback on Sunday seem not to be very good.
North Korea says there's no way they can disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening mistrust of the United States and there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual general assembly of the world organization, Ri Yong-ho said that "significant goodwill measures" have been taken over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site, and pledging to not spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we will not have confidence in our own national security and under no circumstances can we disarm first unilaterally.
While Ri expressed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "staged" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps, his statement seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump gave assurances for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on "first eliminating nuclear weapons" and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust".
Ri did not say whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, as the US leader stressed at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the side on the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles at the US mainland was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea eliminates its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved.
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, but within hours North Korea accused him of making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of caffeinated all-nighter learning.
A professor found that students at the world's number one university often do not even think about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he spoke about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how poor sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of a good bedtime routine.
In another section, participants discuss how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know  just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke, added Prof. Keisler.
The culture of pride in studying all night is still there, he says, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Providing enough quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even to avoid becoming fat, since sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keisler prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says the course was an eye opener and inspired him to spread it throughout campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competing institution.
Professor Keisler recommends that students consider setting bedtime and wake-up alarms and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Menga's goal has crushed Gerard's team.
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerrard's scoreless team and brought a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first ever away win since a 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side suffered only Gerrard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind the struggling Hearts, Ladbrokes' Premier League leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers, lacking in constructive ideas, at no point seemed close to a tie.
After the match, Rangers have slipped to sixth place and Livingston are now third, trailing second Hibernian by just a goal.
There may be additional problems for the Rangers as sideman Callum Spence sustained a head injury after being struck with an object that was apparently thrown by the visitors' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that beat Ayr in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same scoring 11 that Livingston pulled off against Hearts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team parried all the action of the opponent.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but the Livingstons have done better on the rarer occasions when they've had possession.
They should have scored in the second minute when Menga took a touchdown to put Scott Pittman on goal for Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a good opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs' later foul centering found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow deflected the ball to the side of the back beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have a shot in the 15th minute when he faced Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
Rangers only had two accurate shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly handled Lasana Kulibally's header and Ovi Ejaria's weak shot easily.
Although Levy's 34th-minute goal was surprising in terms of possession, it was totally deserved.
The Rangers again failed to handle Jacobs' deep center field.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who passed it in cold blood to Menga, who was easy to score.
Gerard responded to the break by swapping Culiballi for Ryan Kent and this swap almost immediately resulted in the wing passing to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the shot.
However, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play in a home-court style of play, with Lithgow and Halkett continually deflecting forward-thrown long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor managed to get Jacobs' shot, and in the next corner, Lithgow shot head-first past the beam.
Rangers' backup Glenn Middleton asked for a late-inning punch after a one-on-one with Jacobs, but Thompson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
Page from our Sunday Morning yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science ever since, the Geiger counter became a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, was released.
Man: What in God's name is that?
It's a Geiger counter and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released in the radioactivity in the minerals.
It sure does matter right now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to see foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to see foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory
Then they can see a protein that's common to many cancers and inject it back into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains her immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear in over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and training them to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump wearing a hat that read "Let's Make America Great Again" on his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing a meaningless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat that read "Let's Make America Great Again", he spoke out against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL kicked off the show with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blaze Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's performance was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
And West complained to the audience that he had some problems backstage with his hat.
I've been harassed behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat".
I've been harassed!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?" saying he's going to wear a Superman suit because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
The comments prompted at least two public whistles, and SNL staff members appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one saying: "The whole studio went silent".
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West stunned many by performing the song "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of "Perierieri".
West was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: Thank you for standing up to the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just being himself and that's great.
But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe welcomes and promotes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
"We are like that", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to Kenny West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Dee.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.

A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Magistrates Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as sword wielding Jon Snow in the violent HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that playing such roles on screen often leads young people to think they have to be "tough" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something has gone wrong" and asked how we can address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels "firmly" that this problem needs to be addressed.
"Right now, I'm personally firmly convinced what we've got wrong with masculinity", he said.
What are we teaching young men about the problem we see now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel that they have to become this particular type of man?
I think this really is one of the big questions of our time, how do we change it?
Because obviously something is wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in the prequel or sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, claiming that he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in a reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that's how he gave me my future family and defined my life going forward", he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spine.
According to the country's health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40 000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, each year the number of people living with HIV and spina bifida in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in KGB communities is widespread.
Studies show that because of conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sexual relations with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of disease transmission are the result of poor protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies any leaks of Republican Senate records, denounces "dangerous lies and conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican state senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and ultra-right wing websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of state senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely untrue and is an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The member of my team whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There is poison in this denial", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests she doesn't have the temperament of a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't be so defiant.
I'm not supposed to question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and balanced.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for Waters's seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Mostly, if it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office has referred the allegations to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement.
'We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed', she continued, 'and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.'
Johnny English reviews are exploding again. The weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It's now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every new British film, and it seems that this is also true of the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise about Johnny English that started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will self-deprecation and facial expressions that say how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English with his squinting eyes and his "humanoid" face has permission to do it again, his name being the most important when it comes to a great comedy piece for non-English-speaking movie fans.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamour, possesses a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a lot of the man who contributed a note to the theme music Chariots of Fire for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It was also originally based on the chaotic traveller and international man played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last Johnny English movie had a good moment or two.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and for a moment the wings stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather weak and strangely redundant, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible incorporate a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and Johnny English's crazy crashes don't seem to me to be innovative or focused, because Actonson's no play reminds me of Mr. Bean.
The always relevant premise is that Britain is facing serious problems.
A hacker hacked into Britain's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the operatives for the terror agent on duty -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the PM, who is a pompous and self-aware figure and is already suffering a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is giving her all for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she should call in a retired agent, since all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a fancy centre, but who is also teaching undercover agent lessons: here are some good shots when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is called to Whitehall for emergency briefing and is reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a hilarious role that's a little bit of a waste of Vicky Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's Secret Service and face off against the fatal beauty Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Beau begin their odyssey of farces: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a French restaurant; creating chaos when they sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English provoking a veritable anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to explore the interior of Volta's house.
All the laughs are definitely taken from the previous movie, but since they're so cute and raucous, there's a lot more content here for kids.
It's a pretty mediocre production.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: Couldn't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that they've developed a plan to make the British work four days a week but get paid five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to make British people work four days a week but get paid for five.
The party claims it wants company bosses to provide the savings made by revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them one more day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fit the economic agenda and the party's plans to shake the country in favor of workers".
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen right away, but the four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits into the approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party won't be the first to have this idea, the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during their general election campaign in 2017.
At present, however, this is not the aim of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not in the party's policy, it is not in the party's thinking".
Shadow Chancellor John Macdonell used last week's Labour conference to reveal his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the "impersonal directors" and "speculators" of the utility companies.
The chancellor's shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose a restraining order based on the violations found.
He also confirmed plans to bring workers onto company boards and set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy discussed 60 minutes ago whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could cause some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more forthcoming than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
When I went to the hearing, I talked to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, categorical and unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change that opinion, we need a shocking indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this:
And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive lineup of performers and fulfills an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the great lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also learn about the true purpose of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a number of tasks or 'actions', such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness of their goal to eradicate poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years before he achieved his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "collectivism" where people think they're doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million actions from supporters, who have been pushing for a variety of causes.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the financial situation of the group.
The group estimates that the funds have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the 'Power of Nutrition', a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to 'Helping children reach their full potential', which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from global citizens.
With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a simple historical record, said The Power of Food Ambassador Tracy Ullman to a live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, 'The Power of Nutrition', which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to a question from a NGO on its website asking: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen: It's going to be a long and hard road. We're going to fail sometimes and we're going to fail again.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year's New York City event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use naval forces to block and obstruct energy exports.
Washington could, if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia's involvement in Syria  specifically, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our Navy, ensure that sea lanes are open and if necessary block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market", he said.
Zink addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option with respect to Iraq and Russia is more or less a fuel incentive and substitution", he said, while also identifying Russia as a "pony number one", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcements come at a time when the Trump administration has a task to increase liquefied gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is "hostage to Berlin".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren expressed his judgment of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry deep down like Donald Trump does about our democracy", she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll conducted on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic Party officials discussed in terms of a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision in January, The Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSD to Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the recording in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after he returns is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers go home with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, hardened, and they come back wondering if they're going to get the respect that they and their brothers in arms have given to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman included in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a goodwill petition in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, has not been released.
She claims that her partner and the sons of violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The U.S. attorneys who are helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates that principle", the goodwill report says.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the report that a policy that denies immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to halt the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
'Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion', Sessions said in his 11 July policy statement.
The refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems  even not all the serious ones  that people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double in search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to salvage some of their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwyane Harris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, are being housed outside the Army Hospital in Palo, where patients are being treated outdoors due to the ongoing aftershocks.
Tears well up in his eyes as he recalls feeling the violent quake in the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
"I think I was trapped in the crumbling wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a state-run newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump cited a paid publication of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US congressional elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they are levelling import tariffs between the countries.
According to experts from the US and China at the beginning of the trade war, tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "is now doubling down on this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's respected tradition of free speech and press by running paid ads in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstad.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speech and you will not see a true reflection of the mixed opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article, though he did not specify which.
Republicans are pushing away women voters in the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh pogrom, analysts warn.
As many of the top Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over several sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the ballot box are extremely strong and most Republicans have already indicated they want to move forward with the vote.
These things can't be undone", Grant Raher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget tomorrow or in November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded", said news analyst Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say the problem is already serious; it's true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often don't vote because they don't like the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest a backlash could ensue if Republicans insist on confirming the nomination.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's about how the Republicans are handling it and how they're treating it", Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided over who to believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, leaning slightly more toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party during her time at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook.
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a venture that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the initiative.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own online personal data repository or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are accessible through any browser, and at the same time it's all of them at once.
The unique thing about online repositories is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted developers, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change or not when all their business models are completely revamped overnight.
We don't need their permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide power for commerce and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful force in the net neutrality debate.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
'I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the internet', added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
A centenary is being marked in the home town of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his medal-winning grandfather's work.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin in very thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire.
He later attacked the line of fire and with "incredible bravery" led the line forward before attacking an artillery piece with one hand and killing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918... just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Van laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was a "great honor" to be part of the parade, adding "the true hero's worth is shown by the support that will be given to many people".
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been waiting all night to watch the full Bellator 206 and you can't actually see the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was scheduled to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after staying up late, especially because of the fight.
A fan described the tweeting of the children's animated film as "some sort of sick joke".
"The government has ruled that at 6pm this content is inappropriate, so the program has been replaced with a children's show", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, in response to a question about the broadcast.
Peppa the pig, yes.
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they'll work on scheduling the meetings to engage UK viewers in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem", Cocker said.
But it's 6 a.m. on a Sunday, and there's no way to plan things so that here the event is on a Sunday and there it's on a Monday.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages, and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was government.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're sticking with five games instead of six as usual, and we tried to give the fans more room, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic water skier Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been hospitalized for several months.
On his first Laverne Daley show, he said he felt "less than everybody else" growing up because it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become an active LGBT campaigner and used his participation in this year's British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he did it because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to inspire hope in others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- it "surprised" him.
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but claims the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much when you're so young" He competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "It's hard to find someone your age who has had similar ups and downs".
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself says his whole worldview has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't going to be there for me, Dad, or in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment, when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn't invulnerable", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed of it all my life, jumping at the Olympics in front of the home crowd.
It also inspired his choice of his first song   Proud  by Heather Small  which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him cringe.

Missed form Mickelson remains on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back to his old form if he doesn't want his record to be tied to failure.
Mickelson, who is competing in the two-year-old event for a record 12th time, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for the Fourball and FourSum matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a mainstay on the U.S. team again, the five-time major championship winner spent his days as a fan and practicing his long-range blows in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old, who even at the peak of his career was never among the most straightforward players, is not in the best shape for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long, uneven course usually punishes any wrong shot.
And if the court itself isn't disturbing enough, in Game 9 on Sunday, Mickelson will face defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and looking to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are down by four points with 12 games left in the singles, get off to a strong start, it could be the decisive match for Mickelson.
Furyk expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly have said anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furik said.
He's confident in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he gave as much last week as he did this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everybody else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could end his Ryder Cup career, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured in numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and is a great guy for any team", he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is well aware that the great lead may soon be melted away.
Team Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows from personal experience that the big lead accumulated before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dane made his debut in Valderrama in 1997 when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros led by five points over the Americans, but just on the final right he was almost caught and barely managed to hold on to win by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn where we lost, and we won at Valderrama, but very hard", Björn said after the 2018 European Team won by 53 sessions on Friday and yesterday, giving him a 106 lead at Le Golf National.
So history must show me and everyone on this team that it's not over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you gotta do.
Nothing's over until you see the final scoreboard.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy and that's what we need to stay focused on.
I kept saying that I was only thinking about the 12 players on our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.
Satisfied with the players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never rush the celebrations.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on individual performances, and this is different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're out there alone, that's when you put your full capacity as a golfer to the test.
That's the message that we need to get to the players: You have to give your best tomorrow.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he too must give himself up to the end.
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing team's captain, Jim Furyk, will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the only exceptions being Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these big reverses on the last day -- he was part of the Brooklyn triumph -- and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, led his players on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd better make the same good start you saw at Brooklyn and Medina.
When the advantage shifts from one direction to the other, these middlegames are played under enormous tension.
So we've put our guys together and we've put our guys where we want them to be, so we can try to do the impossible tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter will face the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose these players in this order because I think that gives us the best chance of success", Björn said of his choice for singles.
Germany is once again delaying the launch of a new warship.
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War-era battleships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, they will have a powerful cannon, a suite of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods  the newest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to home ports.
But the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships  that are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas  will be old by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of major "software and hardware flaws" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors  only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the Navy's ability to add future superstructures.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project  including crew training  also becomes an issue.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion)  from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was actually running out of ships capable of carrying out missions.
The official said that the problem has become more acute over time as old ships have been decommissioned but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be inducted into the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted at a manor house in the Scottish Highlands aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats as well as the brown arrow-tailed waterbeds at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations on the property to track the bat's activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' call sounds, as well as which species are emitting them.
A habitat map and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of grasslands, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain as a whole have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
The risk to the population may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night-hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which oversees the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance, and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a great bathing ground", he said.
We have old buildings, very old trees and a complete suitable habitat.
But there's still a lot about bats that we don't know, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stresses that it is important to check for bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as the unintentional destruction of a shelter can kill up to 400 females and young bats, as well as wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of our animal species, because we just don't know what's happening to their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyers are suing a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people "want to become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video addressed to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the post as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
"What was said about me today is fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to be famous by using my name.
It's not a bad thing.
They want to build up popularity behind my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine", smiled the footballer.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they call "unacceptable publication of suspicious privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage" in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years.
The incident in question allegedly occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the accident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "99% good guy", but in this case he just gave in to the "1%".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared of revenge" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret losing its car manufacturers
Britain will forever regret losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnton, near Derby.
"We need a deal", he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a delay at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnton plant  where the Auris and Avensis  are produced last year produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's head of Burnton.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, say they're going to close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the 'on time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to replenish its inventory at the Darbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's "chessboard" plan for the future relationship with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal.We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but to be able to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Following the claims made not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to ensure successful supply chains.
Toyota cannot say how long the shutdown will last, but in the longer term, they warn that the additional costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has worked at Burnton for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly worried: "From my experience, if these jobs go, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have set out a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues his fight, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been fueling rumours about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he was resigning.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations in New York, a meeting with him was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would have preferred not to fire Rosenstein", but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There's no date set for that yet, it could be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it could be pushed back to next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10th.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not because of a dislike of "demonstrative behavior" by television journalists, although he did say: "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior".
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding, without citing evidence: "We've checked those statistics".
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you've seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and it will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times bizarre behavior before a gathering of reporters.
The Minister for Health addresses EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service on Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes for them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The UK-EU negotiations on leaving continued over the summer, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, no matter their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home without question and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury during Saturday's game when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just passed out there", Reid said.
Coaches and paramedics administered oxygen to Abercrombie at the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/severity of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore on a college scholarship, is in his first season at Tennessee State since transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Under new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on UK property purchases, with the extra money to help the homeless.
This move would neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK, with the extra proceeds going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will support the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The supplement  which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and property purchased for the purpose of surrender  may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects revenues to increase by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13 per cent of newly built buildings in London are bought by people with non-UK citizenship, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to enter the property market.
Many of the wealthy areas  especially in the capital  have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the big building firms of keeping property prices high by plundering land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix Britain's housing scandal.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would like to devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always have its doors open to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy homes as easily as hardworking UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said that his "greatest career ambition" is to be the head coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scot has taken on the challenge of reviving the north-east English club, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points off the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one game for the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland's Hampden games, which I watched as a kid with my father, so the national team has always been something I've been attracted to.
However, this opportunity would only open up if I was successful at club level.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers included names such as Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo DiCanio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he had no qualms about inheriting such established names at such a famous club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success right now will be measured by answering the question, "Can I get this club back to the Premier League?"
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions, he's definitely at the level of the Major League", he said.
It won't be easy to get back to the top level of football, but I'll only consider myself a success here if I can get the team back there.
Ross has only been manager for three years, after spending time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the Third Division and turned St Mirren from a relegated side into a Championship winner the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was really at a crossroads", he recalls the time he took Aloha.
I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and having some significant success.
But being a player is hard sometimes.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel like being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my own skin in my entire conscious life.

The ideal time for a beer is 5:30pm on a Saturday, a study reveals.
The summer heat has boosted the revenues of Britain's struggling pubs, but it has added to the strain on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "Due to the prolonged sunny weather and longer than expected for England's World Cup appearance, July follows a similar pattern to June when pubs saw growth of 2.8 percent but restaurants took an even bigger hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and liquor bars, they had the best performance in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The food bars were also hit by the sunny weather, but not as badly as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of leisure and entertainment analysts RSM, said: These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home services sector.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent year on year can be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant managers and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired break.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK pub, bar and restaurant sales analyst, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over GBP 9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents

Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" profile that they showed their parents.
One in five children  some one in 11  create a social networking account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows a rise in fake Instagram accounts  linking to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" profile to show their parents, but they also had secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenage child who encouraged others to rape her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two accounts, with half admitting to keeping their accounts secret.
HMC's CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eliade Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eileen Doyle was elected to join the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her rich international experience over the last decade.
'Elyde is highly respected in the athletics communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from attracting her', said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help to promote sport in Scotland".
The American who won the 200 and 400 meters finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am doing some aerobics!

A milk pump ad comparing mothers to cows has divided online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milking.
To mark the launch of the highly anticipated 'world's first wearable, silent breast pump', consumer technology company Elvie has launched a humorous music video ad to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay to a song with lyrics that include: "Yes, I'm breastfeeding, but you can't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not a whip, that's my breasts".
The song goes on, "Pump, pump, pump, I feed the babies with them, pump, pump, I milk my friends".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplays the dairy industry's "horrors".
It's a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth", wrote one.

Another comment: "It is understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added, "So inadequate advertising".
Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "extremely funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The sucking made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I'll take it as it is.
This product is genius, someone wrote.
Another comment: This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who get high (often at their jobs or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and folds discreetly into an infant bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while they suckle.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, comments: The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the sucking and all the challenges that come with it, while also showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Martha Yakubovsky using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been smuggled into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has jumped sharply, even though monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who fear risking staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective guardians and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80 percent of those who are either guardians or family members of guardians are in the country illegally, many of them criminal aliens.
So we're going to keep chasing these people", Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of 60 days as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many people appear in a video conference call rather than in person to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter officials and reports that have surfaced from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs of a child's problems are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the "tent city" without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can compound the trauma many are already dealing with.
Syria demands that the occupying forces of the US, France and Turkey withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "appropriate action will be taken against them".
'They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,' he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war on terror" is nearing its end in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle" until all Syrian lands were cleansed of both terrorist organizations and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria who are primarily training and advising both the Kurdish factions and the Syrians, the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Muallem said conditions were tolerable and they could return, accusing "some Western countries of fueling unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns", he said.
They're turning into a political issue what is a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib allows for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the current constitution's members" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump is gonna win a second term
By this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency is prematurely ended by impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At this point, there's no sign of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops the ratings for cable television, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers riding a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She said, "Why?"
Mrs. Scovel told me he said, "Because it makes me laugh".
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that's shown on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
The exception is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet the desire to be an informed citizen does not match up with watching a six-hour panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book Fear; Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (a vest full of arrogance according to the Washington Post); and Storm Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I specifically will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what it does to make you feel like you're part of a reality show is give you a little bit every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, in regards to the changing cast and daily twists (eating with the National Football League, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flies this week, his place on the North Shore of Kauai was sunny, 80 degrees, but he was locked in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
"I remember once when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,'" Mr. Flies told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Investments are pouring into the most hotly contested race in the early congressional elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is getting a cash flow from the rearrangement of congressional districts and hence two incumbents for the same seat.
The recently redistricted Pittsburgh suburb points to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is significantly contested by the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District sparked a financial dispute between the major party funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the much-discussed March by-election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with some pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heart-to-heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only foreseen against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million US dollars in American anti-drug, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be excruciating for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rate.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, serving as a continuation of a similar gathering last year seen as a step forward in efforts to stem the influx of migrants into the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior administration authorities made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now, Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will attend the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further strict announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who wished to remain anonymous and who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is currently a significant piece of evidence in the public record.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is also focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our election.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will be that Mr. Trump will have to answer to this body just as he prepares to face his constituents, and perhaps a jury of his peers.
There are many unknowns here, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, nor that of his kind in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight goes on.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, as long as the West stood up to him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the relentless march of democracy speeds up or slows down.
Right now, Americans are facing several similar junctures of the moment.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculates that he is not fit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein has announced that the Times story is inaccurate.
How will we react if the new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, as requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite sexual assault and perjury charges?
And most importantly, will we vote in the congressional primary if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because I have learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who had been taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to progress from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from playing his first game of the season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for Rangers this result can become a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game hoping we could win something and we walked away with a point.
We might even have won at the end of the game, but overall the draw seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, we were better in the second.
We're looking forward to Thursday, another big night of our European games.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it's going to be a tough match because they scored a good result in the last meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can do our best and get a good result.
Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are having a really good time, the training is productive.
I hope we can put all our efforts into forgetting the past season and achieving the success we want.
Women worry about their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed it with family members.
About half of the respondents in a Nationwide survey said that they discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven't taken the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with your counsellor and your family where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your choices when choosing a long-term care financial institution may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a cash value to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles early on.
Appoint a health care proxy so that you have a designated trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial representative.
You can choose a trustee to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Put those details in writing so you're prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors are", Martin asks.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, aid agencies are unable to receive information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow beach strip on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an approximate population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important for the province but is mainly concentrated in Morawai, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
A tsunami hit western Dongala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on December 26 off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra triggers a tsunami wave that hits 14 countries and kills 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remember the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Truck Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pre-Detainment Building and on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, certainly" when asked to plead, media reports.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital  Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It's alleged that Saipov, 30, used a truck rented from Home Depot to carry out the October bombing at a bike lane near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and cyclists on its way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to the intent notice in connection with the death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges could result in a death sentence.
Weeks after the bombing, an expanded federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder related to racketeering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of assault and vehicular manslaughter.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of execution as "horrific, brutal and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibulayevich Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Lori Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Earley, Ernan Feluci and Alejandro Damian Panuko", the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police say.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment says.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleads not guilty to the charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty verdict and life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all concerned", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of Britain's Independence Party said politicians should feel the pressure when a member of Theresa May's own party proposed he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain would have left by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling with deeply divided party ranks was highlighted by pro-Remain Conservatives who joined a separate Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise Chequers plan despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
Allies insist she will make progress in her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the protesters, "Leaving means leaving" in Solihull, that he wanted them to throw Chequers.
He stressed that Mr Farage should have been involved on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we must scrap the Chequers plan".
He stated his opposition to the EU: 'We did not fight in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bon rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The perception that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative MP Andrea Jenkins also attended the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually took to the streets and actually helped us get elected.
Please drop the "Chequers" and start listening.
In an open letter to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers hold their ground when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians must feel the pressure if they are to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit and we're gathered here today to say we're not going to let you get away with it.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags reading "Conservatives Against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the party's application security problems when he opened the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy the IT systems and all the technology of Canada and more, and more, for unhindered border crossing, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren said he would seriously consider running for president.
State Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic representative spoke about her future during a Western Massachusetts city council meeting on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican U.S. Representative Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's at the center of speculation that she could take over Trump's job in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the people in attendance asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was high time that women went to Washington and fixed our broken government, and that included women at the top.
There's an arrest in the death of LSU's Sims.
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting Friday night that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a news conference at 11:00 a.m. eastern time.
They released a video of the shooting Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head, ultimately resulting in his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, having a weapon, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6'6" kid who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's guidance helped him beat Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously strained Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two corners, giving Vettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel made the pit stop first and left Hamilton to deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which looked like it might be decisive for the outcome of the race.
Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out after Fettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a daring maneuver and a tyre-to-tyre drive, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly clear the inside of the track to avoid an overtime penalty after he had already blocked his opponent's path with a dangerous double defensive maneuver at turn three.
On the eve of his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He then even led for a rather long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually overtake Kimi Raikkonen in the battle for fourth position.
He finally pited on lap 44, but failed to catch up enough on the next eight laps and eventually Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me pass him.
"The team did an outstanding job to win the first two podium places", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally Saturday over her claim that she did not distribute the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were evil and disgusting and dishonest.
"What can happen and the good things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the press and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
You know what?
Diane Feinstein, did it spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't spread it.
Well, hold on a second.
"Did we spread the word?" "No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September but Feinstein denies that the distribution happened from her office.
"I didn't cover up Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she requested.
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that was very bad body language.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault against three women, the president pointed out that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
Look at the dishonor, the shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to regain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won the league title
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have recovered from Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants, winning a rematch at Dundee 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied the game at home before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen cemented their victory.
This is the third Elite League win for Adam Keefe's boys, who have come from the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning their last three games.
The shot that Dwyer opened the scoring came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaul, and then David Rutherford doubled the lead, assisting Bouvier four minutes later.
It was a tight start, with Sullivan getting the hosts back in the game at 1:10 before Matt Marquart helped tie it with a quarterback assist from Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to give the Giants a lead before the first half, scoring the second goal of the night late in the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again leveled the odds with a powerful punch in the gate at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time this match late in the second half as he gave his best and cemented the team's victory with a fifth goal in the mid-but-last half.
The Giants, who have lost their last four games in five, will host Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight controller died to make sure hundreds of people on board an airplane could escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continued to hit the area and many people are trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly shaken control tower at the Mutiara Siss Al-Jufri airport.
He stayed on to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia's Air Traffic Control spokesman Johannes Sirit said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We've arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong was restricted.
"We expect the death toll to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet (6 meters) high devastated Palo, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance is bringing more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There are robberies everywhere in the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? " reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports one person is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific now reports that one person has been reported missing after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they could not contact a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their efforts to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats owned by local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American Bill Jaynes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane went down too low.
"This is extremely nice", says Janes.
Janes says that he and the others managed to slide through the deep water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says sailors repairing a nearby dock also helped with the rescue operation, using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank in the water about 100 feet (30 m) deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that over the past two decades, 111 people have died on flights with airlines registered in PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any cases.
Analyst exposes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution wrapped up its presentation on the case Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testifies for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed his cell phone was in Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy is that Telis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Roulett pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative perceptions of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argue that hip-hop has moved away from its origins to political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate hip-hop consciously.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are being revived in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New York nanny sues a couple after being fired for a racist message.
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong message from their mother complaining that she's "the next black person".
The couple denies being racist, calling the request "extortion".
Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to learn that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
The first black woman to text her husband, Mrs. Placebo-Flaxman.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "confused" Placebo-Flaxman fired Morris, saying that her previous nanny, an African-American, had not done her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a day's pay and then sent home in a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the layoff, demanding the sum of $350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I'm sure this is discrimination".
In response to the complaint, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that terminating Morris' employment was the reasonable course of action, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, "Joel Plateau, the husband, told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it.
Describing the claim as "extortion", Plateau claims that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
You'd attack someone in that state?
That's not very nice", the investment banker added.
While the case is still pending, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, rebuking them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were concerned that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads a book for the first time before it's published.
Now that we know the huge success of Paddington, it's a lot of fun.
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a teddy bear, would have been optimistic about the book being rejected, adding that he was celebrating the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of our family", she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and he was not boastful", she said.
But since you felt Paddington so real, it's like having a child who's accomplished something: you're proud of it, even though it's not really your doing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that she didn't expect to survive", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to say she was gonna die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She left some time before that and that's how it ended.
I should have just sat there and waited, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have pulled myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, still grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one understood", she said.
I was bowing my head and tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her.
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent more suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put up postcards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she shared.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everybody knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up any room.
But he quit his job before he left, and he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis shared: "I'm constantly worried that this will have some consequences".
Mrs. Davis makes the cards so people know they have someone to go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep silent  you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphries, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her life partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He got to the bottom of Christmas when the kids were opening their presents, he didn't even look at them or anything.
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: "It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI begins an investigation.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants  an investigation of limited duration and scope  maybe we could join forces , Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee  was falling apart  despite the entrenched bipartisan blockade.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is because of the moment.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans don't perform well, it will seriously hurt their bids to be elected their representative on the state's highest court.
George W. Bush calls senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is declining under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong Sug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There's been no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the North Korean refugees eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalemate in nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm first unilaterally", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Congressional Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unstable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted this way, they would have called her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and moving when discussing his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "an egregious and coordinated attack on the individual" organized by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was clearly biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these allegations and the way he's persecuting the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he were appointed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll put it this way, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to walk into a courtroom and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'"
Women need to control themselves.
That's a valid criticism after months and years of venturing anger, and she can't take it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't find that unusual, do you?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a CEO somewhere, who said that she cries when she gets angry, but she developed her technique where when she gets angry and cries, she says to her interviewer, 'You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm pissed off.
And then it just goes on.
I thought that was genius.
Tears are allowed in an expression of anger, in part because they're misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories from my previous job, in an office with mostly men, is how one day, while I was crying out in unspeakable rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck -- a chilling supervisor I had always been a little afraid of -- and she dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided there was no reason why she couldn't consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me 30 years later, laughing.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was for another one to show up.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because she entered the campaign late, she fell behind with fundraising and decided she would not stay in the race unless she was able to raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed from the start.
She understands that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech announcing that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was overwhelmed with so many feelings -- gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so hard to raise money and be able to address voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism that she became emotional.
"One might think I had a nervous breakdown", recalls Mrs. Schroeder, "how the media reacted.
Some might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my headstone?
She cried?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning shot this year by imposing tariffs on key items of Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs hitting US$200 billion worth of products, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with counter-tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against any US attack and the world's second largest economy is not expected to ignore this anytime soon.
To make Washington give up is to give in to demands, but to bow publicly to Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the trade war with the US could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, a research associate for Asian affairs at the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria has declared its readiness to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism', he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to return them to their normal state.
Now all the conditions are in place for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or aid from countries that have funded the rebels will not be accepted.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
So the U.S. has six straight losses on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the required 14.5 points, which guaranteed victory over the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had performed poorly for most of the tournament, stopped his first shot on the 16th hole (with a 3⁄2-pound shot) in the water, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari performed exceptionally well in all rounds, becoming one of only four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 tie since the tournament has been held in its current format since 1979.
American Jordan Speight lost decisively by 5&4 to the player on the European team, who is at the bottom of the ranking  Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who is likely to make his last Ryder Cup appearance.
Sergio Garcia of Spain, an eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, has become the European player with the most points in the tournament of all time, increasing his total to 25.5 points this year.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can raise the glass again.
"The team is the most important thing and I am happy to have been able to help", said Garcia, who was thrilled after the European Championship win.
He hands the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play", said the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and his overall Ryder Cup score is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles - a record only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has struggled all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have shown top-class golf all day.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
We put a lot of pressure on the European team this morning.
There was a fight.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
We're gonna regroup, discuss the important issues with the USPGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and just look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take your hat off to your opponent.
We were just outnumbered.
New on the red tide: concentrations are falling in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions of growth breakdown in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide floodplains stretch approximately 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Algae blocks can be seen 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they're less than last week.
Red tide is also in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there have been reports of moderate concentrations in coastal areas or slightly inland in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in coastal Hillsborough County, high concentration conditions in Manatee County, high concentration conditions in coastal areas or inland in Sarasota County, moderate concentration conditions in Charlotte County, high concentration conditions in coastal areas or inland in Lee County, and low concentrations conditions in Collier County.
Respiratory tract infections are still being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory tract infections in northwest Florida in the past week.
