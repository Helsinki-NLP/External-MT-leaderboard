The Prague stock exchange fell to a negative at the end of trading
After a sharp fall this morning, the Prague stock market corrected losses.
The shares of ČEZ accounted for almost half of the daily trading volume.
The Prague stock market has been trailing since the start of Tuesday's trading to its Monday drop, falling almost six percent.
This time, the downside is the fall in Wall Street.
We also see a market reaction to the vote by the US House of Representatives that refused to support a plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
The fall in shares in Asia
Shares in Asian exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although the indices eventually erased some of their losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng Index fell almost four percent during trading, but later it erased some losses and reduced the drop to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, and Shanghai markets were closed.
Sydney stock market was down more than 5 percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market, according to the index, fell 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the rescue in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world", said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it determines its monetary policy independently, without being dependent on the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should return to the negotiations immediately and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, the threat is that other countries will feel the effects.
The bloody bathing suit of American stock
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to cost up to $700 billion.
Lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole.
U.S. stocks were in a bloody slump on Monday, and major stock indexes fell their biggest in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell almost seven percent, and a similar drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the bill had not passed the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress backed down: the US government could pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top officials of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed to a broader form of financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on him will be early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in the negotiations to approve a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
But it's not won yet.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the bill and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee.
Sources say the Senate could probably vote on the plan first Wednesday.
According to the economists, the announcement of the rescue plan's approval should be the first major psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, there is a 'switching' afterwards due to the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan has to be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the market stabilization package should look like", said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, in a statement to Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government fund.
It should buy back unsold mortgage assets from financial firms that plunge financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to go ahead with the recovery plan, but I think we're there", Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to get a final deal in Congress by Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first time in the time zone where a congressional decision could affect Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear when both houses of Congress will vote on the bill, or whether they can't hold a last-minute meeting on a problem.
Lawmakers are hoping to get it approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining funds if it feels the program is not doing its job, and that's another $100 billion and then another $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in negotiations
The President may veto this decision, but Congress may veto it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, whose value had fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the mutual efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies".
Limitation of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money program, taxpayer protection from losses, closing reliefs, timing of the plan's funding.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called gold parachutes for the directors of the participating companies and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
It should be run by the Treasury.
"We've worked very hard on this and made great strides toward an agreement that will work and be beneficial to the market and to all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new installments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly payment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
What are you doing?
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patriot Finance chief economist David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"That's because it's not known how or at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will divide their losses", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan gets approved now or early next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"It is far more important that this week's congressmen agree to support this plan and to consecrate it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to be approved is the most important at this time", Marek stressed.
A knife fight: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll give you advice on how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to buy a standalone player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the use and demands of the future owner.
You're probably not going to get a top-notch, expensive phonograph at home to play on the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come from LP plates and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
But if you have vinyl records in your shelves that include art rock, jazz, or blues, you'll probably at least dream of a phonograph like that.
It's the same with music on the road, that's music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
It can be unacceptable for someone to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would probably have a hard time chewing a $20 headset from the marketplace.
Two extremes, between which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines battery life
Some of the top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobile phones do by no means.
No modern device is as universal as a phone.
Besides the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better camera, a worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can barbecue and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of mobile phone has its disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy feeds.
Few cell phones can play music for more than 10 or 12 hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap phones, you can expect them to be out of the game for a few hours.
If you're going to call back and forth, get another charger to work for safety - even for more expensive appliances.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, and even worse ones can last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem is when you record music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, you can record music directly to a memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile without reducing them.
With the exception of iPods, you don't need any special software.
All you have to do is plug the device into the music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and playback devices already create their own music library sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or even the user's rating.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories, similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones are more capable
When choosing a particular device, you should be particularly concerned with battery life, memory capacity, sound quality and type of output and, of course, control comfort.
If you are primarily into music and you listen to it every day for a short time, such as on a tram, you can use any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which almost any mobile phone can do.
You don't have to watch too much about what music formats your phone or your player can play.
MP3s can handle all of them, and the vast majority of the music you get will be in this format.
It's one of the most widely used instruments, and in addition to that, most instruments can also play music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
All you have to do is visit the relevant website of the carrier (or other provider) and buy the song or album via the mobile internet.
This service could itself be a good argument for a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way music is sold (whether via GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet) that the music industry will dominate in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones around.
Whenever you get a taste for something, you plug your phone in your pocket while your MP3 player is lying in the forgotten house.
But it also depends on whether you always carry a headset or at least a hands-free wire.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones is the price.
The cheapest ones are usually under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you'll have a very decent walkman.
But most of the time, you'll be limited by the absence of a regular headset.
The best and technically the most advanced phones, even with a 3.5mm headphone jack, cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, their ease of operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by anyone.
The minimum functionality, the control similarity to a previously standard tape recorder or perhaps a phonograph is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile internet and a consequent massive data transfer account.
What device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the relevant card you'll get 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, go to Cowone, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Ivory.
According to the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you're a more demanding listener, you'd better go for specialized mobile walkie-talkies (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate MP3 controls, which bring the comfort of the operation closer to a separate MP3 player.
The company is now part of Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user interface as standalone MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price range up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I should.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
But there's something missing here -- a virtual operator that would make the classics cheaper.
He may not be gone for long.
We've written many times on Mobil.cz about the Czech operators being among the most expensive in Europe.
Moreover, this was confirmed by the OCTs, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming charges may lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
It may sound paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration rate of over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to gamble that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák has often called on them to do so, saying several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a traditional operator with its own network seems to have little chance (otherwise, it would be hard to find frequencies).
But there's another option - a virtual operator.
The very entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought about a significant price reduction to which the traditional operators also had to react.
And even before the launch of Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, voices in the UK sounded like ours.
But it turns out that there is a place for these operators to be, and they can be, really successful.
Besides, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you of the launch of the mobile operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
The Bank is a publicly traded company, and is a publicly traded company.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a more specific target group.
In order to operate efficiently, they require far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not involve relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually described as low-cost - offering inexpensive calls and SMS, but often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even a bet on an unharmed target group can be a pretty good bet.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust", says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual carrier.
It's hard to say if a concept like that in Poland could be caught up in our country.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav Čepický disputes this: 'The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings.'
In the Czech Republic, there's no chance, mobile operators say.
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region", said Jana Studničková, press spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, it tries to make sure that no potential competitor emerges.
GTS Novera has long been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of enterprise customers.
"We are keen to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them", says group press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's looking forward to better times.
From the unofficial information, it seems we should expect the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room for a full-fledged virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has contacted us with a complex and serious project in this area", Vlastimil Sršen of the press department of Telefonica O2 told Mobil.cz in his statement.
Other operators also rely on the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press spokeswoman Martina Kemr adds, in a rare line with O2's statement: "We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project to build on".
He adds: "By the end of the year, there will be no virtual operator on the T-Mobile network.
We should have a concrete agreement on the table by now to be able to consider this short-term".
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický comments: 'We are open to working with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
That's what we consider the most beneficial for our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared mobile high-speed internet network.'
Responsible authorities - One-handed with operators
The move by mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would increase competition, lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should we make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
The fact that operators can pull a rope when they want to is also evidenced by the drag around the U: background.
Probably the greatest pressure on the TPP was at the time of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
The publicly available information on the OCTs website is a witness to this.
But now it's U:fon that's a good argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
In this respect, Martina Kemr pointed out: 'The competitive environment of the mobile market has been further strengthened recently by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on it and, in particular, on its services.'
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the total disinterest of the Czech regulators is directly shocking.
This is not just the attitude of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere in competition.
These are exclusive to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPCW).
But he took his typical approach to the whole issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the potential bidder offer was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional operators,' stated Kristián Chalupa of the EEAS's External Relations Department in response to our question.
The comments made by the operators' representatives in this way are not surprising.
This is more than a consideration from the Authority, which is to represent the interests of consumers and, inter alia, ensure that no one abuses their market position.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the overseas countries where virtual operators are common, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services".
However, it is clear that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not in the interests of the EEAS.
In fact, the shocking thing about the whole case is the emotional agreement of the three mobile operators that comes from their reactions.
The question of whether it's really just a coincidence is all on its own.
Like the absolute price of gasoline at the gas stations, it is certainly just a coincidence and a fierce competitive struggle.
'The Authority has not found any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have an adequate increased responsibility for their market behaviour.
The telecoms regulator is also likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market for virtual operators,' Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of dominant position in the market is one of many points of contention.
The Commission has therefore considered that the Commission should be able to assess the compatibility of the measures in question.
In this market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts have a different view - the virtual operator always needs the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, quite logically, has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment, it has to be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning to the EESC that the three mobile operators are acting remarkably similarly.
However, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera mentioned above) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The imposition of liability on the OCTs is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications where the OCTs are throwing their hands off the whole matter.
We've met him on a few similar occasions.
Unfortunately, the recent Telecommunications Act did not allow the extension of the powers of the CTU to the field of telecommunications competition, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the WHSR must know better than they do, but their interests are obviously elsewhere.
It's what happens when no one's watching
The functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone pricing services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Their own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies are usually only for the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company is acting like a classic corporate customer to the operator who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special offers (and more).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If the cases you are talking about occur, they could be a breach of contract terms that we are dealing with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company", Martina Kemr answered our question on this issue.
However, it is highly unlikely that such activity would not be carried out by the responsible people of the mobile operators.
In particular, for the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers could be lost.
None of the operators will be able to prevent such a procedure.
These companies have substantial profits from their activities and, unlike the actual virtual operators, do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the potential problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered and therefore cannot be used in full as regular customers of mobile operators.'
But that's what it should be, at least weird.
In addition, another question arises for the OHIM.
If mobile operators are blind to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the Authority has a fairly strong authority to disclose such an activity and, if it does not wish to, it is not obliged to satisfy itself with the explanation from operators that they have no idea of such an activity and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As the text has stated several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a marked decline in the prices of services.
In virtually every country where virtual operators have emerged, traditional operators have tried to prevent them from emerging.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, or perhaps too saturated, market, quality of service problems, etc.
But in developed countries, it was at this point that regulators intervened, protecting not the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they have succeeded in creating the first virtual operator and bringing in new ones.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case away like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot help but feel that uncertainty in competence is more than good for them in these cases.
But let's not throw a flint at the living.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator appears at our site very soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it is difficult for the EEAS to remain reluctant to reject (discriminate) other interested parties.
And we might stop calling the shots than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day, presented a new recording of the national anthem Where is My Home.
The National Theatre Orchestra, led by J. Whitehead, has recorded the song.
There are four versions - male or female solo singing, in choral performance and instrumental accompaniment.
The song was recorded by Catherine the Priest and Adam Plachet.
The authors of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
The Whitehead considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he has deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices who are prominent and popular for singing solo variations.
"I tried to make sure that they both had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they agreed", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where My Home Is" was first performed in 1834 on the stages of the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovak Josef Kajetan's The Tyle, accompanied by music by Francis Škrup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
The first line of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after Czechoslovakia was created in 1918.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" hymn sound like?
Prague Highway Authority on Wednesday for the first time
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be entered in the history of the Prague Transport Agency as the date when the first passengers will board the subway, tram and buses with an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
He can get about 100,000 people who own an Opencard chip card right now.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day and 90-day and annual voucher (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and upload it to their chip card at the Infocenters and workshops of the Transportation Agency at the Museum, Bridge, Holešovica, Angel, Roztyly, Letnje, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the transport company www.dpp.cz.
By the afternoon, over 400 customers had used the service.
Those who start using the Internet can definitely forget about the exit windows at subway stations, where they had to stand regularly in long lines for paper tickets.
The voucher is purchased online and uploaded to an Opencard card at one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"Travellers have trained service providers at these locations to help them with online shopping and to upload the purchased coupon to their card", said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to download electronic Opencard coupons from self-service vending machines installed in several metro halls.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket signs, and passengers may have noticed them at the metro stations of Rostilla, Budjeivka, I.P. Pavlov, Florence and Vltavka.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty", added the Watchful.
The coupon checks the driver's seat automatically
The service of the machines that start tomorrow is simple.
You just need to get an Opencard chip card into them and a prepaid coupon will load on it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital city but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on suburban trains and bus lines numbered 300 to 499, the main route to the capital is the inhabitants of the central Czech municipalities.
"In trains belonging to Prague Integrated Transport, the guide is equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons", explained Filip Drápal of Ropid, the organisation that compiles the schedules of Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's safe.
The driver must therefore not only show the chip card on board, but also place the Opencard at the designated location next to the cash register.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the coupons uploaded, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not use city buses and do not remember when their coupon expires may return to the ATMs where the coupon is recorded.
Here, the validity of their documents is displayed on the device display.
The Sudetes wanted a referendum on the United States
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 demanded that the Schuymawa be incorporated into the United States.
It comes from a letter that's in the collections of the South Czech Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, a group of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the president of the United States for such a wish.
This is the result, among other things, of a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now in the collections of the South Czech Science Library.
The Germans from the Czech Krumlov request in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "Sumav parish" - taken by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be sure that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", says the letter, signed "The people whose fate lies with Schumacher".
Because joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national nature - only hope of brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president ask that he take over the protectorate over Shumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would cede this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and repels minorities and has done nothing, nothing, to contribute to the Allied victory", the letter says.
The authors' inability to sign is allegedly due to fears of the vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States is supposed to doubt the views of the Schumacher Germans, it would be enough for the Schumacher County to hold a referendum on whether its citizens want to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, some scholars say that it fits the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had at least the slightest idea that they would be expelled from the republic, few of them accepted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Republic.
He was a wartime budaeo-German stationed in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would use Czech", said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war had expected to be deported from the republic under the Beneš decrees.
You don't mean to - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks the driver
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
Still, it could be described as an emotional media campaign that the Department of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Rebecka promises to discourage the driver from dangerous driving behavior.
The $150 million campaign will be on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, and on the flyers.
She should discourage the driver from driving too fast and drinking behind the wheel.
And remind them to be vigilant before they leave.
It is aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the sweat?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is also the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't mean to - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in large letters on the spelling.
And in the bloodstain, there's the word "pay".
It's meant to symbolize the fact that a person can pay with his own life in a moment of inattention.
The spectators will "scare" the spot until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of drastic victims are common.
He promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whips for the driver
"The driver is a sugar and whip system.
The sugar for them is that if they go red, for example, they save time.
Whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk", says the hospital's transport psychologist Martin Korán.
And that's why we need press campaigns and, above all, negative advertising, says the psychologist.
He says that signs warning drivers of danger are becoming less effective.
"If a static warning sign is installed, it will probably soon blend in with the environment and drivers will not pay attention to it", warned the Koran.
Olmert would have returned almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The President of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan Valley, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview that was published Monday in the Jedi Achronot diary.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories, if not all, will have to be returned", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories to us, but we will have to give a similar percentage to the Palestinians (Israeli territory) because without it there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to the two July attacks in the city that killed several people and wounded dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic sites" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not going to work", he added.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they're going to have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support they provide to terrorism (the Shiite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and jihad (the holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law is not known. You can't ride a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could travel on the bus during trips.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's actions are contrary to the road traffic law", says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the least safe spot in the car at the time, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, a bus may crash or crash sharply, even while a steward is handing out coffee or newspapers.
The role is to determine whether the bus is equipped with a parking space according to the technical documentation.
If the bus is not approved, the passengers must sit.
The Student Agency long-distance buses have no stops; this was confirmed by the company's director Radim Jančura.
"We dealt with this with the Ministry and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
The decision was later reversed and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet for trips if they have their own seat", he said.
The law of stewardship is unknown
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prevents carriers from providing services.
The road transport law only knows the term of the vehicle driver; it does not define his rights and obligations,' adds Hanzelka, a spokesman less explicitly.
On the contrary, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, considers that the law deals with the issue sufficiently.
'It depends on whether the bus has a permitted parking space in the type-approval.
That's it", he says.
The buses are divided into urban buses with parking spaces and limited maximum speed, intercity buses with parking spaces with higher permitted speeds and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest permitted speeds and seats equipped with seat belts.
It's like flying a plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Horín does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers in a smooth ride, and the situation is like a service in an airplane.
"Neither is it certain when turbulence will come and the pilot will be hit in the head".
"But if the bus were to stop sharply, of course, the laws of physics would apply.
Just like a city bus or a streetcar.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by the carrier's internal regulations", he says, adding that the issue remains unresolved from a legal point of view.
The Yanchura is willing to cancel the service
The Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus operator.
He's got 200 of them.
The director does not consider their profession a risk even after the accident.
"But as soon as I realize that the stewardship is a risky profession, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers on board.
It would save costs", he says.
As a safety concern, the absence of stewards in their cars was justified by the Asian CEO Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it's going to end in some kind of fatal injury", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was a tremendous tragedy
In a train accident in Naples, a young Plzeňska stewardess who worked for the company for two years died.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off the sidewalk without using a directional lane and blocked the bus.
His driver tried to avoid the manoeuvre, but he lost his right front.
That two seats would be sold for the rest of the stewards, Janchur refuses.
"These locations are not available for long-distance connections, they're blocked".
The company's gonna sue the truck driver.
With the compensation for the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the court to hear it, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Amend the law?
In the blink of an eye
The specifications for the movement of the stewards on board the bus could lead to the amendment of the law, which is being worked on for over a year by a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"But she has not reached any concrete conclusions.
Buses don't solve too much, but rather the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving", says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be something that would seriously threaten the safety of passengers", concludes spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board to the employees of the bank is not without its big words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf-based financial institution's units with Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank will create a 'central financial group institution for capital markets trading', according to a letter released to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will enter into this transaction a 'set of competencies' providing long-term returns.
And, indeed, such a link could be a decisive impetus for further mergers in the land banking sector.
Such texts are produced when the management wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission but also by the Federal Office for Financial Supervision, whose message to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The link between Deka-Bank, which is known to customers for its savings and investment funds, and WestLB, of whatever nature, has been discussed for some time, even on the Frankfurt side.
At the time of the presentation of the results of the six-month management period at the end of August, Franz Waas, Head of Deka-Bank, was told that there was no point in merging his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with one of the country's banks, such as Helaba Bank or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is represented by half of the national bank and half of the savings association, has entrusted the management board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be capital market transactions or part of them.
But the negotiations have only just begun, the financiers say.
Deca-Bank, which has 3000 employees and is one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial market, is not mentioned for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that there might be a merger between Deka-Bank and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
There was nothing in the end about this trio.
Shortly after the plans for the merger were made public, the Hessian government objected to Helaba's participation.
The other two bank houses didn't even connect like that.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead acquired by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there has been repeated speculation about the merger of Deka-Bank with national banks.
However, in recent times, Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba's Board of Directors, has expressed his disapproval of speculation about the linking of his financial house to others.
However, it seems to be independent of this belief that the convergence of the different public sector banking houses is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the Bavarian parliament, the first thing that could be done is to start drawing up a link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not exactly good news for Helab.
If the pressure to merge further increases, potential partners for such a merger are gradually lost.
In the south, she would play only the second violin, even though she has so far faced the financial crisis far better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Union of Savings and Loan Banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85% stake in Helaba, again banned its links with WestLB.
The most likely consideration would be Nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how closely linked the business models of the individual institutions are.
In June Merl stated that the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanken, the German Savings and Loan Banking Association, had not yet answered.
All this could also lead to the dissolution of WestLB, which no one in this institution would have wanted, of course.
That's why the local board's letter also says it's trying to find a "complete solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to link the individual components to Deka-Bank will be shown in time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "The weekend with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luc, it's the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena's gonna be his girlfriend, so he says it's gonna be different.
Behind them, a stronger beard stands by a five-liter Kaiser, and demonstrates to 200 Oktoberfest tourists how deep tones can be thrown out of his throat.
Elena gives Luca a slap and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the Port Nuova station, four buses will leave at 11:45 p.m. tonight, with the sign "Destination Monaco, festa della birra", scheduled for arrival at 6:30.
Three buses are mostly Italian, one bus is exclusively Brazilian.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their flag, celebrating at night.
And that's not something for Italy, says Marco Guarda.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a fur-like undercoat and glasses with wide silver rings, owns the three buses.
He's been riding with them for five years at Oktoberfest, and this year he's only been on three trips.
Night there, day between the beer stands, 10:30 left.
Staying overnight would be a waste of money, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, down the highway to Brennero.
No beer is served, not yet.
The bus is shutting down fast, the passengers are sleeping.
They're doing well, they're still going to need their strength.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where it makes one more stop on Highway 8 just outside Munich and a host of other Italian-branded buses.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7:30 a.m., as planned, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are waiting.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has his last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
One, put on a yellow hat.
It is written in Swabache on the left, "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
"As soon as the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and fill the back of the tent.
"Not forward so you don't interfere, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, spread out across the space!"
The price is 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the snacks.
"Show the security guards that we're being decent.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Be here at exactly 11:30 tonight!" You understand?
And up on Wiesn, the beer tent space.
On the way, one member of the group hung yellow hats as markings on trees, signs, and even on the campaign poster of a major Bavarian party.
We must prepare for retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "The weekend with Italy".
The exact number of visitors is not available; there are 50,000 who travel across the Alps and enter beer tents, with 10 percent of all visitors reportedly arriving from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force will be reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, while Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics, in which Italians are in first place ahead of the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular among Italians.
A night off for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
As recently as last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and that he also included in his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis.
Because the one last weekend came up.
The Dax-tracked financial house specializing in real estate finance Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive several billion loans from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turmoil.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid would be up to 35 billion euros.
The interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from the amount actually exhausted.
They say the money comes from private and public banks.
In the background, the losses of the Depp subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, this state financier refinanced long-term projects for which he lent money in the extremely short term, which is no longer possible now due to distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves declined by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its share of equity decreased slightly from 1,6% to 1,45%.
The current and net financial trading returns fell to zero from last year, the returns on increased debt and certain securities and the cancellation of the credit trading reserves fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only because of the higher returns on the reimbursement of the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and on the reimbursement of interest under the tax regime and on the business of the group companies, the 16 per cent decrease in revenue was still moderate.
The former state financier burned down mortgages for the utilities after its privatisation in 1990, which were then taken out of the service portfolio and continued to be run by Aareal Bank.
Since the traditional public financing was too low, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing private-public-partnership (PPP) projects and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write off the value of its subsidiary and these write-offs will have a "fundamental material effect" on the profit and loss calculation of the entire group, as some have been uncertainly told.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It has already been cut by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Depfa.
More than other institutions, it relies on cross-border refinancing because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the interbank lending pool practically ran dry because the banks are keeping their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for a portion of Depf's credit portfolio - around EUR 50 billion - annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected 'from the influence of international money markets to a significant extent by currently incapable functions'.
Other sources have indicated that this money ensures refinancing until the end of 2009.
In contrast, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use money markets in the near future.
The Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that Hypo Real Estate's competitiveness on the market is now ensured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But given the dynamics and impenetrability of the crisis, there's probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely possible that the loan should not have to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late Sunday afternoon, the rescue cannot, even if it is provisional, calm the passion.
The stock price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond prices were good.
While the preferred debt has practically not moved, the secondary bond rates are falling more significantly.
This is mainly the case for the bonds of the former Württemberg subsidiary Hypo and logically the bonds due after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally appeared as an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood in terms of the stability of the international financial system, following the sharp deterioration of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that took over the company by taking over Depf.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are willing to support the system, the maturity of the securities can be expected.
But what almost no one dares hope for now can also happen - the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports that came at the same time as this partial nationalisation, the probability of certainties has now become only legitimate hope.
This will likely prepare long-term creditors for a series of waking nights when they will decide whether to forgo their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the threshold line at least to convert losses from previous financial years to exchange rate returns in later years for the purpose of future capital gains tax payments.
Sylvan and the Secret of the Bento Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop introduces herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start to say: "Germany is a Kawai!"
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana has known this word since the beginning of her new blog about exchange residency.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already chased on the way to school.
I live in the outskirts of Tokyo, heading for Kawasaki, and I'm a 40-minute train ride to the high school in Tachiban.
I had to find my way, thankfully I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the teaching in Tachiban is not as strict as it is in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin meeting after 8:00 a.m. and a short home-room session with the teacher begins 20 minutes before 9:00 a.m.
But before class started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have a school uniform yet, I wore my hostess' old skirt, plus a blouse, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
So I stood up in front of the bench, so upset, and tried to say everything right: "Sayónara Wo še Sylvana"... - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was so glad that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, whistling and waving and I could still hear the word "kawaii".
I knew that from my mangs.
It's one of the basic Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "sweet, sweet".
Then I quickly stepped into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I was literally drowned.
They were talking to each other and whispering and asking me what was possible and what was impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
After the break, everyone packed their bags.
My hostess made me a box of these for lunch, too, and it's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little pairs, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu toast.
I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
It's all really good, of course.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, bro!
Benta in Japanese schools are not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which is especially artistic in this case, and hopes to get to know the boy better at lunchtime.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can see it here too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause I'm just fascinated by it.'
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning a little Japanese one day.
So I was perfectly clear that I would have to come here one day.
Because I have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen".
Even rats have feelings
When rats or cockroaches run from danger, does that mean they're afraid too?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings, too.
But how could we know if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
For years, the online magazine Edge has been publishing contributions from well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a selection of answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe animals have feelings and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has ever been able to prove, when we can't prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But once we start to focus on another kind of thing and open up to questions of perception or general consciousness, we're entering a disagreeable field because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: it pretends to be dead, runs away, or attacks.
People behave similarly, which some scientists judge to be comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
This is partly because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that humans are different even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature may be the linguistic nature of man: Because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if the consciousness of language were not important, it would certainly be influenced by language, so the animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
So it's hard to tell what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or analyzed, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, its exploration puts us in the middle of big problems.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and that's exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, which was developed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural correlates of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: they may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the nonfrontal cortex for visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I'm inferring that an emotional system, like a fear system, is activated in the brain consciously by its own activities.
So what we call "fear" is a mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain's defense system (or its effects, like bodily reactions) uses operational memory.
Viewed from this angle, the senses are closely related to the areas of the cortex that primates, and especially humans, are characterized by.
In connection with the nature of language, there is a subtle graduation of perception, because we can use words and grammar to distinguish and categorize states, to attribute them to others, alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem that are dedicated to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could easily have played a part in the feelings felt by several animal species.
I cannot, in theory, dispute this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what we think of as fear in rats and humans is likely to be the same for both organisms: But how can we verify, Pankseep goes on to say, that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flee danger - does he feel fear?
In my view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the similarity of experience.
True, the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but cockroaches have no brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans, how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'd rather study emotional behavior than rat emotional perception.
In any case, we can expect to see progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don't study the language and the consciousness of a rat, I don't study the feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
It may seem shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than throw myself against the wall over and over again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: A moment of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a testament to Ukraine's confidence and its ability to organize the ME together with Poland", Vasjunyk said.
"But for our country, it's not an amnesty.
The work has just begun, and there is much to do in both countries".
In the early implementation of the timetable for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are liable.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work as quickly as possible now", said the president of the Ukrainian Union, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time".
An even more radical step has been approved in Poland.
The Polish PZPN Federation was dissolved by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that PZPN will not be able to comply with the rules", Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini by letter that this step will not prevent preparations for the 2012 UEFA Champions League".
A few teams from the Premier League were forced to relegate just last season because of manipulation, and eventually the start of the league had to be moved too quickly.
The angry Dennis Quaid is back in the game.
She wanted to advertise a new movie, she talked about private things in interviews -- and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex-Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's angry and he's hitting back.
A late war rages on for the ex-spouses Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having a nasty fight together - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with InStyle magazine last week, first expressed the reasons for her marriage's collapse: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it has been very painful".
She said she didn't know the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The inspiration for this mental comic strip was Ryan's PR work for her new film, "The Women", which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was stark: "He's crazy", said the 54-year-old actor to the New York Daily News, "Meg is repeatedly chewing on and tweaking the history of our relationship".
In addition, it is "remarkable" that Jack, a 16-year-old son, is once again "recommended publicly by the pain and radical changes that divorce brings to every child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become a father of twins.
He concludes his reflection on the stumbling block: "My life is moving on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing great".
Airline and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one recent study, flights were even 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel accommodation have again fallen - according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, following the increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already fallen.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
The reason for this trend is considered by American Express to be the weak dollar exchange rate that has caused "the declining desire of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centres more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even set a European record, rising by 26.3 percent.
Airline ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
The increase in fuel prices meant that Economy-class passengers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, when long-haul flights were even 29.2 percent more expensive.
Between April and June, the Economy class fell by an average of 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, but the Business and First-Class classes showed less significant changes in knowledge.
Prices in Germany fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter, they fell 23.6 percent.
In the German domestic years, prices fell by even half, according to the study cited.
One of the reasons for this price drop is the slowdown in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many air transport market segments is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific measure to prevent the use of the airport by airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With one gate and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, the Luhukay still fails to build a working eleven.
It was written by Kristoffer Klein - to increase the Unsuccessful Landing for Rep. Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player got involved late and failed with a ball stuck on the stick.
His message was well-formulated and convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal", Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway to the booths of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the half-hour break was over, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist at HSV for nearly three decades and is more respected than many actors of the moment.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol pulled up and raised his thumb at the sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Joll.
His order sounded probably similar: here with the second goal!
It didn't work.
"It didn't look good today", admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wish it was more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the head of the Mladena Petriće (11) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbachans could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory", Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV is celebrating 121 years of existence this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated board on the video wall that featured their team as the winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a big party.
"We know how to evaluate it", said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the consistent scoreboard represents the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilian Nevese and Silva, goalkeeper Petriće and FC Bayern gained from Janssen - is slowly, but it can not yet shine.
"We need more sense and more dribbling", Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the rescue package sinking caused the Dow Jones to drop 700 points.
It was the biggest one-day point loss in his history.
Later, Dow got a little more.
At about 8:30 p.m., this world's most important stock market barometer showed a 5 percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than 7 percent at 1,548 points.
The worst was at Dow at this point, American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be reinforced.
Goldman Sachs' stock has lost almost 10 percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett, a major investor, owned a stake in the company.
The rescue plan will provide funds to purchase the so-called damaged mortgage.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at once but in stages.
In return, the State should receive the shares of financial companies which could be redeemed in favourable terms, thus reducing the burden on the State budget.
Shares are falling sharply in Europe
The billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the US are not a thing of the past.
The shares of the German giant Hypo Real Estate are sharply falling and are pulling back the Dax index.
The Dow Jones is losing despite a planned financial market bailout by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have brought the German stock index (Dax) down to a low.
The shares of the Munich real estate investor lost up to three quarters of their value, Commerzbank losing more than 20%, despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000 point mark and scored 5,839 points on a 3.7% drop.
Stock markets were on their knees all over the world.
In New York, the Wall Street business day started with a significant loss.
Investors are concerned that the US government's $700 billion bailout package may not be enough to revive the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, in the first hour of trading, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate could vote on October 1.
The other European exchanges were moving in one direction: the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent in London, the CAC-40 index in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei index dropped 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial earnings.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and the trade ended at a value of 12 595.75.
In MDAX, they lost their share of Arcandor after the announcement of the capital increase.
Private Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group also announced that it would not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter is affecting spacecraft flight.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space.
The fault of the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, now threatens her death in winter.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon - the gravitational pull anomaly.
Gravitational pull is an aerial maneuver by space probes to gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space object, such as Earth.
That can save a lot of fuel on the probes.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been amazed at for years in this case: Flying bodies do not behave as one hundred percent would expect under the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are accelerating or slowing down unexpectedly.
Physicists have not been able to explain this effect until now.
He was baptized by gravitational anomalies.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter by curving space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and he tries to explain the gravitational pull anomaly by using the so-called dark matter discovered by astronomers in the universe.
"The cause of this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth", he writes.
Space scientists have only known about dark matter for about a decade.
It obviously produces gravitational force, whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
Scientists estimate that this dark matter is a good fifth of the mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Italian foreign minister in Egypt said the abducted tourists are back on the loose.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in the pre-release shooting.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
I hear the ransom is already in negotiations.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is bringing you the most important cases.
European tourists trapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and Italian media have reported the same.
According to Italian television station Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health", Frattini said.
According to Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, and their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the desert expedition are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the hostage-release shootings remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were prepared to finish the abduction before the Sudanese army killed six of them in a surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom", said the employee quoted.
He said it was "just about taking hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese troops shot six kidnappers and captured two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, and the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom, citing one of the German mediators, said the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by a Father "led to Suicide"
Several years of abuse by her father led to her committing suicide, the court said.
After pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment, Michael Trise, age 50, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death", Trisa wrote in his confession.
The court also said that Ms Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007 aged 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who spent a significant part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the ghost of abuse that occurred to her twice a week.
Plaintiff Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, friends of Ms. Randle, who was also a surfer and cyclist, said that she was "emotionally dead" and that she had "abandoned her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It's believed she choked herself with an ice pack.
Randle faced her stepdad, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse it.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't, the case probably wouldn't have gone to court at all".
"I would like to highlight in particular the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years", he added.
"Otherwise, she would most likely be a promising, successful, happy young woman".
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train at Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offence against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said that such a move would come as a surprise to many at Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the government office", he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the officer on the basis of the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
Documents he forgot contained secret al-Qaeda analysis and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was transferred from his home to an unknown location.
Corporate reserves are facing B&B debt
British co-operative banks may have to settle a debt of more than £80 million after the Bradford & Bingley bailout.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 co-operative deposits.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Cooperative Savings Association (BSA), said it was "concerning" that the savings banks and their members must pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be paid off by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that will be settled in the meantime will be paid annually to all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Compensation Fund for Money Services for the BBC confirmed that all 59 co-operative deposits are included in this figure.
It's humiliating that these institutions that were so considerate... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were so far from considerate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits they held, and that the reserves should pay about 18 percent of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the debt will increase to £450 million in 2009.
That means the reserves will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the Cooperative Stock Association, told the BBC he was convinced it wasn't fair.
'It is humiliating that institutions that were prudent during the boom in housing markets now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far from so prudent.'
According to the BSA, no backup has been dropped since 1945.
"We're going to have to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks to see what the options are to protect cooperative repositories and their members from a bill that could be substantial", Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, there will be interest to be paid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since the cooperative reserves are joint-stock organisations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk is at five pence a liter
The people of Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence price hike in February, and comes after a survey by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want the price increase to be reflected in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bail for the ex-Bangladesh Prime Minister denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajidaya for bail, meaning that if she returns home, she can be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail on charges that she had obtained over 50 million takks ($729,700) from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges filed against her.
Khalid Zia, the longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-held government first give her full freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear, according to the terms of her release, whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she's now appealing the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Shaikh Hasina's bail application saying he does not need bail while he is already undergoing an investigation for a statement of honour abroad", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We appeal against the order of the Supreme Court".
Her lawyers said she needed bail to get her back from abroad in preparation for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Shaikh Hasina is to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalid Zia both deny all the charges against each other.
Fear of measles vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated against smallpox in the recent global warming campaign due to Taliban-linked violence.
The UN has been administering vaccines in six provinces last week.
However, she says she couldn't reach the children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or disrupt thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB lost the ITV case
BSkyB lost a court case concerning the review of a Commission competition decision ordering the company to reduce its stake in competing broadcaster ITV.
The Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB's stake was competitive and gave the companies disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in the deal which prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office for Fair Trading announced that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence and invited the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin Consortium, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organisation and Ofcom's regulator were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - in particular because BSkyB had previously stated that it was willing to renounce its voting rights.
New investigation into the American lawyer affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
This came at a time when the report on the affair prepared by the Justice Department's Chief Inspector General was critical of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in order to pervert justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "Serious allegations, including potential criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or explained".
Naming a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the Ministry said the lawyers were dismissed for poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the lawyers' release was not rated worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-profile Republican lawmakers and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
American lawyers investigate and prosecute government-sponsored legal cases.
They may be released at any time but shall not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Secretary Alberto Gonzales, was fired for his dismissal and eventually resigned.
Many other Justice Department officials have resigned as well.
The inspector general's report was highly critical of Gonzalez's role in the affair, saying he was "mainly responsible" for the firing, that he "abdicted" from his leadership position and that he "was not significantly involved in the affair".
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's great work will be rewarded
Rock star Meat Loaf is getting one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be attending a ceremony in London next weekend for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the recognition he received.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominees are led by Coldplay, who have been narrowed down in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them".
A song written by Jim Steinman needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental piece that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held the top spot for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - had been suffering from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he underwent surgery for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel his concerts.
It turned out later that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other land roads, some famous, others just useful.
But many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding the Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alleyway is in the East Village neighborhood and it leads north from First Street -- without getting to Second Street -- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At about ten feet wide and forty feet long, it resembles a rough passage rather than a traffic jam.
There's no street names on the sign.
In the ordinary atlas, it's virtually invisible.
Still, the alley has fans.
Take Avalon Bay, the developer of the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to re-flatten and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are set to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the short alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block before it was enlarged.
But the city's building protection and development department, which has the street in its hands, has no interest in keeping it.
At a township land committee meeting, city officials and Avalon Bay plotted a plan to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, Regional Manager of Community 3, the Committee prefers the option of keeping the streets in the hands of the city and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city now owns very little land, and we'd like Extra Place to remain in his possession", she said.
"Repair and management proposals could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access".
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it plans to redevelop a small street and set up seating areas, several of which would be used by a café whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokeswoman, said that while the company wants to take advantage of the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this empty alley and make it a beautiful place for the public", she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Conservation, said the city was actually selling the street, and he stressed that his office's job is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door to Extra Place led to CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps best known as the backdrop for the Ramones' album cover "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a wonderful place", says Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes".
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the East Village's upliftment, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that that piece of public property, while modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on Jeremiah's Mapping New York (subtitled "The Book of Grievances: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the City in Extinction"), posted a section of the Extra Place story from the Let's Talk about the City column that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The article's author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dark alleyway, also during the day, bounded by cut iron warehouse doors and sealed windows, where week-old newspapers are circulated in the drawers".
Except for a few exceptions, the alleyway one night looked exactly the same.
A rat ran across the street at the blind end near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the wall and an empty bottle of beer next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
A couple of passersby said he rarely thinks of Extra Place, but suggested he might need a raise.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thought some people underestimated the street's impact in its current state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were in places that were dark, wet and disgusting".
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this edition of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates' stance on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of "Better Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively reaching out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's education agenda is just proof.
The Obama campaign claims that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to attend college than white students", which is true.
To combat these performance disparities, the Obama education agenda specifically promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance disparities.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in the East Los Angeles area.
The students at this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently joined, are just learning English.
Yet in 2008 the state math test had an incredible 100 percent of fourth graders.
Almost as amazingly, 93 percent of fourth-graders passed state tests in English language and literature.
This incredible achievement was achieved by a different method than Obama's preferred one.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, continuous assessment of ability and unjustified access.
And, as Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school's pedagogical approach to those who are just learning English is "full immersion".
The immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had a tremendous success with one totally new student from Mexico -- you'd walk into a classroom in 12 months and never know who he is".
"It works", she said, "it works for us".
Would Obama take the school as Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large percentages of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The results the school is achieving should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the education agenda of its own party (the National Education Association has long been a supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education obscure the prediction of Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about "English-only" laws.
Instead, he said, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices plunged sharply on Monday amid concerns that even the U.S. financial market rescue plan would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of futures trades fell by 7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on the morning of the day to $99.80 a barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
Over the past two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, again raising a wave of financial uncertainty.
Anxiety reignited investors on Monday, even after the Congressional leadership announced it had reached agreement over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
This report was overshadowed by the recent concern that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive breakdown, the government announced that the Citigroup Group would acquire the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially liquidated the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the weekend's furious negotiations that led to the economic rescue plan "are proving incapable of reviving market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and currency markets has been very uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that the commodities will not be able to escape the infection.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the U.S. virus will spread around the world, and especially to China".
Analysts of this bank have reduced their expectations for next year as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth and have reduced their gasoline price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter broke the team record.
After spending the last eight seasons in the Jets' uniform more than anyone else, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the second quarter developments, where the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sleeper ride.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals faced their playoff loss to the clouds above them.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Colese on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly marking an afternoon in which their gradually developing partnership moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles out this quarter with two more touchdowns, including the one where he fell to the cornerback, and another 10 seconds left in the half.
"It was nothing special", Favre said of all his toys to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We were able to communicate well, no matter what people thought".
While Favre and Coles were fighting, the defense was attacking Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith was tampering with another setup and capturing it.
Linebacker David Bowens made Warner fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter, third quarter?"
When told that both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
There's been a lot of points in a short period of time".
The restless Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best distance runner ever when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first man to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
With a win on the pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he overtook his previous time of 2:04:26, which he had run last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, 35, set the 26th world record in his career, which is truly incredibly broad - he's surpassed the world record or at least he's the world champion in every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month Gebreselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon because he feared - perhaps too scared in hindsight - that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish line - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on the longer course, the marathon record for the past decade has dropped by more than two minutes since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with a time of 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a hip spasm two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously made him more of a hit than a delay.
"I'm so happy", Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little bit skeptical today, but everything was fine".
He was also criticized - particularly in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world marathon peaks, relying on drivers as if it were a track race, and setting world records above the point of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyan, Gebreselassie reached halfway through the race in 1:02:04.
After the drivers failed, Gebreselassie was constantly pursued by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
Just three miles from Gebreselassie's finish, he last took off and ran for Kwambai, who then landed second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenková, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, finished the year with a record time of 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff of Great Britain.
The 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin, and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal best by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully, letting four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run a big lead and then reaching for about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askalefa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of black life in a segregated city
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of Greater Orlando, miles away from all the glitter, noise and gigantic, lies a quiet city that is alive with the pride and the hardships of African-American life.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city to be incorporated and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of squash, two schools, and no prison".
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival of Dawn! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a sideline, even though she made it a stopover for tourists by including it in a Florida tour guide created by the Federal Writers Project during the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing".
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of race, many locals remain cautious of foreign views.
"We pay close attention to how our story is told", says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It must be right".
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It's both a historical model of black upsurge and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shadowy example of the Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way to call Hurstons here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of proverbs such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida Tour Guide transformed the city into a little bit of Highway 17, which leads through the often-overlooked center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With a big drumming in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road", she wrote, "is a white, brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playing fields, always cared for by Howard Miller, though he is not very literate".
She also mentioned Dash's widow's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that fits a watch hotel".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, marriage rejuvenation, and sex.
This obviously wasn't the typical Fodor's publishing house.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"The dawn said it like it was", says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, whom Hurston made immortal by quoting men who sang silly songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it", she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a cypress fairy who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that most of the time she came to town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that is still proud of decent dress.
Most of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were disgusted.
"The people of Zora always loved to see", Franklin said.
But, he added, she is rocking on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never staying too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were being withdrawn from print.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten her, along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance to the world or its message at all", said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to extend the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the local two-lane highway.
The Orlando spill has already pushed Interstate Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a complex historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the fight to mix racial hatred reached the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were sitting on the side", Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady here that was killed.
They threw the melon out of the car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and declared its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "offensive to my race rather than celebratory".
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, while positive in some areas, has diminished cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth.
"Black children were used to hugging - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening", said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier", said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to make room for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors, and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with slight confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand that".
In 1975, Alice Walker set off to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston's acclaimed biography by Robert E. Hemenway was brought to the bookstore shelves and re-recorded in the American canon.
The highway project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was rediscovering the ramp lights.
Her former Hurston neighbors now regarded her as a savior.
To show what could happen to their highway, the community began planning Hurston's Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
The state has withdrawn from the highway proposal after years.
"These five highway currents have resuscitated, you would say directly, real civic pride", said Nathiri.
Boyd said it simply, "Eatonville was saved by dawn".
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's image.
Outsiders like Rachel Munson, a lawyer who started attending the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the re-paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a summer rainy alley, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today, 90 percent are black.)
With strangers coming to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it's still often treated with caution.
Permission is required for most interviews, and certain things -- like murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by white people and showing blacks in the fields -- are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, confident teacher who likes to eat red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as the Hurston Festival grew, so did the pride of the home.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled, and so on, but not better, not worse, and just as proud, creative, hardworking, stupid, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, voices a sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police, which he says would benefit from some help.
And even younger ones, like the 11-year-old twins of Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, just walking through this door, think, 'Hmm, this town is nothing against the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently after church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city".
We all speak fluent financial terms here in New York.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from the newspaper booths and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't have realized they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in a glass-filled beehive of offices above their heads every day, the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolise New York City have their worst "bad day at the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The cops keep rocking metal carriages down the hallways and carrying muffin bakers to the breakfast meeting.
Hispanics keep moving between the towers, carrying like human mullas, fifty iron shirts hanging from the pendants on their backs.
Office rats are still in line for their morning bagels at the street food stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to cover the late afternoon shift at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not in front of the cash registers to collect or store cash, but in front of the checkbook, where older customers order cheque books, tourists ask for a way to Macy's mixed-use store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
But they've already taken their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrift stores (slightly similar to building savings), money associations and types of savings stores that operate in only one state and claim to care for their customers like a family.
In the past 15 years, such banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, was trying to catch a buyer.
The office and retail workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the savings on Wall Street.
The average New Yorker has learned a lot about finance in the last week.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket was on the phone talking to Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and her thin top executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity as if she were making fun of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, my uniformed 50-year-old housekeeper, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated after the Austrian right-wing crackdown
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing Free Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang are taking part in a demonstration presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organisation "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs showing mosques with red lines.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the graveyard in the town of Traun near Linz were severely damaged between Friday evening and this morning, and police are convinced it was an organized action.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists who hate Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if this incident was connected to the election in any way.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan draws to a close.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering a search for its own soul after the right-wing movement in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
Both far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free and Union for the Future of Austria, campaigned vigorously against immigration and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the shaqah and burqa, even voicing his opposition to foods that are perceived to have a connection to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood" that is to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides seek to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was primarily caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel across the border
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he planned to travel through France to Spain.
Kent Police approved the travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence to officials about Glitter's past child sexual abuse convictions.
Glitter, his real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Criminal Court hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the judicial service said: "On Thursday 25 September, the Kent Police asked the Ashford Criminal Court for a decree to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally attend".
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities that he intends to travel abroad, as is recorded in his sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also give the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police have announced that they will not be investigating individual cases of Glitter's possible travels through the county.
A Kent Police spokeswoman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems here that handle potential hazards more efficiently.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for Kent Police and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual assailants to minimize any public risk".
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the sexual abuse of two girls, ages 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities refused to let him pass his passport and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's lower criminal court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully applied for a warrant requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed for four months in the United Kingdom for possession of child pornography.
A Home Office source said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off stage".
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, distracted from the focus on interpretation - only so do I achieve a relaxed expression of man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
The other person.
Inconceivable, let alone private, in those moments away from the audience - that's when you can see a confidential gesture, a deeply captured gaze, or a passionate gesture of hands that are careless because they're not going to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less known faces of masters.
With this in mind, the photographer is putting together a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month program, "reflects the ever-increasing international significance of flamenco", says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of person, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personalities of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portray flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a record camera.
These are portraits that, through the selection of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different styles is contrary to the classical foundation of the image and gives it a contemporary spirit, an idea that Bauer himself says reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which never ceases to surprise and develop".
What draws the audience is not the act of the dance, the song or the play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most important thing, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is the constant work presented during these days in the gallery of El Fotomato.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists includes famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon be published in book form, which will contain exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea of the SportART project.
Although their concept differs from that of the Flamenco-people, the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them, and having the opportunity for a moment, whether long or short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don't even know, or they give you just a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
A collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galeria El Fotómata in rue de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he's writing is "poison"
Set in an environment he doesn't yet know, and telling of events unknown to him, Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project - he is currently working on a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and travelled to the Amazon.
The lifetime Nobel Prize winner admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is currently working on is "a boldness" and that "everything suggests I shouldn't be writing" this novel.
"If I were wise, I wouldn't do it, but I will, and I believe I will one day finish it", he concluded his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which saw in the city of Aqueduct over four days hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third annual Word Festival and he lived up to expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's prize for best writer - Dickens' old edition of "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the theater of Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Felix Rome, who introduced it, he had a dedicated audience whose hour passed like water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a noteworthy dose of humor, recalled how his original "incredible adventure" of "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and "the power to live longer than I have lived" gave rise to a literary message; how he suppressed "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully arranging the text, correcting and rewriting; or how his writing was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "memory images" are the basis of his story.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that "there is no way" to know whether and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is merely a fun, fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa stressed, saying that it "works on people" and "is a way to get out of the line", and urged writers to "not be frivolous" and "take responsibility" for their message.
The climate is losing the party in Pozoblanc - they lack spears
The spear-shaped performance that closes the ceremony in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after a statement from the performers was confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez, decided to cancel the bullfighting.
Adverse weather conditions have plagued the festival for a long time, with two out of three no longer being able to hold.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second scheduled bullfight.
During their formation, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to stand bulls in the arena in Castilblanc.
But it was only celebrated on Friday.
Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears, won the prize for a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing performance.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear shots for greetings and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than torero art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bullring of Los Llanos unarmed.
In the second round, he worked tirelessly and received a sharp criticism from the audience.
They got checked in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hashish.
In ten minutes, five.
The following information is provided by the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council.
Officers stop two people in the van and they run away.
The load, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to the Basque Government's Internal Affairs Committee, officers have pursued and detained one of the people in the van, a 38-year-old man identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forging state documents.
The incident occurred when several Transport Unit officials were conducting road checks on the N-1 at the points where it crosses the border of the urban area of Armiñón.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply and fled.
Authorities immediately began to chase the car when it stopped a few miles away at the edge, at which point both passengers jumped and fled into the forested ridge.
Ertzaint officials eventually caught one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish that the suspects were transporting, as revealed in a search of an Iveco Daily brand delivery.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages which were then transported to other police departments for detailed drug testing and weighing.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark was "stamped" and did not agree with the information in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Detained A.A.J., 28, was taken to the police station to complete the necessary formalities before he was later taken to the next level of investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence
Actress Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested in Santa Barbara, California this weekend for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness explained that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "stepped on the gas, drove back and forth in a loud noise, and tried to get out of the parking lot - she skipped over sunglasses several times while bending".
A witness who apparently did not know the actress at first saw Locklear a moment after she stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because she was "worried about Locklear's life".
When police patrol arrived, they found the actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the highway.
"She looked disoriented", and so the authorities took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center for testing.
A police spokesman said the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was later ruled out, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was obvious to the guards at first glance".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unidentified substance and taken into custody at approximately 7:00 p.m. although she was released hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU Association to exercise its powers in Silva
IU's chief executive and United Left MP, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of former Seville City Council's Youth and Sports Committee, Francisca Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of acting in favor of his family, will depend on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers", suggested Llamazares, referring to the meeting that the party will have to take in relation to the former member of the Seville city council.
However, the IU Chief insisted that 'transparency' was absolutely necessary in the investigation of the illegal acts committed by Silva: 'The IU has always fought to ensure that such matters are as transparent as possible.'
He also stressed that the party had a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Flower Blood" ("Sangre de Mayo"), the epic bet by Garci
José Luis Garcia's film "Sangre de mayo", inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's National Past Episodes, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "describe the expressiveness of the characters and the analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during a presentation of the film to a large team of performers.
Flower Blood, with a runtime of over two and a half hours, will be released in cinemas this Friday and a four-hour television series for Telemadrid is set to air in the future.
As a great admirer of Galdóse's literary work, José Luis Garci claims that he fulfilled his "childhood dream" by making this film, which he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to shoot the film for the bicentennial of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer, saying that the story will be based on the Episodes of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, which was fully contributed by the province of Madrid, is a "unique opportunity" for Garcia to create an environment with a backdrop and costumes that match the image of "a thriving Spain that was mistaken for a leader to fight for - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country under Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that was given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or The Ghost of Goy - almost twice the amount of Flower Blood - so he was unable to film some scenes from the script co-written by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has worked almost all his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver a empezar) works as usual - on stage with actors he usually rehearses with before filming and who he does not choose from casting because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the job of a director is, among other things, to go to the theater and the cinema and to learn what is happening in the craft he is engaged in".
Many of the actors he chose for Flower's Blood have appeared on several occasions before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, Flower Blood itself, Seven Tables of French Billiards and the last chosen Blind Sunflower, represent a young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is just coming".
Garc doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
"You think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're only working for a living, and you're willing to make one more movie", explains Garcia, who has directed for more than 30 years.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
The Sevillian flamenco dancer will pay tribute to another Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, the mother of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her family when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering the emancipation of women like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought to abolish the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolutions of interwar Europe, fascinated Isabella Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Peppa Gamboa, and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible".
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about capturing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "butterfly dance" evoked a guajiru or "snake dance" kind of tang.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance matched that aesthetic too", she says.
The show features two exceptional personalities: Miguel Vedó, who will sing Isabella in one performance as in "La puerta abierta", and the dance teacher Matilde Coralova, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former student.
"Matilde is the older Tortoise, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to be a part of my project, and I am honored to be a part of it".
The show also features the music and guitars of Jesús Torrese and Paca Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájar, the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist who are primads with everything, and who are always in love with everything".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who was living in her time in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at one time, but no one knows her today and even less appreciates her work", says Bayón.
The show starts at 8:30 p.m. today at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "Newlyweds Day" also closes the trilogy
The first illustrated edition of "The Newly Married Diary" is to be presented at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobio in March 1916, as part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Tale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
The Zenobia and Juan Ramon Triennale is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, a renovation of the Nobel Museum House, and a traveling exhibition, "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen Ray of the Sun", which opened in May this year, and after visiting various Andalusian provinces, it is scheduled to move to New York City at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of "Diary of a Freshly Married Man" edited by Pedr Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most revered Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman is not so much like itself anymore.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Evil Intentions", and under the weight of knowing that Newman had left, reveals her heartbreaking vision of abandoned American cinema and America as a whole.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be seriously ill.
He was a man to everyone, though.
"Sometimes what a man feels cannot be expressed in any way, and now I have lost a great friend", Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country have been better because of him".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of film and the father of the country died in a particularly dark time of terrorism and financial markets, at a time when American confidence is at its lowest, when people are desperately looking for reasons to be proud.
When times are tough and people are virtuous and only a handful of people you admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won cases, from the Anti-Doping Foundation, founded in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-cooked food and organic foods.
A complete treasure for a country that has taken a lot of effort to get rid of its suicidal food culture.
A storm of admiration has flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the highlight of his career.
A bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dares to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox has put a pretty high strap on all of us", notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few today who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman did - based on honesty and leading a serious private life away from the cameras.
It's not always easy, sometimes even possible, in today's media jungle.
But fortunately, that's the way people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful to him, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities to be absent.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May he be proud in heaven that there is a harmony on earth between his daughters and admirers - not so common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of being a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist".
The Imperfect Games of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us are longing for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's course, I say no!
It was touted as the perfect race, and in my judgment it was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that if I was a test subject and the evaluation was coming up, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's go back to the beginning, one by one.
The nonsense starts with picking up a race number that you have to get out early.
I don't think that's a bad thing, but when you're going there, they're gonna give you everything (including a chip to prevent traffic congestion).
But no, I'm not.
Here, you had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, just go there for that) and (after the proper line) - what a surprise! - they only had an S-size shirt (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
Where do we live?
So, the crisis is why they only buy little shirts because they're less expensive and less expensive?
Well, that's a small thing compared to what happened on race day.
Besides, it had to be very early for the chip and the front of it took over 15 minutes, he had to hand over his bag.
It took over 35 minutes to wait, which is uncommon at a race that's expected to draw 11,000 people.
So, as you might expect, the race started and we hadn't packed our bags, and when we did, it was much worse with the pickup.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have a short-term respiratory infection tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not be able to see the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me, which I assume didn't mark my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't think of this one.
And so I think we're just gonna have to pretend to be a well-planned Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on new technologies, Microsoft unveiled further developments in a new system of image recognition and human interaction in the form of artificial intelligence -- not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic functions like calling a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a messenger that would travel around the company's premises) and perceiving what they hear in a conversation.
With a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receiver" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He can also sort the present by conversation group.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist will record a third person and understand that they are not part of the group that is talking to them and that they are not employees of the company.
He asks her if she's seeing anyone, and he tells her he'll be there for her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
That's really cool.
But of course, it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, like a new version of Windows.
There's been a lot of talk this week about Microsoft changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and less associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured that if computers had only the most basic necessities, without the burden of commercial necessities, they would be five times more powerful -- man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
It's a bit of a revelation considering that Microsoft is adding new features and extra features to Windows every version.
A change of direction would be a merit-based act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I became one of those who leaned on the theory that it was Google's first step toward competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It's the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the muscle.
That's right, I'm not.
It never disappears, but the death of the operating system should be thought of not as absolute truth, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more attention to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer -- or Chrome -- and every day we spend more time on the Internet than we do around windows.
What's half the apps that connect the system to?
There's less.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this photo at a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search engines: "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, we confirmed a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It's not coming at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's start with 2010.
Microsoft is definitely going to try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they'll have to pay a high price for the delay.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Mother, and is part of the muscular gay community's uniforms.
And if we want to get into his life's roles, we can dive right into the image of a typical muscular man with a pointed mustache who lifts his beards in a strolling circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton men's underwear, fitted and sleeveless.
English speakers call it a tank, but le Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out above all others.
First, it is named after its neck-shaped name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as legend has it, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' stands out above the other high-quality cotton, unisex trim, distinctive label and (almost unnoticed) Belgian flagship, which models of the most emblematic suits have as a neck detail.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't just specialize in tank tops.
She also makes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy shirts, kids' suits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, and I don't care who's going to be a father".
Her immense resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small in character, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion roles very seriously.
For Monica, it means more than just some pretty, famous girl lending her name.
In Paris, she took part in a promotional event organised by Mango at its new headquarters and the announcement of the minor fashion prizes sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's hearty and bold and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango this fall/winter season, and I'm also here to present the second annual Mango Fashion Awards and a dinner at the Opera House in honor of Valentine's Day.
So it was a challenging day, but also an exciting one.
What's your new collection for Mango, which you've been working for for the past four seasons, coming from?
My sister and I love movies from the 1950s and 1960s, and we've been inspired by them a lot.
I also love to go around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combining and folding their clothes, which I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, it's all connected and it's got a lot of connections.
I was a little girl who liked clothes, and I always wanted to go to my grandmother's, to go to my aunt's closet and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch my clothes.
You know, we dancers rely on how well we're tuned to feel good in our classroom and in our rehearsal when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 years old recently, had a seizure?
I'm not.
I feel better than ever, I'm having fun at 30.
I find a woman is already done, experienced, and enjoying life with fewer flaws.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've been doing what I want since childhood, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body is asking for it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I'm gonna make my child feel happy and raise him with great love.
As for the movie, you're now waiting for a few premieres of the movies you made last year.
It is, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in theaters.
I come from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course it can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
I'll take it if you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the show floor next to Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization Women for a Better Life, and the clothes we showed - I also picked two models from our collection for Mango - went up in price and the proceeds were given to this NGO to Naomi.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of talk about her, and I know her, so I can tell you that a lot of it's not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good he's doing.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asked me to do a stand, I'd do it too.
I'll do whatever it takes for the women of the Third World.
Drivers repeatedly found to be in high blood alcohol will need to install an alcohol-free
The Department of Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must have a system installed in his vehicle to prevent him from starting the vehicle while intoxicated or if he is not breathing.
The proposal was made public in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the High Prosecutor's Office, which states that it is a pilot project that will last one year.
It aims to restore the driver to the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a road rehab course.
In addition to the National Road Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation for the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers accused of driving under the influence more than once will get behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if an alcohol concentration above the permitted level is recorded.
His price is over 1,000 euros and the culprit would have to pay it himself.
A similar US study in 2007 showed that overruns were reduced by 65% for vehicles equipped with this device during the first year of its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to ensure that this behaviour is addressed before it results in a criminal offence.
And to help bring it into being, since legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary reform of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been tested in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) recommending that the system be installed in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without peeptoes
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force aircraft with the Prince and Princess of Asturias on board landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun had just set, but its rays still forced the eyes to close their hands to see the successive couple emerge from the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood under the steps.
A few hours ago, I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
Yeah, that's great, it's not gonna get to the airport to pick up people at that time...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right.
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport, right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 Marines ready to fire the oath of honor.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very modestly dressed and with her hair sparkling, has no usual "peeptoes", apparently being told that a storm is imminent in DF.
Before they go into the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and unforcibly delay them.
At the door of the hotel where they're staying, one of the four largest in the city, they're being met by a talk show reporter from Mexico.
Best subsidized fashion price
There's probably no place in the world more suitable for fashion awards than Paris and probably no more outstanding designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second annual El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow for an international presentation of new fashion talent.
The price is subsidised to the tune of EUR 300 000.
Belgian first-year winner Sandrina Fasoli was watching her designs yesterday at the Manga Exhibition on the 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out.
It's the second largest store of this company in Europe, and it just opened in 1,335 square feet.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentin for taking over as chairman of the competition jury, led to our finally lavish dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
The solemnly decorated chair of Mango's firm looked even more amazing next to Chagall's most distinguished works.
With a heartbreak over the recent death of her brother, Nata, who had kept quiet, put on the brand's clothes and ELAH jewelry, which kept her breath hidden, and hung up in her son Louis - a nearly two-foot-tall elegant - accompanied Valentino to the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, accepted the welcome and as a true gentleman, he remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, since they both were offered to two ladies.
Monica Cruzeva, who arrived at the store in her own-designed pants and shirts and dressed in long black sexy dresses for dinner, was impressed by a night walk through the Opera with Goya Toled, showed us the ballet rehearsal room, and in remembrance of other times, grabbed one of the sticks and signaled "grand plies".
Inés Sastre did not hold back from visiting the buildings next to the palace, but before leaving she showed us pictures of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning, we were able to fall in love with Olivier Martinez, another young motorcyclist, and John Travolta, who came to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own clothes and towels and asked in advance that no scent be used in his rooms.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's the life.
The following information shall be provided:
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and angry everyday.
And to be more precise, they're all summed up in one book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 o'clock as punishment, but even worse, imagine yourself swallowed up in the rush of the rush that brings life to this day.
The office is called the tension and the computer is the back pain.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two ways to deal with daily exhaustion and the problems of detachment from the world of work.
No, that number is not much bigger or less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classic massages and spa therapy, Susannah Marriott has compiled a whole menu of options, tailored to each individual's taste and time.
The book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone feels that peace cannot be achieved in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
It also offers other ways to stay in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that help relax.
If your veins are no longer running adrenaline, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off, and focus on reading.
Sleeping Talks
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they're sleeping.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but it's actually irrelevant.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somnolence.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you have heard that he spoke from sleep at night.
This can occur very sporadically (for example, once a lifetime with high fevers), or more regularly (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There's not one reason why she's here.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night rage, nocturnal enuresis, or menstruation, but this may not always be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress, or agitated situations.
In any case, this is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child may speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (crying, crying, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where the child is manifesting himself with great force, it is appropriate to observe and consult a specialist to see if he has a problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests itself.
We said it's a harmless disorder, so it's not treated unless it's associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it's associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
But we can do that by keeping in mind a few very simple prevention measures, like:
Try not to disturb the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV shows or series.
For children who are very nervous and who are able to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
It will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
If sleepwalking occurs, try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child and the next day he won't remember anything.
Useful Tips
Don't be such a guy.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even though he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember, if you find that he is very upset several times in a row, it would be wise to seek counsel or to find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you can understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and to extract information from him.
It's not gonna do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to get his mind together.
And you can hear what he says, but you don't know what he's thinking, and you don't know why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you draw.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
It's very anxious.
Don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long sluggish period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the Yellow Jackets created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game was not too fast during this clash, in which the attackers only pushed hard.
After the first attempt of Captain Kauffmann's guest, who fired from a distance just a few strokes past the junction, Illhaeusern began to have a slight upper hand and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually came to stir up Dannemarie's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field and left only the agile Riahi at the top of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, firstly thanks to Dannemarie's two chances, Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well placed to process the ball thrown after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Gólman Illhaeusernu did not enjoy the joy for long, and after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his fellow players in a state of weakness.
However, Dannemarie was unable to recover from the situation and the Illhaeusern XI, who had only a little to retreat to "turn off" the defense, had no further problems, except in the very last seconds of the match when the ball passed very close to the edge after a great confusion.
Sarkozy is meeting angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a trip across Britain.
In order to face the demonstration of the strength of the fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted access to several Breton and Norman ports, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The newest appointments promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and they hope that "they will come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the 'Crisis Committee' set up by the Breton fishermen to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which has peaked above €1.14 per litre on average.
According to David Martinon, a spokesman for the Elysee Palace, the president "will discuss solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and pay for sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be a fisherman with no qualms.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted a "slow-moving vehicle operation" in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of congestion.
The recreational port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filtration dam has been operated on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The seamen showed their determination on Monday, when they set fire to tires and pallets in the port of Bresto and Lorient at dawn, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports along the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked commercial shipping.
Fishermen from Turballa and Croisici in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer people have decided to wait until they decide to act themselves, until Wednesday's ministerial meeting.
The 'Crisis Committee' is due to decide on Tuesday in Guilvinet how to proceed and its participation in the preparatory meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Department, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave from nothing" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, president of the fisheries department in Lorient.
Fishermen who do not pay a tax on oil currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the yield threshold is only reached when the oil is below 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The memorable Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at age 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes bowed to the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the threat of a recession looming over the global economy.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 delivered aircraft, its President Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is very promising from the Chinese market, especially given its range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG is reportedly considering a 15% move from its assets
American International Group, which was flooded by the U.S. Treasury, is considering divesting more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it was given as a down payment, reports the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to investigate the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international arena and pension activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
The AIG's management board met on Sunday evening to examine the possible promotion, according to the FT.
AIG could not obtain any confirmatory statement.
The assets AIG intends to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to pay off the $85 billion loan it was granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of being seized by the US authorities at 80% of its capital, while allocating the current shareholders to an appropriate proportion.
Paris, analysis of the historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest ever point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, with its predominantly technological component, lost, according to definitive data after closing, 199,61 points and stabilised at 1 983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
In a row since the start of the session, Wall Street has literally fallen apart after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected a plan to rescue banks, a plan that would allow markets to regain some stability.
228 votes against and 205 abstentions refused to grant the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to a market that sees Congress unable to adopt a particular plan", believes Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'It shows how much the market relied on this plan,' she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come 'too late'.
"If this project is indeed doomed . . . , the staff will be immediately transferred to the Fed and other central banks to ignite the crisis, further strengthening credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist of Global Insight.
And stressing the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that in the United States "every new day brings the downfall of a financial institution".
After Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual organized the authorities to buy back the banking activities of Wachovia Bank from its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and demanded immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are dealing "not only with the US crisis but with the global crisis", added an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has been booming.
The 10-year cash flow decreased to 3,632% from 3,827% on Friday night, the 30-year yield to 4,161% from 4,357% the day before.
Obama won by points in the first televised duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, a second debate followed, which was to determine which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama pair won.
The Republican and Democratic campaign leaders were not surprised when they both announced their victories in a televised duel that was watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop a poll drop five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup poll, which released a public opinion poll on Saturday, credits Obama with a five-point lead (49 percent versus 44 percent for McCain), judges the Democrat to be the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter most, Obama is the winner for 39 percent of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25 percent attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the supposed good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden during his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented", Bill Clinton said of the weekend.
Seventy McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while emphasizing the "naivety" of his opponent on the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... was the repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have the experience and knowledge to become president", he added.
In this aggressive spirit, they've been on since yesterday's Republican TV spot.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and he turned out to be concise and precise.
He has highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the United States' reputation in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does", replied a weekend Democratic commercial blaming the Republican for not taking the impact of the crisis on "the average American" into account enough.
"In the ninety minutes of this debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama declared yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at a North Carolina election rally in heavy rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "working class", and the financial collapse clearly favors Obama, who the Americans see as the best way to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a turning point", estimated influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democrat Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current disaster is "the final verdict of an eight-year economic policy of bad conduct, as conducted by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain".
A senator from Illinois reiterated that despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to cut taxes by 95 percent of Americans, and also noted that achieving the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion financial assistance plan passed by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
"Did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and regime opponents demonstrated on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening, immediately after the closure of polling stations on the main square in Minsk, to protest against the irregularity in parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "dictator, resign".
Some admit that they did not even vote, saying, "What if they still do what they want with my vote?"
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian gays and freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are deemed fair by observers.
The opposition said it wasn't.
"We were kept away from election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, a diverse grouping of 12 parties.
"This is a cosmetic change", stresses Aleksandr Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "because who counts the votes is important, and we have executive power.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it's by being nominated, not elected.
Their entry into Parliament, however, can mean television space, regional meetings and bills".
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political process because 'a dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
Because if our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we don't reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the election, will not declare the election valid.
It stresses that turnout appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"Did you notice that there were elections?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was not a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who are most in favour of the regime".
The silence of the night has once again engulfed October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission wish you success.
The Blood That Is Sure Again
HEMA-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased that HEMA-Québec had become one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he has regained public trust, which was severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980's and 1990's.
As is common knowledge, the national blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Board was contaminated with the HIV and hepatitis C viruses during the 1980's.
In view of this drama and the wave of public displeasure, the Canadian Government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Judge Krever waited to submit his report, some provinces launched a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this task was carried out by the Géline Committee.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to host Québec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the Supply of All Provinces and Both Territories.
"When Héma-Québec began its activities in 1998, only 38 percent of the population still trusted the Quebec blood system", recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
Through continued efforts to increase blood safety and steady work in this area over the next few years, we have regained public trust", he says, adding that by the beginning of 2008, Hémé-Québec was trusted by almost 94% of Quebec's population.
However, Dr. Decary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"We saw many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, then in Europe", relates the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if the disease could spread through blood.
We therefore based one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, that in the event that we do not know and that there is a risk of spreading serious disease, in this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, exclusionary measures should be taken.
So in April 1999, we refused blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Then, a few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease is blood-borne.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to be cautious".
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus itself to be directly detected in the donor blood rather than the antibodies on which previous tests were based.
NAT tests have shortened the gap between the time the patient is infected and the time when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this time to less than a week.
We've significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and without us being able to find out.
This improvement has significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
One in 12 million people today is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that before someone gets HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products a year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission via blood products to appear.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions for healing in complete peace", says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what kind of disease or fetal element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus was discovered on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the bloodstream by insect bites.
There is a need to be constantly vigilant,' continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also expect sufficient supply.
"The demand is growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population is also affecting the blood donor network, which on average only comprises 3% of Quebecers eligible for donation".
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, according to the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who donate blood are not accepted because they carry AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where they are treated for muddy cold, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortcomings are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to their age and inability to donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to donate blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so messy these days that we rarely find an hour to donate blood", says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are deposited at Hema-Québec, which also operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, is a blood vessel rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of spinal cord blood samples into the bank, and we expect to collect over 1,000 a year.
Early next year, we should start offering them for transplantation", explains Dr. Decary, who describes the cord blood collection program as a popular one.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to it", because Hema-Québec doesn't have enough funds to offer this complex and expensive program to all Quebec hospitals.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montreal qualified for the USL First Division semi-final stage of the knockout series yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive quarter-final match played on a total number of goals, thanks to a 3-3 win (4:3 goal difference after both matches) over the Seattle Sounders.
The goalkeeper Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-way defenseless first half, back David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could consult Matt Jordan on behalf of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two quarterfinal games, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will match their strength in the semifinals against the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder tied a 3-1 home game to win 4-1, but the Whitecaps advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 overall record.
Impact is scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will not be confirmed until today.
In short, Kovalev's winning goal.
The first offensive trio of the Canadiens is ready to start the season.
A unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomasz Plekance and Andrey Kosticin last night at the Bell Centre encouraged the attack to win the Canadiens 3-2 on individual raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two assists and Kovalev scored one goal in this fourth win of the three-game series of six prelims.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring the only goal during individual raids.
"I'm not ready yet", the Russian warned.
"I need one more game to feel good".
"He tried to handle too much in the first third", noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause".
Charest betting on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out an early election by the end of the year.
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-elections.
"To move the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented in a visually engaging way yesterday at the end of the Liberal Party of Quebec's meeting in Levis, without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a kind of screen mill.
On three huge canvases, there was a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the perspective of Google Maps, maps, etc.
Generous funds, just like in the run-up to the election.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out an early election in the autumn, although he warned that he had a very busy schedule.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth dimension of the 'vision' the Prime Minister intends for Québec, the 'new economic space' vision, which includes the labour agreement with France, the Canada-Europe Convention and the agreement with Ontario.
Although the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - has been mentioned by the Prime Minister in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "jewel of immense potential", but did not give a date, amount of investment, or clear priority for future projects.
The Commission also considered that the Commission should be able to take into account the fact that the Commission had not yet adopted the draft budget.
According to Charest's calculation, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice the size of France is ours", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just with us, it's within us", he stressed, as if to show that he's invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, the prime minister pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future", he added after taking a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional attitude that has been echoed by all governments.
There is one frontier that has long been without a convention, and if the opportunity arises, I will re-engage in this position on behalf of the government,' he said.
Otherwise, "we also need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change", he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that the occupation of territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequistan MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with some 30 communities.
The action was launched by the Committee of Ministers, chaired by Benoît Pelletier and having an important role for Julie Boulet (Doctrine and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be laid out".
The development of the North should, moreover, be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North's plan will be "together designed, structured and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamless follow on the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the most hotly debated topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail marking the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to the party leadership.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to move Beauharnois' headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godboute, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out the Quiet Revolution and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourasso, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future", declared Jean Charest.
At a press conference, he called on another authority, this time conservative, to address the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When the turn came for the Eastmain 1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan on being there", he confided to his membership base, which caused a standing ovation.
The same Prime Minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of holding elections in the autumn of this year, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially the Federal Council mission in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend rally provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "statutory reform efforts", which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Quebec Liberal Party) specifically demanded recognition of "Quebec's specificity" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have the right of veto in respect of decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition was skeptical of the North Plan in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois has reiterated the Northern Quebec Development Policy, launched by Landry's government in 2001.
She said that when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it gave up this policy.
If she had stuck, "we would have been on today", Marois noted next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is today) François Mercure.
ADQ has said it will support the adoption of Plan North in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theater", explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Countries disgraced
It was Vic Toews, the former Justice Minister (oh ironically) in Harper's cabinet, who last summer ventured to say about Louise Arbour that she was a "disgrace" to Canada.
To so humiliate a woman who has led a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the Prime Minister's environment and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government that, as the only Western country involved, has not returned to its homeland a citizen imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
The government, which doesn't even consider that at the time the crimes alleged against him were being committed, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature to the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier to rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one that relies on a parody of justice to judge the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and in particular the Canadian Bar Association are advocating for Omar Khadr's repatriation to await a fair trial in Canada.
The same government is turning a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is next to be psychologically devastated, and this has undoubtedly lasted, after all these years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we're witnessing the slippery erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our "democracy", words Harper has been so bent on and his mouth sounds so empty.
There has come a time when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him at the pleasure of the head of the minority government until now (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has given up what has made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Towes, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell's speech by Barrick Gold
In the 17 September issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
It confirms, with Orwell's logic, that the world's largest gold producer has launched a lawsuit against three authors and a poor small publishing house for insulting honor to provoke a "transparent public debate" and demands six million dollars.
If it's true that judges are independent and impartial, they don't judge the truth, especially in the case of a lawsuit of honor, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver is completely oblivious to this fundamental distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate to bring to justice anyone who dares to defend a position that is contrary?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will be forced to spend decent sums to prepare to defend and fight a highly unbalanced battle against the army of lawyers backed by the almost unstoppable pockets of the mining industry.
The tactics of these unbalanced battles, moreover, often consist in the liquidation of defendants in order to impose conciliation proceedings which will silence the parties and, moreover, frighten anyone who dares to take up the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it had to present its view of the whole thing to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, debate is usually about exchanging ideas, not about punching a bullet.
So it was not enough for the subcontractors to open their books, their documentation and to start a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole thing.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and has been clamoring for rejection of petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" while contemptuously denying the public's views?
In the vice president's world, it seems that the word only refers to the fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it's a rather narrow concept of the term.
In a democracy, even the nationalists have a say.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining industry.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and assess the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution that is meant to be a "public debate" prosecution (Barrick has, by the way, just issued an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce that they should stop using the term...).
Not to mention Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold-initiated prosecution is a direct attack on the university's freedom to seek and seek truth, which is essential to any democratic society.
It generally rejects the right to quote reliable sources and to debate the facts and interpretations which constitute the basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are not liked by the wealthy companies of this world without repeated prosecution, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have created it if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has a right to an answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debate and disagreement and resolve conflict.
Barrick Gold's overcharged lawsuit makes it clear that despite what he claims, he has no desire to conduct a transparent debate.
It's a loss to the university world, as it is to the public debate in Canada, and it's time for governments to put in place measures to limit this kind of unlawful prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to stem the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for better control by elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money deposited, new measures to capture the number of houses seized for non-payment and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, minutes after midnight, after the two-day marathon of negotiations had ended.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to ensure that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis that is happening on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and disruption of American daily life will be enormous", Republican Judd Gregg declared.
In the last few hours, the negotiations have been at full throttle for fear of the effect of another failure on investors' sentiment.
The deadline was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for U.S. president were invited to negotiate later and both expressed their preference for the deal, but failed to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has agreed to supplement the agreement with some measures, notably one designed to allow homeowners to stay home, and measures to pay state-run employers to rescue firms.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is no point in congratulating.
But these measures are necessary,' he explained on TV.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was asked by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so".
"The rough traits I read [indicate] that this is something we all have to digest and move forward with.
Choosing to do nothing is simply unacceptable", he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy back doubtful claims and risky and unsold assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayer money.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by a bubble in the real estate market that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then moved to other, more widespread forms of loans (PCAA) and resulted in a freeze of cash and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The Republican lawmakers are concerned about the failure of last week's first draft agreement.
Ever since Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of troubled companies would only be guaranteed by the government, but not bought, there has been a belief that the hopeless situation is being ignited.
In an attempt to bring the contrary views together in Congress, a measure was added to provide that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it has to bear losses for five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan includes a first deposit of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the President deems it necessary.
The additional $350 billion would have to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington will get a stake in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends on the profit and which he will be able to resell when it's all over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay the foreclosure procedures for the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected.
The plan's backers would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still unclear whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's quite obvious that Washington is not listening to you", said Scott Garrett, a Republican member of the House Finance Committee, to voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, paying the taxpayers is not the answer.'
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, moderator of the congressional group called the "Skeptics Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully consider the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, the crisis was reaffirmed in Europe as a global one.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of Fortis Bank Group for EUR 11,2 billion (USD 16,3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of bankruptcy since losing EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) due to the risky credit crisis in the US real estate market.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the 10 largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money", said the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is what workers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times".
On the other side of the Channel, the British government has apparently begun nationalizing another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will acquire branches and accounts of clients of the Bank of England.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His blue-eyed beauty long represented his triumph, according to others.
Did this American actor with a charming smile get away with narcissism?
Yes, and no.
The shame, sensitivity and undying talent that he possessed also alienated him from the power category that gives birth to true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at age 83 on his ranch in Connecticut from lung cancer and remains one of the last iconic figures of the obese years of American cinema.
Less brilliant than Brando, who was his closest and longest-standing rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots, one of the most famous faces of the American dream was born.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last mark of quality.
Because it was a country in love with a self-made man, a Pacific war fighter, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumphs in theater, television and movies.
The same civil rights man was also a race car runner who placed second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans and a sex symbol, despite having been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
It also leaves the shadows of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the gossip of her own show business, which will forever remain somewhat mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has caused a dizziness for film lovers, while his big roles are competing against each other on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century after it, it's been a continually changing American art of the seventh century.
The charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) resurfaces in memory, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Roof of the Fire, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From a less recent past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not live up to all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the abused, violent, memorable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which brought Newman to real attention in 1956.
A nice gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful bowler in the stunning Robert Rosson's The Hustler (1961), he plays the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar nomination in 1987.
This face of the ages, it was him.
And then he did.
His career has spanned different eras.
Young people know him best for his iconic Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 on The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He ended his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike some film legends who left the business fairly early, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood for its grace, grandeur and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a living challenge to underplay", judging that he was overly pushing the saw in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as a surprise, the profession wasn't always so tender.
However, he played the first lovers less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and desperates, whose falls and rebellions were reflected in his perfect characters.
As director, Newman exposed the little-known aspects of his shy sensibility.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, portrays a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, who he lost to an overdose, he dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness.
In a tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former fellow fighter Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared: "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
Not to mention his legendary career, he's also a great civil rights, environmental, independent film, Hollywood decadent.
We used to see his image on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies, and other foods, which might seem rather unpleasant, although at first it was a gag.
However, the proceeds from the sale went to his Foundation for Heavy Childhood.
So, rather than let himself be shaken by fame, Newman was engaged to the company at the last minute.
He left a letter to his five daughters, which included the following words: "Your father was always and to the end grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here".
And it was an honor to follow the life of such a bright-eyed and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a good citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & spol factories?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of the criminal case against Janos Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are charged, in addition to other offences, including forgery of documents, with fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organisation, which has caused exceptionally significant damage.
The prosecutor's office said that they used the money raised in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved their tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and local governments - a total of about 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money raised in the public tendering procedure was collected on invoices for which there was no actual countervailing value and never received the commitments made by the association.
The prosecution claims that a large part of the invoices were false.
The printing presses for these invoices came from the market in Josefváros, the round stamp was made in Kiskunhalas.
The names of the companies on which the invoices are to be produced were decided, inter alia, on the route to the northern coast of Balaton, which István Ladose sent János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the first appointment was to look into boarding houses and restaurants.
In these, he requested invoices for his consumption, which were then modelled on invoices submitted in public competitions organised by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the local government of the capital.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his partner András Őrim, who, according to our information, wrote the most frequent reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip", Lados looked into a basement.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, the catering establishment provided food for a group of 90 members from Biztos Pont.
But according to the company's head, not so many people would have been able to get into this facility at once.
In addition, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the foundation Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was also plagued by formal and material errors.
The pension in Badacsonytomai had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the bill.
However, the full-fledged printers of the fancy-filled note exaggerated this when they also listed a company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., whose accounts, according to the information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office, did not even include documents that sounded like Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
The head of Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were on the wrong stamp".
He added that, in addition to the formalities, the fact that they had 100 people on board was also disapproved, since they only have 11 rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the bill also included food, and their restaurant has been closed for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not convinced that the promising Budapest travel agency only organises foreign trips and that the invoice was paid in cash, which was also inconsistent with the invoicing practice of the company, and they foolishly referred to it as a travel brokerage service through Hungary.
In addition, as it emerged from the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, even though the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
In four documents submitted to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. it did not agree, inter alia, on the amount of VAT. The 25% VAT applied to the company's activities is not applied, but to 15%, and the hotel staff only issued printed invoices, but the invoice produced was handwritten.
In addition, the 'issuers' have also annulled the invoice, for example by stating that, as the prosecutor's investigation showed, a company based on investment advice did not carry out a road transport of goods.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Foundation of the European Communities and the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and to the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were false was also broken down by formal deviations - the incorrect format of the invoice and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna K. S. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose officials denied that they were issuing the invoices.
For example, the complainants did not even notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was dining at the company, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
They were knowingly issuing the invoices
The second group of invoicers is those who knew they were to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately 4 million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of Collab s.r.o. allegedly forced one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue a fictitious account.
Zuschlag and its partners also cooperated with Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth approximately 5 million forints, which were not actually economic.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, the organizations forgot to include in their documents.
Another group of invoicing firms includes those with ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian operator of Delta Trió s.r.o., a motor vehicle and fuel business, based in Budapest, but not located in the company.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005.
According to the information obtained by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which had been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The company was run by a man from Romania, who was to hand over documents relating to the company to Ivan Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to issuing invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Egütt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and accepting their countervailing.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian farmers established Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the companies were working, the defendant said, because they didn't get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him, as at the request of the co-defendant, lawyer Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their charters, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Zuschlaga-linked companies Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has issued a total of 15 invoices worth 14,2 million forints to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office ruled that Kubatov had obtained 10 percent of the amounts on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the Secure Pont tendering procedure, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért associations submitted proposals for a public competition for the Mihálye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They received forint 500 thousand, but did not invest the amounts for the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid confusion, TMA has submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a home inspection at the office of Arpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, a portion of the defendants will likely describe the process of invoice production, as they have already done to the prosecutor.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to expose everything himself.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised to explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it's in his best interest - in exchange for paying off a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, maybe the Socialists made a deal with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He may have been offended by the fact that his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely to place him in house arrest, had not been granted.
While economic offenders who have committed much greater damage and have not yet been compensated can walk around freely or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes, he has no such option.
Psychology of trumps: Why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological and economic underpinnings of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers in neuroscience and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to be left behind in eBay auction competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Researchers used experimental auctions to try to map the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group took part in a random auction, where the active brain areas of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the important element is to beat the other side, the entire subcutaneous tissue called the striatum began to work intensively when the loser lost.
This brain area plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system, among many other functions.
The price scratches can therefore be explained by the researchers as an attempt to avoid a sharp reaction of the striat.
To support their theory, a financial cross-sectional survey was carried out by members of the research team from a number of economists.
In this case, three groups bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product concerned was and they made bets.
Additionally, other group members were promised another $15 reward if they came out of the game winning.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost that money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, that one group was emphasized as a winner and the other as a loser.
However, members of the "loser" group were willing to go higher than the control and "winner" group, as confirmed by the neurologist's hypothesis.
"These results cannot be inferred from any previously existing economic theory.
They have thus far explained the phenomena observed at auctions of joy of winning and risk-avoiding.
It was only when neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories that we now came to the third explanation", says Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should I see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is listed as a leading cause of death.
The number of domestic hepatitis infections is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are cured, because the sick often do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a synonym for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms are very similar, with inflammation of the liver and jaundice being the most common, but the causes and the diseases they cause are different.
Depending on the cause of the disease, hepatitis virus is spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses in the blood and body fluids (sperm, urinary tract, saliva).
In any case, travellers should protect themselves by vaccinating against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against C viruses.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, stomach problems, and vomiting.
Then, the skin and eyelids will develop yellowing, light stools, and dark urine, which can take two to three weeks to treat.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious form of the disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that only one in ten infected people is estimated to be medically cured.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know that the cause of the disease is liver cells that are destroyed, and in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20 to 30 years of age.
Therefore, timely prevention, regular monitoring is very important.
The disease is much more common in three groups than the average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by routine laboratory tests, a person should consult his or her doctor if he or she experiences any symptoms of unknown origin.
If detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing infection and preventing cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organised globally by organisations representing the sick in 2004.
It aims to raise awareness of the chronic hepatitis caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early detection.
Who believes in God doesn't feel so bad?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a sort of pain reliever that could have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to study how belief in a god influences the perception of pain in humans, reports the Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre survey, they electrocuted 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists while all observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
A technique that examines the human brain in detail has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that regulates pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies involving academics and scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was performed with the finer precision of a sparkling instrument attached to the left hand of the subject to produce electric shocks.
The researchers asked participants to observe two paintings: the 17th-century Madonna of Sassopherrat and the 15th-century Lady with a Marriage by Leonardo da Vinci.
The authors hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in believers, while they chose the da Vinci painting because it was not too different from the first and seemed to them to be a soothing impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during that time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts while separately viewing a religious or general-themed image.
Catholics reported that the sight of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if they were "taken care of", and "calmed down, filled with peace".
They said that when they saw a religious painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was also involved in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by using any highly impressive image even among atheists, if only the right image is found.
"We need to find a picture that they will see very positively, from the mother or father's perspective", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the study.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, change our personality", Wright added.
After such great results, it's only a question of how the pain of the faithful would be regulated if they were shown some Madonna of Leonard or a painter of similar caliber.
Would a look at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You're what you share
On their tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they've been on vacation, what kind of professional examinations they're going to, and what they're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, that's still not enough.
But for the skeptics who are parallels to the Orwellian dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's primary goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to keep the founders of Google from their original intent, which was: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to a Google official, after ten years of global expertise, the company is still in the early stages of working with all the information it needs.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of work would be right for me?" - but software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until it has enough information about users.
Not all internet users are well aware that the search words are captured exactly during the internet search, including from which IP addresses the search was made and to which pages the searchers moved to.
For example, with Personalized Search, launched two years ago, users can keep their browsing history, look back on what they have searched and clicked on, which in the long run will lead to more personalized finds - and Recommendations, which will offer products and services based on previously mentioned and retained preferences, will be based on the same logic.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? - users who are afraid of seeing Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the threat is more the extent of the potential power represented by the company, the lack of a reaction to guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even rebellion against power among internet users.
However, it is confirmed that all the words sought are not only captured but can also be given to third parties in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the most famous example of recent times was the coordinated campaign against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from Orkut's community sites created through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about privacy rights could still relax in May when the company, in cooperation with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully seized almost 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, which it obtained by appealing for strengthening the Child Protection Act passed years ago, but it failed to obtain individual user search lists, or complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so conflicting: it's being whipped by those who fear disclosure of their personal data because they feel that their privacy and privacy will be compromised by using Google's services, and they're going to revolt against it, as is the case with multinational companies with a conservative image.
And yet American geek culture and its wild underbelly, gathering around them enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big business, a "corporation that's now fretting", unlike its rival Microsoft, which is considered the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both are fighting for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require its users to use an identification code and does not want to pay for their applications; an open, free and ever-fresh source of information and software packages seems much more accessible, younger, cooler than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks are accurately understanding the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has led to one of the most talked about keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, about knowingly leaving traces behind and using the communication channels we have at our disposal, and although they're different in scope for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can create a profile on several social networking sites from Facebook to Xang, which they can easily link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, which records the music they listen to, then connect to navigation systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and write a blog that automatically shows their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickru or Picase.
And we can learn a lot of examples of how it works: a girlfriend can easily remember who her joking boyfriend spent the evening with when she looked at a flood of photos of friends in the morning, or a company can fire an employee just because they posted their honest views on top management on their blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of privacy has been completely reevaluated today.
The online life is about what you show off, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid Google's monopoly has a chance (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google's search engine but doesn't intentionally leave a trail).
For example, a small number of people don't register on community sites to be unable to find them. Google's online apps, from text editor to photo editor and news portal, can be exchanged for alternatives that aren't connected to giant server parks and don't make the highest profile possible.
The public is not too secretly waiting for Google to show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion more than IBM's ($140 billion), Intel's ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola's ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space is putting advertising agency investment at risk, and the services being introduced at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously upsetting the lives of not only Microsoft but many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints that are disturbing: for example, the top management completely rejected the employees' protests after doubling the fees for corporate education, the company's management found that the daily meals of employees were too expensive, but all this is lost by the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government back in 2006 and, in accordance with their agreement, filters out any findings that are in the best interest of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services until they are available, but the fact is that the expected problems of the months and years ahead can move the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project to scan and archive books and magazines is getting so big that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others with the scary Health system, in which we can build a complete personal health profile with its previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can serve as a good starting point for the next generation of science fiction writers, and Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" is a reminder of an Orwell-inspired future where you can get awfully close to a person only with Google data.
Two teenagers helped a double Ozz murderer remove traces
Two teenagers were questioned by police in a double murder case in Odessa, suspected of helping to remove the traces of this crime, said a spokesman for the Borsod County High Police Directorate on Tuesday.
The persons suspected of having committed the activity have confessed and are currently charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
The two teenagers, two girls, are being prosecuted on parole.
The offence is punishable by imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder in Odessa, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a premeditated murder for obvious reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old man owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect refused to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a factory in Odessa last Wednesday, where he killed his husband and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man prepared himself for the crime in advance, which is also evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100 percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, even though the Czechs had already excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60% of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish offer represents the highest amount ever offered to the Prague stock exchange.
According to Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted bids.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with approximately a 25% stake, followed by Česká spórovatelna with 14,7%, and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13,5%.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European paper
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European letters already mention "Second 9/11".
For the global financial catastrophe we can thank the American president, the Roman La Repubblica, for not even being able to shake his own side in support of that fast-paid bill to rectify this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9/11 attacks.
Part of the Madrid press also sees a culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly increasing, and the world will ultimately pay for it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - at a time when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still give a life-saving loop to fraudulent monetary institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move beyond their national selfishness and to unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the money institutions of the world received more than 100 billion euros, recalls Vienna's Der Standard, which says that fears that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets to solve the crisis, are becoming more real.
The European Union is facing a crisis that has been like a tsunami on an old continent that has not yet been seriously addressed.
The "saviors" may not be billions of euros in cash right away, but it would be good if they firmly established when it would be reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
A smart car mimics the flight of a bee
What would be the best method of developing collision-prevention technologies if not to mimic the obstacle detectors that occur in the natural world?
Like the bees.
The initial strategic idea of a surprising project presented at the CEATEC Japan Fair inspired Nissan Beekeepers to build a new generation of collision-proofing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed a BR23C biometric robotic control system, a robotic minivan equipped with bee traits, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"In flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging", explained Kazuhiro Doi, the brand's general manager for technology PR and R&D.
The complex eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers went after the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It shall identify obstacles up to 2 metres in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculate their distance and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which shall be immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to mimic the movements of the bee and rotate the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision, immediately changing direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver of evasion is carried out in a completely instinctive manner.
"If it wasn't for that, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Ando, director of the Robotic Car Mobility and Project Lab.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety-protective packaging, inside which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be upward, downward or even evenly distributed, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless options offered to bees in avoiding them, only the rotational motion, acceleration and deceleration were used in the case of the robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifetime than lithium-ion variants.
Ando says instinctive, intelligent responses are important, not the ability to process, much less the ability to store data.
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few incoming signals per second.
It doesn't need to store and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses memory of a few kilobytes in size all the time.
It doesn't need a memory with a gigabyte or a megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate avoidance that Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced vehicles within 10 years.
Another possibility may be to connect the unit to a GPS satellite navigation system, which would guide the driver to the assigned final destination after avoiding obstacles in the road.
The damned dear child has a name.
The law on a $700 billion economic bailout package to be split into several installments to buy back low-quality bank loans is now in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended just after midnight on Saturday, congressional officials reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, saying that only the drafting of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken".
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8pm CET (i.e. Monday at 2am CET), but no particular increase in the markets was caused.
The draft law, called the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act 2008, to be established by the programme, will be voted on by the House of Representatives on Monday, followed by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the news of the deal was welcomed by the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which was to have a total of $700 billion spent on the repurchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities at once.
Now, it's possible to spend up to half of the $700 billion in the first round, so that $250 billion will be spent immediately after the expected Congress decision on Monday, and the Treasury will buy securities backed by mortgages that are rated as low-quality, and the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the president's decision.
The programme shall be supervised by a special committee, including the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The allocation of the second half of the $700 billion will depend on further Congressional decisions.
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the Act, use a combined tactic: it may simultaneously redeem non-performing loans, mortgages and securities backed by mortgages, or other 'toxic' loans.
The purchase can be made through auctions or directly, the competent officials of the Ministry have said.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with a guarantee of funds of concern, in return for which the companies pay a price corresponding to the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it be large-scale purchases of bad funds, insurance of bad funds, or to prevent the systemic risk of collapsing some of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
Bankers who are in trouble and waiting for government assistance, on the other hand, can expect the government to cut their fees - simply called "the golden parachute" in slang.
The Commission has therefore concluded that the aid granted by the State to the beneficiary is compatible with the internal market.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold parachutes unless the fallen bank directors are sent directly to retirement.
In the case of direct repurchase of low-quality loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the management money is not overused.
It should be added that the existing gold-backed contracts will not change, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which is to be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on the remuneration of CEOs will be in place", commented House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
In addition, the State will have the right to acquire a stake in the participating banks, reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they can earn from the transaction once the economy and the rescued bank are back on their feet.
The draft plan states that the President must present to Congress a proposal for how to reimburse taxpayers for expected losses from the financial sector over the next five years.
There were, of course, voices of doubt on both sides about the plan.
"That's not what the American people asked us to do, because that's not what taxpayer dollars will protect", said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic counterpart from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that the passage of the provisions was pushed precisely by those responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0,1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12,9% in August 2007, the CST reported.
The export sales prices in the industry were 1,1% higher than in July 2008, decreasing by 3,9% year on year.
The prices of the industry were up 0,7% year-on-year, up 3,2% year-on-year, as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1% compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly, by 0,1%, compared to July.
The largest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2,8%) mainly due to monthly price increases in the silk and cotton and footwear industries of 4,6% and 2,5% respectively.
The higher price levels of plastics and chemicals have caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and products sector (1.6%).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4%), electrical machinery and appliances (0.9%) and, to a lesser extent, in the woodworking sector (0.1%).
Prices in the paper industry and in the publishing and printing business remained unchanged.
In other sectors of manufacturing, we have seen prices rise by 0.2 to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sector, which has a strong domestic industry share, prices increased by 0,3% in August, mainly due to the continued impact of the officially fixed increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the individual sectors of the processing industry, the oil processing industry experienced the highest price increase (32.4%).
In the metallurgical production sector, a 13,2% increase was observed, followed by an 11% increase in prices in the food, beverage and tobacco products sector, which is of decisive importance.
The prices were reduced in the textile and textile products (2,5%) and electrical machinery and appliances (0,3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0,6 and 9,1%.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing sector increased by 10,2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sector exceeded prices from the previous year by 18,7%.
In terms of the breakdown by sector, the highest monthly price increase (0,7%) in the manufacturing of physical assets was recorded in domestic sales in August.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors prices increased by 0,3%, in the energy and processing sectors prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16,8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, we saw a price increase of 6.8%, while in the physical assets, we saw a price decline of 1.4%.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1,1% in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3,9% in the 12-month period.
Our domestic payroll has weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, then 7.1 percent against the dollar, in one month, compared with August 2007, by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Next year, you're going to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a high hope that the US-Hungary visa-free travel agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago to leaders of the local Hungarian community.
She said that "almost everything now depends on the timely construction of an electronic system of authorization and controls overseas".
It also pointed out that the new system will not include entry permits, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The Hungarian diplomatic representative continues to hold talks in Washington as of today.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will be awarded the Central Cross of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary and will hold interviews with the foreign policy adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, unanimously assured their support for the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but they are also politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After a marathon of congressional and administrative meetings, it was announced early Sunday morning that a basic agreement on a bank bailout package had been reached.
A financial package designed to reverse the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have been unanimously named the most suitable candidate to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, as economic issues rose to the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and the McCain lead secured after the Republican convention by Sarah Palin's nomination as vice president was lost.
Obama expressed hope at a Detroit primaries on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be passed by Congress quickly.
It stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection which it also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsibly ... to your places, to your savings, to the entire industry, to the stability of the entire economy is at risk", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He never missed an opportunity to call McCain's ideas about economics outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained: "Everyone will be a little bit disappointed . . . but doing nothing is just not the way".
As the Republican senator noted, the proposal includes setting up a committee to oversee the finance minister and limiting the leave of absence for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no more significant role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the German-language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyzes the weak CSU result in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haider family is ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
In an online edition of a left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Father", examines the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the CSU began to erode long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
Christian Socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The interim is a problem for all Christian democracies, including Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday, a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years ended: the uncontested hegemony of one state.
As early as ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, below the 50 percent threshold for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, during the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has been consistently implementing in this country and that is consuming its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they've been very wrong at the pace, and yet secularisation, educational outcomes, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria, could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to increased opportunities, which also has its visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the most distant CSU has been the classical civil society; freelancers, tradesmen, graduates and higher education.
That's already dropped CSU support to less than 40 percent.
The Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation.
In its article entitled "Who, with whom? The parties are reluctant to discuss the coalition", the conservative Vienna daily focuses on the confused domestic political situation created by the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The PSC shall prohibit the interference of the PSC in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens are not yet willing to negotiate a coalition.
The election is behind us, now it's all about the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party chairmen haven't looked at their cards much.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann has confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in social partnerships.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was postponed for each fall.
Repeating this direction is not in question.
Molterer was cautious about red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open to the party, and these issues need to be discussed within the ÖVP.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, once again appeared open to all directions.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility", said Haider.
JAROKO: The enchanted circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equality, which is being hosted by France, the current President of the European Union, has opened in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, MEP from the European People's Party for Fidesz, as one of the keynote speakers of the expert negotiations, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spedl, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunity, on behalf of the French Presidency.
The invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society associations working in the field of equal opportunities met for negotiations.
According to the press office of the MEPs' group Fidesz, Járóková stressed that, in addition to the discrimination in recruitment, Roma are being excluded from the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a high school education and, due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small percentage of them can achieve higher education".
Járóková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The MEP said that awareness of these links should be established in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; he contributes to the national budget through income and consumption taxes.
"It is the right of Roma to be citizens of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and segregated education", emphasised Lívia Járóková.
The MEP said that the European Union's coherence with an emphasis on objectives and action is needed to accelerate the process of school desegregation immediately, and that the proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is paramount.
"The enchanted circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the opportunity given to Roma children by the democratic space must be given to them to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe", demanded Yarokowa.
Each of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' is bound by the objective of the European Summit on Equality, which has been held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the goals of equality and the elimination of discrimination set out at European and national level.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the incumbent Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided by the end of October.
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still hold their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress this weekend.
The members of the highly criticized duo have, in any case, been told they won't stick to their posts.
They tried to appease the angry members of the faction and base who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavarian tsunamis" that personal consequences be drawn.
Five years ago - indeed, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but it was only 43.4 percent strong.
CSU has been a "self-governing" state in Bavaria, which produces 18% of Germany's GDP, for 46 years.
The Conservatives still hold a high position in the southern federal country, which is crucial to the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will be forced to form a coalition.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that the deputy chairman and the Federal Minister for Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible Huber successor, will also be a member of the close intelligence team that will open the probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters.
Ironically, the Free Voters' candidate for the House was Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out a coup, but then with an ambitious communal policy they made a ruthlessly short process.
CSU's top officials are now focusing all their energy on stabilizing Beckstein.
In the transitional period, Stoiber, who has so far been a backdrop leader, called September 28 the most painful day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber tweeted a few sharp remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, somehow rebuilds its strengths together.
According to Merkel, who has been hard pressed to hide her disappointment from the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin-based coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU won't be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria at 18.6 per cent since 1946.
The dress: position - 110:0
In the election on Sunday, not a single opposition member of the Belarusian parliament was elected.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the irregularities that occurred during the vote count.
The OBSE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million country has lacked opposition for well over a decade, the opposition, united under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDF), had been seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who had been allowed to renew his presidential term for a fourth time in a controversial 2006 constitutional amendment, would "allow" several opposition lawmakers to appear in parliament this time.
The ODS has therefore abandoned the previously considered boycott.
Against the background of the opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has taken a loan to mitigate the impact of Russia's increasingly expensive natural gas imports and has also helped to get Beltransgaz, which owns the country's gas pipelines, into Russian hands - has sought to improve relations with the European Union, where Belarus' anti-democratic political establishment and other high-ranking politicians do not allow entry.
The release earlier indicated that the OSCE had focused on positive developments in its assessment of the election campaign rather than shortcomings - for example, a ban on candidates for one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's Monday lightning report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition cannot be present at the vote count.
At the same time, the opposition believes that the political system is improving: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to go into even minor confrontations with Moscow, while still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia separated from Georgia, even though Russia, which forms Belarus on paper as an alliance state, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Alexander Milinkevich told our letter.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, even though she "was too afraid to let a single opposition member into a minor parliament".
In view of the results of the opposition, he is not planning a protest action, but is trying to convey to the voters his message of the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print opposition letters in Russia, distribution is hampered by local authorities, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, even among the elderly", Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers social security its greatest success, does not consider it the right or officially most supported class of pensioners.
"Because of the country's debt and the growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security 'quiet of the graveyard' collapses", says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition politics, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, Sergei Lebedev, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been installed for the arrival and departure of employees.
But from today, this new measure will be effective against the oiled people, against those who peel and then go for coffee during work hours.
The news against lazy people was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maur Maisi.
"The back doors", says Brunetta, "are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services", the minister clarifies.
"Now a new era of accountability and transparency is opening.
It is reformism", Brunetta stresses.
We will complete the installation of the Council Presidency in all buildings at Chigi Palace.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also symbolic".
The Secretary-General assures that there were no objections from the employees: 'It was a common approach with the workers and the cooperation of all.'
In short, no more breakfast during business hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing like a real cappuccino at seven in the morning".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that in three months the absence of public servants for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 people more at work per year".
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"their pay dynamics explains the Minister  have doubled over the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and are far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have rallied to reject Brunett's decree's standards in line with a request backed by Codacons.
"As the Minister of Public Administration today presents figures on lower sickness absences  writes the Consumer Protection Association  the nation of 'urgent lazy' is growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and upright public servants who have gathered to declare war against the illegitimate norms contained in the decree".
The TAR will protest against the exclusion of work-dependent sickness allowances, the extension of the period during which the patient can be examined, the timeframe for inspection visits, and other rules included in the new ministerial regulations.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat the risks of workplace accidents.
Every day in Italy, 2,500 workplace injuries occur, three people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
Inail's figures confirm that in 2007, we have about 1,200 deaths from work-related injuries.
These figures show the seriousness of the disease, which remains a leading cause of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To re-awaken the attention of institutions, social and media about this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Workers' Injury Victims, which is set for the second Sunday in October.
"The alarming data published by Anmilio and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety", confirms President Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to President Anmilio, Pietro Mercandelli, National Association for the Disabled and the Disabled.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the continued joint efforts to ensure safety at work, to protect injured workers, to help the families of victims and to engage public opinion.'
"Naturally, an angry 'dust' has been created, honestly shared in the face of tragedies that have caused a stir in the media and public participation in their scale, but everyday reality offers us dramatic cases again, even repeating in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that 'there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives in the field of education to raise awareness among young people facing the world of work are of particular importance.
It is necessary to raise awareness of this phenomenon, not to give up on its worrisome social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that "the deaths caused by work-related accidents create an absolutely critical social condition, offend the conscience of each of us and force all institutions to make a convincing effort to end this condition".
"As regards the data on workplace injuries, they appear to be showing some positive upturn, but this does not deny that the number of deaths from workplace injuries is alarming anyway", remarked President Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'reduction effort' to lead to less attention, because the moment attention is turned off, tragedy will break out.
"We believe that generally little is being done to stop the problem of accidents and that there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our view, Mr Mercandelli stressed, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the training of workers, from school age onwards.'
"More effort is needed", he added, "in terms of communication and public participation.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon which constitutes an exceptional social phenomenon.'
Mercandelli ultimately stated that this was a progressive degeneration of the level of compensation entitlement for victims of labour and the 'deferral of supporting care' to which the system has been subjected in recent years.'
"The aim is to return the worker's insurance guarantee", he added, "because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or the occasionally bestowal of the legislature".
MP3 players charged, exposing hearing risk
Listening to loud music for extended periods of time and using portable musical instruments such as Mp3 players can lead to permanent hearing loss.
According to a communication from the European Commission published today, which in an official report circulated in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Committee on Science on the health risks that have recently emerged and been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion  we read in the footnotes  it follows that 5-10% of those who have been listening to music with portable musical instruments for at least five years, more than an hour a day a week and keeping the instrument at high volume, risk permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels may unwittingly damage their hearing in irreparable ways", admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings  continue the leader  show a clear risk and need to be reacted quickly.
The most important thing is that we have to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to review existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and keep pace with new technology".
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this issue in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise from this source.
'Scientists  concluded the executive officer of the Eu  confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties that have raised the problem what measures could be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices.'
There is currently a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about the potential for hearing damage caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is very possible to reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing exposure levels and duration.
In its opinion, the Eu Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music for extended periods of time in such conditions risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves the Commission free to move forward for the future of the capital
We start today, we close in March, we have the money in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome, which met this morning at its new headquarters outside the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the Commission will prepare a handbook for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Campidoglio and its councillor Gianni Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas  wants to emphasize Alemanno  He will have to ensure proposals for the development of Rome that will eventually be used by the political decision-makers who remain the Giunta e General Council.
It's not a job exchange, it's just a quest to have a place to work on a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved because these institutions must have a precise deadline.
In June, the Mayor announces that we will present a strategic plan and build on the work of the Commission for the future of the capital, Rome".
To those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of the same quality as the Attali Commission proposals, and I am sure that in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often politics is dissolved in the everyday problems and urgencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither a useless enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, the citizens of Rome will not cost even the euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, to allow our city to rise to the level it necessarily needs and to think in a united spirit about its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome notes, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the vision of a future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital city but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
A well-known American president wrote that it was important to him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president".
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy of Islam".
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman posted on the website: "This man is ambitious.
But Obama is bold: he thinks he can get to the top of the nation's office, which has had two governors and five black senators everywhere!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much", they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president?
Even then, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, wrote a comment: "At least once in the polling station, we know very well who the American patriot will vote for".
There's a side to the American mentality that's been left untouched until the very last minute.
Say what you want, and we'll take care of it ourselves, who to strangle, whether Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear, if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, seemingly a certain success for a black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for Democrats, the primary weapon is George Bush.
When asked by 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his term, 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush.
Whoever takes over from George W will have to do a huge job.
The U.S. economic collapse has been felt by journalists, as well: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about their profession and their future prospects.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly state that they were less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a broken economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where editors work to put together the paper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists in question, this is a problem that must be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change radically in the way it is understood by the general public.
The American journalist is being overwhelmed by a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and senior executives believe that journalism is going the wrong way on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many view as a "press killer".
The "economic pressure" that journalists point out has risen by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted that they resort to technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms -- that is, executives -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at national level are confident their reporters share their values, while at local level the value falls to 23%.
This is for someone who's concerned with job security.
The number of leaders who think they'll lose their jobs in three years is 47 percent nationally.
As for journalists, they're moving at 30%.
As for "safe work" involving staff in America, it's still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it's a matter of taking or leaving.
Managers are almost always paid huge salaries, and an editor can earn up to $10,000 a month in addition to paying pensions and insurance.
As regards leave, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, and up to 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often get sick within a year.
It's just a question of the climate.
A court in Rome, Danilo Coppola, founded in Grottaferrat
The president of the Second Criminal Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppolo, who asked to be allowed to move from his hometown of Grottaferrata to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-bid sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his trial, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked the real estate businessman to change his residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, the court held that this move (against which he had spoken) would have allowed him to influence his society and access the evidence that accused him.
The Elite in Danger
This phenomenon was manifested just days ago when the House of Representatives voted against a rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times report that the current crisis is tearing up the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more moderate, more sympathetic to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to Washington and the world of finance, strong primarily in the states of the Midwest and South.
A spirit that has manifested itself arrogantly in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this is just an example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic quake is already showing: not only in the United States, but in the whole West, and perhaps not just here.
In the US and Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, that are tightening up in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these is a reactivation, an extraordinary market revival, a dual category of state power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have strong links abroad, but which mainly involve the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
Which has created a political problem for those who run it: how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are voters, among others.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the game or to have little to add: the European Union, as always divided between different interests and different state strategies, has given clear evidence that it cannot decide on a common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of each individual state government, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, most importantly, the allocation of funds: at the moment we get into a crisis, only states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to fix everything.
And they also have the means and the authority to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances that no market or international organization can ever have at their disposal to the same extent.
The new emphasis placed by the crisis on the national-state element is in full agreement with the ever-increasing importance of recent economic developments, which tend to be attributed to a closely related factor: territorial appropriations.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of sewing, increasingly sophisticated technology, intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, out of nowhere we realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little intangible things as water, grain, oil.
All things that would be said can be moved from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to a confined space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler is definitely more likely to have more cards in his hand than whoever is not, and whoever is lucky enough to live in a place without grain, oil and water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it's predicting a breakdown.
When you talk about territory, state, government, you're inevitably talking about politics, that is, leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discrediting of existing leadership, especially economic, which has proven equally unsuitable and filled with dark spots.
And together, something even deeper and somewhat disturbing: the discredit, impatience, sense of incompetence and absence that is trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that the belief is increasingly spreading among the broad masses of the population that their actions are not the same as the ideas of the popular elites, that their way of feeling and being, that their culture is, in the true sense of the word, that the elite has outgrown their time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds one branch from the bottom up, but a strong movement to remove the ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in sudden electoral 'fights' or in unexpected changes in collective mood lately, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavonia to the fall of the Labour Party in Britain to the U.S. Congressman's uprising against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, have increasingly difficulty understanding, that is, representing, what, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western society and that the economic crisis is re-intensifying, growing, potentially over-running.
Before that, it would be exaggerated to speak of a permanent "mass uprising".
But we can't say for sure that it means having your eyes open.
Super glue for walking the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity with super glue and walk on walls like Spiderman in the future.
This is the subject of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a 100-pound body attached to a vertical wall with a sticker measuring just two and a half inches square.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that the team of researchers invented is the development of existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon-pin tube.
The glue's base can be imagined as a series of pipes laid like a stack of spaghetti explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko's legs covered in microscopic hairs that allow the animals to cling to each other perfectly.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "is easily detached from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary glue" supplied by Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a connection to electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering .
No superheroes yet.
Also, the University of California, Berkeley, is working on a new glue.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a glue made of microfibers like hair that cleans itself of dust by moving across the surface to maintain perfect fit.
Medicines: never with juice
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these beverages, which are consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their consumption will change their potency or decrease with serious health consequences.
To highlight the risks of both ready-made and fresh juice in combination with certain medicines, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, is raising a new alarm at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: One glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the intake of certain life-saving drugs, cancel out their beneficial effects, and put patients at risk.
Grape juice has already been accused of increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to a toxic level.
DRAGS IN RISK The Italian Medical Agency itself reported this in a newsletter two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
Not only GRAPEFRUIT  According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that can cause medicines to leak.
A long list of effects of grapefruit and other juices.
This is why Michele Carruby, Director of the Department of Pharmacology at Milan State University, calls for: "Such findings are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative lists of medicines you get, and if you come across anything unclear, don't worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification.
Nobel Prize in economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activity.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokean who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political moves.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, the days after Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a New York Times commentary that the second event would be, in terms of its implications for the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that sparked little controversy and was blamed for years, but proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public eye", Krugman declared in late 2002.
According to Lorenz Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is "a very important economist, but also a populariser with a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
It's the day of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal-generation package that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is showing up to the general public with various new features: adding more, much more significant ones, such as compatibility with Apple's Mac OS X operating system and support for the new Open Document Format (ODF) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version, to the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window.
The emphasis is also on collaboration with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document even with a new Microsoft add-on (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting features of some models are the ability to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a graphical implementation model and maintain the original page look.
Still, from this perspective, we can create "PDF hybrid" documents that look like typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has been greatly improved within application programs: it is excellent to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in a text program each collaborator is assigned a comment color to make the identification clearer during the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some of the features of Open Office to the web (on the cloud), and they should re-create the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, the English version has been added to the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the package is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD may also be sent to the home or workplace upon request.
And if the free-of-charge theme can be a catalyst for spreading in households, the Open Office business is a big bet, and it can already count on a variety of projects being implemented in public administration and schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consulting and support services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a desktop processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphics model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering we're almost 3.600,000 today, with the release of the new version, it's possible that this number could be exceeded.
Kohl's test results are positive, too. This is the fourth case of doping.
Another positive case in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the top-ranked jersey.
The story was quoted by the pages of the L'Equipe newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver to be positive on the third-generation EPO, after Italians Riccard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples are those that were taken in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry labs.
If the test results confirm a positive score on Zero, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and face a two-year disqualification.
The report of Kohl's third-generation EPO positive is confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French anti-doping agency, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government of the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed in the top three behind Spain's Carlos Sastro and American Cadel Evans, also winning the top-ranked jersey.
Is Italy racist, too?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only become the last home of the immigrants" accepted with resistance.
Does this turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? asks a long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of a young man named Abdula William Guibre, a Burkina Faso native, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time the ones with "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Also, the new legislation demanded by the Legislature, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the eviction of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of Italy's changing climate.
The tendency emphasized by both the pope and the president of the republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, called for the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students who are victims of high rents - up to €900 per room
The university student rental market is not in crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, the rental unions, renting a single-bedroom can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"It has already reached such a level that entire student populations have lost their right to study because of the overall overly high prices their families would have to pay", explains Sunia's head of studies, Laura Mariani, "a high demand from students in this city has distorted the market in such a way that it has fueled the price increase process that has spread to residents".
In most cases, the offer of rents involves several transgressions: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without a limited rent, and the rents attached to them.
Sunji needs an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices through a tax audit.
If you look at the details of the research, you can see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, the cost of a single bed is about 450 euros, with a single bed room priced from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence, the average cost of a bed is 350/400 euros, a room is about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, the cost of a bed in a double room is 250/280 euros, from 370 to 500 euros in a single bed.
In Rome, in the central university areas (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a one-bedroom, 450 beds in a two-bedroom.
The prices are slightly lower (EUR 550 per single bed) in areas close to other universities (Astiense and Cinecittà).
We'll only save if we move to the periphery: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros for a one-bedroom in the Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, the bed costs 300/450 euros, the room costs 400-600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for a one-bedroom.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a bigger impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rental is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally being noted: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the city destroys historic halls
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without a cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes".
The painting, presented by Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in the major Italian city centres, but also in the rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central urban areas is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the signs of a true cultural crime.
Often historical sites filled with memories disappear, "it's like losing a friend, a friend, a friend with whom we shared a journey and a lot of emotion", says the director of New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Tornador Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes 20 years ago, and which told the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness of a way of life that cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main operator's association, are clear: in the last five years 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed their doors, and the highest bills have been paid primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
The region most affected by closures is Emilia-Romagna, which has lost 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first factor responsible for their disappearance is the rise of multiplexes is that these three regions in Italy have recorded the highest number of new cinema multiplexes: 195 films in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
'The Italian process has developed irrationally' says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, 'it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones survive because when a cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into a multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for operators: the previous government debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical standpoint, it is a shame that the government does not respect the existing laws.
Between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year would be needed to support the sector.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to deal with closures and decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historic centers and suburbs.
The planned rules include tax relief measures for operators and public mobility benefits: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will be given special parking and parking rates.
I like the initiative called Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by introducing other measures.
But it is certain that to oppose the great power of multiplex, traditional venues must improve sound and image quality, because today's audiences are more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: closing the Super Cinema in Bagheriya, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the already closed Rialto or Quirinal on the street Nazionale, where I shared so much emotion that I didn't have to look at the black-dust inscriptions, I turn the other way.
The link between politics and the mob 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city council elections to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group".
The charges brought by the Calabria Mafia Directorate against Mayor and Deputy Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone and Mayor of Rosarna Carl Martelli, who were arrested this morning for outside cooperation with the mafia organization, are heavy.
Also on the list are Gioacchino Piromalli, a former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the nominee of the boss, already accused of crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards as well as common sense", the prosecutor's office writes, when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Piromalimi's lawyer.
"Then they would allow the mafia group to officially enter city halls, "and facilitate the already vast possibilities of control and administration".
The president of the Calabria Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are abundant in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndranghetas, heroes who are still undefiled.'
The arrests this morning follow the arrests last July, which police showed showed the Piromalli mafia group had received final action.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro had been dissolved since 1991, due to the supposed links between organised crime and local government - local politicians have been removed from their posts in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the centre-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He was shouting about the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called on then-Deputy Home Secretary Marc Minniti to answer the question, accusing him of plotting for political reasons, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that the mob group has even gone so far as to request a change in the A3 highway design.
The prosecutor writes that further inquiries against Dal Torrion revealed 'the willingness to move the claims of the businessman, the representative of a larger group very close to Piromali, as is generally known, and to adapt the public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group'.
When energy is born from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It's an infinite deposit that covers more than 70 percent of the earth's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy that have been caught by the eyes of giants like Chevron, who are now trying to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from ocean activity has been studied for over a century, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When oil prices fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy was abandoned, but now environmental organizations and new oil price increases gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of ocean waves.
This would be twice the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear power plants.
And there's also currents and tides and tides.
The giants are attacking.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build the facility in northern Portugal.
When this was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology", a spokesman for a company connected to the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, an economic daily, "and they're thinking about working with us".
The cooperation we're considering is about getting a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission that's necessary to start a marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the U.S. is still mining oil and recently President Bush came up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also tracking the sea energy footprint, and the amounts invested so far, although not detailed, show a growing interest, observers say.
The technology that needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy because they don't know what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not appear to cause major ecosystem problems.
But to produce more energy, we need to use technology with a greater impact on the medium.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a combat system that is interconnected.
The force of the wave moving with the buoys up and down is converted by means of coils and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
Pressure dissolves the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
The power is being delivered to shore by undersea cables.
So far, there are four such facilities in the design phase, which are just waiting for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already generating power for the mall and parking lot using six offshore wind turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during the flow and tide causes the turbines to spin, which in this rotational motion power the generator.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide, after the tide.
The potential for tides and currents is of particular interest at this time, say the Electricity Research Institute.
Although this is an unrelated factor, the tides and currents are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as an energy source.
States like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 trillion in tidal power in 2008 and predicted $35 million in 2009.
