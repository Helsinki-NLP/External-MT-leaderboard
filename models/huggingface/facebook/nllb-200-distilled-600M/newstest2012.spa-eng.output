Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the ex-prime minister's release, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a deal with Russia that disadvantaged Ukraine over the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeals court is obliged to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It required 226 votes to pass.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be determined who is the winner
As is the custom in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it's a question of whether they're moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has put into effect the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will be cut off from their hands.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates wait for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warrior tribes, will unite by the Quran.
In Libya an order will be established which we cannot even imagine and which we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans mentioned above.
It is no surprise that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO's attacks were not led by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shoot-out that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profits.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals have no problem expelling the "crucified"
But without occupation, will oil companies get Libyan black gold with just good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it is possible that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe are hunting down the investor tracker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer only in Italy but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% forecast, France by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, with Germany improving more than expected (0.3% growth than the forecast 0.1%), while France saw a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data were stagnant).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year on year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the CFSP the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is taking shape.
The results are even worse than analysts predicted.
Main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stalled in the fourth quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to pre- and seasonal data, grew by 0,5%.
The euro area and the European Union economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent year on year.
The interest on your 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical levels.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech 10-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany, there are voices that say the ECB should lend in the final analysis.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1-0 and celebrate the qualifying with a 200 million bonus.
The football team is doing the toughest job of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so they will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the party's development in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the local team's collapse towards the end, and also to the excellent play of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very good Czech defense, the Montenegrin did not press until the second half.
The two party losers were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the genius Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so the national football boxes will receive a reward of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes, he's had a good offensive game.
Both teams were just determined to keep the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kickers to the other field in defence, just what the Czech defense managed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed Tuesday at noon outside the facility and chanted death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the uranium-fired nuclear technology center in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show they're willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a recent report found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to acquire nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students prayed at noon outside the Isfahan nuclear facility and then threw death slogans at the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, which would aim to paralyze Iran's nuclear program, Israeli sources say not only the Isfahan nuclear power plant but also the Natanz uranium enrichment facility would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner on the menu
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9% of the school population being overweight and 5% being obese.
Obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment in which it grows for healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children eat, for example, at least twice as often as children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19 percent of obese people had had had fries the day before the test, which is linked to the "Obesity is not a coincidence" prevention program.
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the "Obesity is not a coincidence" program, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
A proper diet and adequate family exercise are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have said they have five meals a day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet", says one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with dinner stuffed
Specialists warn that in healthy development, details are important, as well as counting, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren's families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst part was finding out that in 10% of households, there's no breakfast.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, crazy fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet refreshments daily (70%).
Over 40% of children surveyed are normally active in sports, but between parents this figure is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your own diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years old, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal".
Her favorite foods include pasta, meat, and sweets
"The popularity of sweet drinks is especially alarming", warns the final report of the study.
The main food is the palm, the pasta, and the poultry.
Children almost always reject vegetables and fish and vegetables taste very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who completed the questionnaire after finishing the prevention programme 'Obesity is not a coincidence', a major change in favour of the principles of healthy eating was made in many cases", the study findings point out.
It is a matter of sweet refreshments, for example, where many children would start to prefer regular, running water.
Children would also choose poultrymeat and fish for their main meal more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict their consumption of sweet food and flour products.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, a pin can't fit anymore.
We've been studying with the principal, Alena, (there's no man on the course) how to dress a woman who doesn't have perfect symmetry.
And that's the vast majority of them.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must be able to smooth out wide shoulders, stretch a neck or recreate the necessary curves.
They've given us some tricks on how to make the body of women like Jennifer Lopez stand out, with huge breasts and hips but a tight waist and at the same time not dress it too defiantly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least a piece of extra fabric to suit.
They will certainly not regret it, because clothes that feel perfectly are priceless.
You'll feel much better with a custom skirt than with one that keeps moving, getting up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body may be allowed to wear clothing with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly many different kinds of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all week to get all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assignment, I've got more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous people, who will have to design two dressing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've got to get Miranda Kerr dressed, you might know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it's much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
Dresses have to be cut out of magazines or searched the Internet and printed, then graphically processed.
The moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It's also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with the product pages in magazines (on specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this was told to us by the designer and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three special guest guests cheered up Saturday's conference with information on all kinds of bodies.
The designer Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist can work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a go-go-go (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classically with jeans and a T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and lift your neck to get a totally different picture.
"Play with it", he insisted.
What I value most is this advice: "To get started, you must first know all the rules".
"Then you can break them", said Jakub.
I finally get why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the book than he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (hence, ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides the photos, the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of which are different from what they're actually used for.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is still no clear trend towards using stylists' services.
Even famous people find it useless (I'm tired of my skills, my physical appearance doesn't matter).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to keep in mind that they are very likely to indicate a size very different from their actual size (less).
Then you just have to google and find out if the heart magazines have already written about the topic, if a certain celebrity has gained weight/slightness, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist should not just be oriented to fashion, but should understand outfit.
During your work, you must communicate with the people you meet, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a principal hires you to classify her wardrobe and you complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't just take and throw away everything and say, 'Oh, what a horror.'"
"Find at least a couple of things you can consider and recommend so that someone can put them on", says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This one is fixed around the waist and you have all the tools you need.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, slippers, or impervious ones. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clothing hook pins in front, if this is larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
To avoid being passive listeners and putting something into practice, we have learned to put on the sole of our shoes.
Even during the studio photo sessions, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more the exterior.
And we just dressed and dressed.
We couldn't touch the shoes with scissors so we wouldn't accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work without reservation.
I don't really have those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we've heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that engaging in styling at a professional level is not a rose-roasted path, but I don't care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you compete all over America.
Reviews
A journey, in principle carefree, becomes complicated by a series of improper carelessness from a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but it is of no use if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended.
The new installment, which includes The Run, has raised high expectations even before its release.
It promised to give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, following what was shown, appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre again.
We also wondered what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in total computation points are lost due to absurd errors, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, they cannot even be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible mischief of programmers.
The adventure starts off very well.
You're introduced to a story, the protagonist of which, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he's offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You're driving on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not have the remote feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous installments of the series.
So it's nothing of the other world.
But a walk in the desert, the autumn landscape, or the high mountains covered in snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are occasionally diversified by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
But in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to outrun a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which only makes things more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite a few landscapes in the game than would be expected (specifically there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element doesn't get annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it's one of the elements that makes the game more interesting.
The driving pattern follows the footprints of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with plenty of action is quite suitable for this style of driving, although we can find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything is in order.
But problems arise after a while.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same thing no longer happens with collisions.
Games like this can't be expected to recreate complicated deformities and collisions, but in fact before a hit on any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
Typically, when you drive a very tight overhead or drive around a car with normal traffic, there are only slight bumps, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up running out of control.
Or it ends up completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can make you feel bad.
Reset is programmed in such a way that when you have an accident or you leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes resetting doesn't help, it just helps to learn the given memory stage.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same events are repeated in different places.
For example, in some curves, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, you cannot take them.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, whether you are first, fifth or arriving five minutes earlier or later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see two cars meeting in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must either turn or brake.
It doesn't matter when you arrive, because it's programmed so that the "surprise" will always happen before your eyes.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the timing, you will always be outnumbered by the same opponent in the same place.
And this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at whatever cost.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it hard for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can make the car go away.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it's sure to disappoint you right away.
And it's a shame, because while the model of travel is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if the merit is to take the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the qualifying in the race so that it doesn't dull the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to be careful of the gas stations on the side of the road, because that's where you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American heavy cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread there is also a parallel challenge thread, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you'll get not only medals, but experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
When the driver reaches the top level, several possibilities are opened up to him, starting with the car and ending with profiling funds.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community features available.
One of the hardest things to understand is how the last race in history is done.
You drive to the subway tunnel (passage), where you run in the dark down the tracks (passage).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the convoy of the subway arrives behind you and is taken ahead of you without further action.
In the newsroom we'll probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the game's programming no one thought even a little bit or whether the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant, sometimes even superb, cases.
It is a pity that, in the most stressful moments, the quality of the image is reduced and sometimes seriously.
This is particularly true in accidents involving many participants, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
To please most youth groups, the soundtrack falls into the category of "everyone's father and mother", but one can assume that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble saying The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game isn't over.
Fun is guaranteed, but get ready because mistakes will hit you in the eye with the force of airport reflectors.

The EU Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without barracks".
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles", Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How can we not take seriously his slogan "clear and open about Europe", which he said in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as would be the envy of many lecturers at the U.S. Law School.
Vicenová also weighed in on the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is the criticism, that if he's rude, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say he left everyone baffled, because he takes on his roles perfectly".
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go".
The new position of Foreign and Security Policy representative is explained by the question: 'Who is this EU? What number can I call it?'
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also taken care of the agenda for the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget has to be approved, because of the much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive the most support and which will receive the least?
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreigners, or jargon that people don't understand".
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban Olomouc cheese from us?"
It also aims to make the most of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
We are waiting for Europe of speeds
According to the ambassador, Czechs are known to be Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative rather than the positive.
It also deplored the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, 'What, you guys from the Visegrad Group are staying?' and it looks like he's not making any fun of it".
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is expected to face new, very tough budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new one of the "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area and we have the enhanced cooperation procedure".
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, stay out".
"These procedures will be increasing and will strengthen the two-speed Europe", Vicenová hopes.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be discussed among the Member States, not just among the Eurozone members.
Brand story:
IBM is entering its second century of existence
If anyone were looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy very precisely, the closest one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has already passed a hundred years since its founding.
The basis for this long-term character was laid by the firm's first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became his seal, around which he will build the future giant's life (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully crafted corporate culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century", said during his anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned with the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacation, insurance, fancy uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication holds IBM in the relationship with the customer.
From the very beginning, the company was able to discover talent (as one of the first companies in the world to eliminate any form of discrimination, it was easy to choose).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, which will see Palmisano replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working for IBM for 30 years, where she's been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
Over the past few years IBM has been involved in so-called virtual meetings, an online idea raft, from which endless future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that ideas abound, since the firm employs almost half a million people.
A well-known institution
The firm position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company", says Harvard Business School professor of economics and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology", notes George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there's a difference between getting into business and starting a business directly.
IBM - or the "Big Green" - as it is known in the US by its familiar logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world over the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (it develops both software and equipment, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of any U.S. technology company and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include ATMs, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will turnover this year 220 billion dollars, making it the second largest tech company by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations meet the customer's taste and momentum (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, you can't be emotionally anchored in the past", acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and likewise, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And that's the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which about a fifth is software and another fifth is equipment.
However, even in 1990 equipment accounted for more than half of the supplier share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first appeared.
IBM is acting on the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that IBM has managed to cope with the crisis so far.
The value of IBM shares has grown steadily since the beginning of 2008 to 120%, and the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
IBM's motto is change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will withstand.
IBM history: from the cheese cutter to spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a trademark used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "fixing clock", which allows control of employees' entry and exit.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint signed up the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation upon which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to register boxes.
During the first four years Watson ran the company, revenues doubled by $9 million and the company's great expansion across the continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years as chief executive, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of the time, came to market as the IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which in turn acquired the consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering complete advice and high-value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying for the last three years is the concept of a smarter planet, which means a smarter planet.
The aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or circumstances have not been improved, for example in terms of transport and city management.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the 'Smart Commerce' platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
As early as 1932 it opened a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to do so.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague, and there is also a world-renowned research team here that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still had the hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will not wait any longer and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore", Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how their marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved for thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář broke up with Bartošová one day, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He's the biological father of my children, and if he wants to live out the rest of his life in our house, no one will fire him".
"But here I would live not as my dear old borricane who made a mistake, but as a man with whom I have certain ties", Rychtářová said, adding that she had already untied herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn't mind a woman closing the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision".
"I'll be with Iveta and no change is possible".
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it".
"The company is still going strong, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping".
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is we don't share a bed", Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some of the typical vices of women, they will usually name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are mentioned that manage to make men's blood boil?
Going shopping
You blame your orange-sized half-ass who's addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy yourself at least one trip a week?
Do you like to shop often at the auction?
So in your case, you could say that shopping has become a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least calm their shopping passion a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothing stores, look for tightly fitting clothes, and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you'd better wait for her outside the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do I really like you?"
Don't you hear those phrases?
What's the point?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints are, the more annoying women become.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's like an infinite tiovive.
Clean the windows, run the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the dust, rub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your spouse for treading on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirting a freshly cleaned sink and glass-door shelf that you had so much trouble cleaning?
If you experience this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not occupy the prime place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making unpleasant comments
"Worn underwear is left with dirty clothes".
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"Wet rags are not left on the floor!"
If you do those things to your partner more than once a day, you know that's how you get him out of your boxes.
You don't mean anything bad, you just want to make sure everything's in order.
Maybe if men knew this, women, for their part, wouldn't make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also get slander, gossip, but also offense and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about things together like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us sometimes misses a small, harmless gossip.
With your hand on your heart, this is typical of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women who are uncontrollable, who love gossiping and often do so, who despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's workforce.
Jagr and Voráček helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia .
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought the win over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and again put the Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took a step further and was declared the best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jagr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jagr asserted to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game that I would triple".
"I was introducing him".
"Sometimes they look like ambushes", explained Jágr, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first jump.
A short time later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Voráček made the disc behind the Hurricanes' goalkeeper and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the start of the second half the Flyers were already dominating.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr, he scored the third goal, after his shot fell through the fourth of Wayne Simmonds' goalkeeper's room.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely among the top three", Jagr weighed in on his center.
"I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with an athlete like him".
"I'm very pleased with it".
"I want to play for him".
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results", Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, from penalty, until he put himself at a goal distance.
Matt Read did not allow further complications, although they ended up being beaten by number two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field".
"He blew the disc, I took the speed and Read went to the farthest part".
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I did it", Voráček described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec couldn't take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the back row, and play the game with only five defenses.
"That's not right".
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels".
"Well, but it is that we can do nothing about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist".
"We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc out of our field".
"And so we leave gaps", one of the defenders, P. K. Subban, explained.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions from Winnipeg in the 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorised state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of the time sold in most cases only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, afterwards the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered travel to the West at the time, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend the night like this, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still not all was won.
The so-called "promises of change" that were the condition for travel to the West, were not granted to "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs would acquire.
The way Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
The fact that Croatia, the current favourite destination, was not free to travel until 1989 is a great paradox, which we are no longer aware of today.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed for travel to neighbouring Western European countries, leading to a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs, for a long time, did not seem tired of the Western excursions, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in tents in parks, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czechs at the time was taking food (confections, stews, etc.) with them to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it the average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in travel demand.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 onwards, to regularly prepare travel using charter connections, which brought down travel prices in comparison to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs were traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the United States, which made our travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened back in 2000, when, thanks to huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, and it went to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries have been launched every year.
The exotic countries are visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, and for the first time in their history, they spent over 15 thousand Czech crowns per head on travel abroad, including on the stay-site.
The General Assembly convened to elect the President, who could end up at a standstill again.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the call of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to be held this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, there is still no agreement on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, you cannot even vote to choose between the three candidates.
The Czech football chairmen are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who could deal with football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era ended, a controversy broke out between the two associations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only regarding the election method.
There was no consensus on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that point onwards, and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which full representation is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Single Act.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neuralgia point remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid a deadlock?
"The dispute is whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model", says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the association's leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher percentage of total votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take the meaning away from the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system", is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Tomaš Paclík is also surprised to hear this, although it is assumed that the electoral rules laid down by the statutes of all candidates are more appropriate for Pelta.
"I would like to see it voted as much as possible in accordance with the statutes".
"So that no nonsense about the representatives is invented as in the last General Assembly", says Victoria Plzen, who is running for first time as a candidate and who directs her remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be decided in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All the passions will be quenched with our national team's match today at the European Championship.
"Football will be the protagonist again, and so cooperation will be more convenient", says the Jablonice representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated".
"It's not a conflict between bohemians and moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience".
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly".
"I hope common sense will be imposed, anyway", Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who knows until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be the ministerial meeting, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country's most powerful sports organisation so that an agreement can be reached.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he can't find a more suitable candidate.
If Pilsen's head of football Tomaš Paclik had known before the Extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not have run for such a relevant position.
"If there was a proper person, I would be fighting for her and I would not run for office".
"But until today, we have not been able to find such a person", Paclík told Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the election, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position, you'd like to see an expert and good manager who's not too involved in football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I could consider".
"It was crazy to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football".
"I would like to change that view", he adds.
What is supposedly most annoying to Paclík at the moment is Pelta's relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
It's so unacceptable to Paclík to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the status quo will remain and nothing in football will change".
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit", Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring to Pelta victory".
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us", said Paclík, who also takes some caution from his previous statement that "he would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president".
In the event of winning Thursday's election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The same view is held by the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow".
"He is very capable".
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of the representation".
"but not as an association manager".
"I don't put my nose where I don't feel able", added Paclík, who in September drew much attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitrators' Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, who was later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits he would dare to run the association.
He is also the Director of Pilsen, which won the first division in May with his support.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to its safe practice".
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committee decisions, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport than lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be focusing on".
"If taxes on gambling were to increase, as the political parties are announcing, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going", he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the FAČR President must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically handing over my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the election deadlock.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, the disputes regarding the electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about the meeting on Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute of the last general assembly, so this two-month delay might be good for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new President this Thursday".
"They feel it's time for someone to run the association", thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and the association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought".
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September", Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win the delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails".
"It's a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist", says Pelta.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
In the past, he had already warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his legal training, knowing that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It's been a long time since I attacked Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, didn't leave a puppet with a head.
"He's been in the world of football for over a year, and he's already had some successes".
"His attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign".
"That's why many of them doubt their true character", he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
This one should be a football promotion showcase.
"I would also try to resolve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year".
"I would immediately then engage in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as football president would not involve any personal changes to the staff.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first", he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicted for the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly get over it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR will start working with eagerness.
If the fourth General Assembly elects the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each football area individually.
He also pledged to resolve the Bohemians' case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, raise more money for football and continue the work started by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself entirely to football".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national teams, to professional football or training high-performing young footballers".
"I don't mean that I would do it all alone", Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the executive committee's competencies so that each member can devote himself to a specific area".
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with great momentum".
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticize the work of others", he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step", he explained.
"Many people have told me not to give up, because then others would give up too".
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, no more", he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work he has already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a lot of the work was done that I don't want to lose now".
"There are processes that have been started and will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them", he announced worried about the fact that if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be back to the way it was before the time of Hašek.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him are mostly all those people who would take care of football so that it would be just a privilege for a select few".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I'm in favor of someone".
"I try to be objective.
"I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones", Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I intend to do my best for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division".
"It would not be given the current situation in which we have only three teams from Moravia, which represents a problem for young Moravian players", Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and which knows that behind me there are clear successes", said Rajchl, whose successes include saving some tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating on lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the blame for the Federation not being united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year".
"If elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and will not significantly change the staffing of the committees".
"I don't want to use that to my advantage", he says of his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
I jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible viewpoint, lavish baths in Budapest: Anyone visiting Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a city tour or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbly baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that couldn't be missing in her luggage, a bathtub.
She lay her back on the water, stared at the artistic dome at the top, swam toward the marble angelots, who waited for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist covered pool.
He liked the bathroom, took notes in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true bathroom culture enthusiast.
He doesn't want anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
He is only annoyed that bathroom enthusiasts have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine smell, while joggers can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or hear the cheerful throbbing of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why pools always have to be so ugly", says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools".
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The spattering in the pool and the essential oils in the sauna, the well-being factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are attended to, according to Meder.
And if the builder goes out of his way, the indoor pools can be a real gift to the eye: "Instead of the floor, the bathroom has a water surface".
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The small-format photograph book "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and art history in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the most prominent specimens in her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are nitrate-containing waters in a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal pools, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at Zurich's rooftop pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: the Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while from the bottom the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn't get the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many hot tubs smell of sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gasoline plague is so strong that people think they've reached a toilet.
The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose leather sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a special enjoyment of well-being.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful places for the bath, when she wanted to visit open pools and sunbathing in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, she found a blocked plot of land.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
As Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow modernist building, he saw weeds growing among the tiles.
The decay was countered in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can neoromantic elements from the time of their construction in 1844 be discovered, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bathroom of swimming pool collector Iris Meder, and not only because it's natural to the Black Forest.
"It is very meritorious to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit", says Meder.
In such a palace, the immersion in the thermal pool seems to be of little importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the commodities business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
The hamburger,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not think it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity exchanges are raising prices, and banks are blaming the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocacy campaign is specifically directed at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and are profiting from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be submitted to the Deutsche Bank board, together with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, the commodity business could be reduced or even abandoned altogether.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently hurting the public welfare".
Ackermann is the biggest lobbyist in banking, especially in debt.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio where it puts money at stake for food price bets", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Ackermann deals with the issue of starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first glance, but it's clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board will make a change different from what was not planned on the board.
By abandoning the controversial agrarian speculation, it can perfect its image.
And he needs to care about any losses, and that's what his successor will take care of.
Two thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is working hard to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were betting.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments that generate money from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflecting, to cancel their account and switch to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The relocated flag
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and collapsed.
It's now reopening as an exhibition house.
The modern postwar architecture is passionate, the clear shapes, the glass halls, the bold curves and the new building materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight, floating steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a contemporary architectural landmark.
It made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the Universal Exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna's South Station, was renovated in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was opened inside, called the "House 20".
The building was adequate but lacked the space and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been vacant since 2001 and is falling apart.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opened with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Belvedere Gallery in Austria since 2007, has made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, an ice skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and monument protectors, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the same name foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice for it.
Not only because he reformed Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", where he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its move to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy-devorer", Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with glass fibre was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany shades and protected from oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly like it was before.
And all this with strict control by the Monuments Bureau and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office", says Krischanitz, warning of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, an urban fortune has struck.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, is negotiating with the city on a neighboring site in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train crashes in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The report by Bild, citing an internal crisis plan for the group, reported on the planned investments until 2005 totalling around EUR 300 million.
The Commission has already decided to extend the period of time for the implementation of the programme.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The aim is to clean up snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays also this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacked, among other things, reservations in adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting years for a Federal Railroad Authorization.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a breakdown of an axle at the central station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in fines in the US.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem arises in the US, where Deutsche Bank must pay a multimillion-dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the US is taking over the sector's giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a deal to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial markets regulator NCUA has charged many large banks with inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks to the bottom.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no guilt in the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which was forced to pay $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect clients' investments.
NCUA is trying to reintegrate the millions of losses it caused.
The agreements currently concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also ordered accounts from other major banks and filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
In the case of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results came a few years ago, a complicated wind is blowing for American banks.
Investors and the inspection have put in countless processes to receive compensation or punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most claims.
He accuses the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a claim from the FHFA, it is a business worth 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to report 'substantial losses', without giving an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, is investing heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in computer or information technology companies because the company's long-term development forecasts are negative.
But he's read IBM's trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
You must have understood long before that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for other companies' IT departments.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
So the early Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett recently revealed on CNBC's economic news station that he has acquired IBM stock for $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement until now.
He praised the management who took care of ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful equipment for businesses.
Buffett avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity on a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the world's most valuable companies.
Yet, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and unerring sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stock in stock rose one percent.
The "Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a market value of more than $220 billion and is ranked, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media question the German rule of law.
A newspaper is talking about a "bloody ideology" that is reviving.
The murders of eight small-scale tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, this news has been met with fear and concern.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was long thought dead has returned, since the bombings in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there have been no further incidents of far-right violence against Turks.
Nevertheless, there has never been any question of xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered ultra-right-wing network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is bloody ideology reviving again?" is the title of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant from the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, remembering the victims of racist violence at a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn act marking the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged in happy colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap: "German 50th anniversary gift", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German programme Hürriyet also does not insist on drawing up this mental connection.
"It's starting to smell bad", says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
It points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
On the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the police's behavior and subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not looked for suspects in the far right circle so far.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, they have nothing left but self-defense and weapons".
"This will be the best self-protection".
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the appropriateness of the sanction to the whole network", writes 'Selen'.
This means that if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen will be cleared up in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memorials.
No other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group sentiment on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was then mainly criticized for the deficiency of German policy following the attacks, Helmut Kohl refusing to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated based on the amount of his taxes.
The current information in the Turkish media shows once again how deeply many Germans of Turkish origin have been distrustful of the legality of this country since then.
In addition to the effort to explain and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, this time it is up to the frank.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank Summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber cheers publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves kind remarks about his future teammates.
"USB has achieved a revival".
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A London-based USB financial operator hijacked all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The chairman of the USB board was considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was reported that Weber will be advising the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the board presidency in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard on Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, but rather, an economics teacher and counselor and he's had a period of adjustment that's certainly necessary.
It is suddenly responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved itself worthy of the title of "the biggest bank in Europe's scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been slipping from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis started.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also drunk, was combined with ambitious goals, he also wanted to be a big number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime banking professor in Zurich, explains: "I have always rated USB as a model of a good bank in front of my students".
"From the current point of view, one asks, 'How could I be wrong?'
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it came out that something went really wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund went into high-risk securities losses and had to amortise billions.
To pay for this, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, some of whom looked down upon until shortly before: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard of.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare billions of dollars in losses, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 at Switzerland's second highest paid board, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misinvestments, UBS found itself in financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a binding convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such big banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS's balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than the Swiss economic results (see graph).
"We can't bail out UBS again", said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over data from wealthy customers, who may have defrauded taxpayers with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation per payment.
UBS has thus more or less admitted to having helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for wealthy clients: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank's secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Management Board.
And the exodus of the client funds.
In a few months, the bank lost credibility in its two core sectors: investment banking through false speculation and asset management through aid to tax fraud.
And just as it was getting a little calmer again, just as UBS was thought to be getting it back, this unfortunate operator story happens, a single operator cheated 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Zurich University Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls".
So the idea of the precaution, with which Swiss bankers have long been presented, of being the guardians of the world's greatest assets, arose: no risk too great, but money security wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The Swiss bank security deposits were the symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn't fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its head office in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are lavish, the rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewelry stores like Tiffany's among traditional Swiss businesses like Sprüngli Confectionery.
For years, Swiss banks have resided here: from the national bank to the Credit Suisse palace, to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the reception hall of UBS through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are large leather chairs, next to the bank logo is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small private Swiss bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons".
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was obvious.
"On Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians have granted up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you guys figure?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and it's still growing.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of UBS: a rich but dormant bank with the asset management center in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived on time with a lot of money, which they could use to make a big financial bike roll.
There are two names associated with this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from bank learning to the top".
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And eventually Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality", says Geiger.
"It is a tragic case".
Tragic, perhaps.
The fool arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: "Goldman Sachs, step down".
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of banks at the time.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps worked out for him.
In foreign exchange trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the company advisers in charge highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the banking language of "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Greedy for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It transformed into a powerful machine to securitize American mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought a downturn for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there", said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The positions at UBS became predictable seats and are insecure to this day.
Today, whoever runs a big bank has a job that's almost impossible.
You need to find a strategy for a bank, where all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banking, has an idea, end investment banking, focus on asset management, go back to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must decline a lot, it's clear now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank's new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, since the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has imposed himself: He must run UBS's business permanently, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back to its state in the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But this isn't enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, all he says is that he'll first find a place with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared American investors off earlier this week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain ineffective.
The slowdown in industrial production on the continent is stifling hopes of stabilising the debt crisis at its origin.
General relief from the changes in government in Rome and Athens may not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Standard ended with a 0.6 percent drop to 12,078 points.

The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its output and is at the end of its boom.
In September, companies produced 2% less than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistical office.
What created skepticism among American investors: "We're not an island, if not dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot get out of recession so quickly, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it's still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
It is therefore too early for them to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws a decade-old principle aside and enters the US tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the traditional consortium's share price and makes it price against market trend at first only a higher percentage.

Smart greases are spreading in cities
In many places, greyhounds are considered "problematic birds": these intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for long, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, greyhounds have been part of the city's image for years, but in many municipalities the neighbors are accumulating complaints about the filth and noise of the animals.
Although no means of fighting "problem birds" have been found so far.
Greys are no longer leaving cities, say experts at the first symposium on greys in Leer, eastern Frisia.
There, specialists from across the country discuss possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grains from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture are clearly ending traditional living spaces.
Hunting, the growing building and the falling trees that house them make life difficult for birds.
The fat guys are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the greats of the district leapt to the negative headlines.
Critics have described the hunting of animals using bird traps and the killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expulsing them and driving them away normally doesn't get anything", said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscape designer from Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees away is usually an unintended consequence, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert in Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere".
Hospitalizing them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them".
Without the surroundings, the problem in cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and feeding them to settle elsewhere is possible.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against treating animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can handle a peak in the face with aplomb".
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger's gravel teaching circuit in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion about criticism of bird noise: "Everything is a form of communication, it has a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grey ones not only harness resources to access pieces of skeletons, but they also make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge tested the intelligence of birds in four grades.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a rock on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape the stone must have to fall onto the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning fat guys had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva on a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with the beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube thrower.
Three of the four fat guys got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope for the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have all seeded the last tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored 6-2 (2-1) against Bosnia-Herzegovina and, after the 0-0 draw of the away match, made the five consecutive Eurocopa appearances.
The Czechs won 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs return match against the outsider Montenegro, after they left things clear in the away match (2-0).
Croatia did not allow him to score in the 0-0 draw against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 draw (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals from Portugal.
Former Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a straight free from over 30 meters to get the lead on points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his talents to score from a distance and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not play in the first half hour, had their first clear shot thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player, leader of English Manchester City, sent a head-on to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek was right for the Czech Republic
Then fellow student Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark pitched a controversial penalty kick after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion qualified for the Eurocopa for the fifth time in a row.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga league champion Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to overcome a reaction second in the opening phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflex a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front turn, right in the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the long-handed world-famous goalkeeper, the forward of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end decided the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey has taken advantage of the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks went 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to give up his seat on the 2002 World Cup third-place bench, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks were almost getting a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to hit the pole.
After the second reaction, Croatia took increasing control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made a stand against Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga's legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni is going to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish are taking part in the Euro since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, which won 4-0 in the one-off match prepared for a preliminary decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied the game with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first big shot.
From the very beginning, the Estonian defense avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he got ahead.
After a goalkeeper Pavel Londak's defense, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, scoring 1-0.

Personal massacre
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story of World War I, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one's soul fall to one's feet.
Here are some action tips: Roll this page gently and turn it into your brand page.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novel narration, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is an unusual book, which you rightly describe as "an anti-historical work".
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists, or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened".
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from standard history books.
It's also a corrective to the notion that World War I was just the deadly trench war on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods these people's lives like a natural disaster, a stinking Katrina hurricane.
When gunfire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's home with your children, do you stay or run?
Anyway, who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"The lack of facts", notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and the Pain of Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the High Seas Fleet.
His stories have been mostly obtained from previously published memoirs, letters and other material.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more alive in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and coping with what's there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Sucedaneans, everywhere substitutes".
"Coffee suitcase, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He goes on to talk about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into lamb fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
He notes that "837 meat substitutes are permitted in sausage production, 511 coffee substitutes registered".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive toward savagery and speaks out about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are meant for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whisky, the evening newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy, stuffed fishpond".
But a British soldier realizes that he's probably going to die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public", he writes.
Rather, it is horribly like "a condemned one being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition", writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories".
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young century bestiary: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in fine clothing who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both unholy and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a prostitutes' venereal disease as a way to evade frontline service.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and stuff their genitals with in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose is agile but not extravagant, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he reflects the way war has "unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No Novelty at the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like you came from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday through Tuesday night because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was plagued by challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as pepper spray spraying on protesters, violating departmental regulations and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupations".
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations in other cities had developed.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye facing Zuccotti.
The officers increased the so-called disorder training - counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
Last training session was Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
Orders to enter the park came in "the last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know who were called for this, they weren't told it was to enter Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department".
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers tried to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters showed up early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going back and forth from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do it when there were fewer people in the park", he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with headlights and speakers were congregating at the intersection of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages echoing from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left.
No stores were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if detentions were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent them from seeing the police in action in the park, and that they had been treated sharply by the agents.
Mr. Browne said the mobile TV units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved westward through the dense web of protesters' personal effects, including bags and bags of paper and plastic garbage stuffed with clothes, teams from the Cleanup Department followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, and images appeared on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter locked themselves together by their arms.
And two people chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleanup operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "distortion of public order and resistance to authority", he said.
The highest-ranking agent at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the department head, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief detective, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while he was present, "was not directing operations", Mr Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to get in.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
One of the loudest actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air out of the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came flying out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
The support workers union will sue the city for redundancies
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, District 37, in its effort to revoke the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school helpers, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Officials from the 37th municipal district said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and it has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokeswoman for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's poor areas to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees because they had been underfunded chronically.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.D. District 36's budget fell 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that secondary school principals may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired", says the draft complaint, "and not just in surplus".
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the US involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat from Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican from Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent from Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "bravery".
"This resolution is to honor the brave Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan statement of support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libyan debate has been easy until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting with each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and never made it to the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory -- with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO's mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate might be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience to free themselves" and "praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The final version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's leading Republican.
The spokesman for the local authority said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican from Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to get their amendments to the Assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicate - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations on each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and a handful that "will control federal spending".
Some of those bills are also identical, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat from Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a permanent proposal, as is one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the Members have been about proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Battled but not defeated", Giffords says in his first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after a gunman shot him in the head at a constitutional rally in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune "The Sun Shines Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News's "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult journey back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and punctured the left side of his brain, and that went from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back to the House by surprise to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Good enough".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special "20/20", which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope", being published.
The special was about Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar running through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A frown of lips.
And then, her first word, "What".
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing alongside therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being medicated forcibly while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard".
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated".
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever".
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
At that moment, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines stormed their posts around him.
The tag crowd stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as some kind of orphaned child", the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
He praises the troops for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls".
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about compassion are held quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was a "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding job from Washington immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions", Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II", said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of a service member's suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they've endured, the number of friends they've lost or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his base at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm", says Lyman.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"He's from Texas", she says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts".
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the lawsuit they have brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver proper justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's top plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure", he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he's going to file several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure going.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service", the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: Between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the military to modernize, too, Burke says.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are underway, besides yours.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnosing "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense's Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the attacks are remarkably underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, accounting for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half as many as in the civil justice system.
Plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as witnesses to the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the living room".
"I was put in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, "That wasn't his judgment.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dismissed from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at the George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on".
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a staunch critic of the Ferris Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same incentive and deterrence that responsibility poses.
He adds: "The odds are against them strongly... but it's important for them to try".
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will queue her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place", he says.
"Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a July massacre in Norway that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not that difficult to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's shroud of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic features with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then ran ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
By reaching out via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a way, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen".
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in "Likes", wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom, driving the number of academic papers with the site's name in the title to nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You'd have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access", says Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all that -- you go to them directly".
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many status updates with his booze.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children who otherwise wouldn't be diagnosed".
Facebook is also constantly "picking" its own population for data.
The site's Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of voter turnout in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - longtime digital freedom advocates who argue that the site should make its large amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends".
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know what part of the information on a user's profile and wall messages is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper subject and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social -- and a lot of social stuff still happens offline".
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brains behind the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance at the Oslo courthouse.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway", he said before a room full of 500 people.
"I object to the court, because it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I admit the facts but I do not plead guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who delivered a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from access to the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm he's locked up.
All attended with the aim of advancing to the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman", a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked the journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined he was not a mental patient, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may find comfort in the fact that the July 22 attacks appear to have been carried out by an extremist rather than a radical group.
But that does not automatically ease the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't", said a relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed that way".
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs's Lost Interview, Played at a Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that was dusted off as a preview of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a self-acclaimed designer, dreamer, and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat down for over an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
By that time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during their transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy was discovered on VHS in the director's garage.
This little re-edited archive footage is the basis of Steve Jobs' 68-minute, lost interview, which arrives at Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there's great silence between questions and answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to move faster toward topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there's something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read post-career reviews of Jobs, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, the eager dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I've always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done".
Nobody knows why they do what they do, in business nobody thinks things too deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs goes into detail about his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Confused by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done in good faith, and then adjusted to a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope joke:
Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" that he built himself with Steve Wozniak -- a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
There's been a lot written about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you were yelling through the public phone and coming back a minute later to the public phone from the next door", Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world".
We didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees".
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode-tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a ride to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Early in his career, as he was devoted to selling a handful of base plates, he was asked by a client if he could assemble the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 credit days, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a $300 mouse], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and that was totally reliable.
About the big companies losing their strength:
Long before he led the Apple revival, Jobs predicted how many industry leaders would stumble upon his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it's this kind of people who end up running businesses and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the decision-making forum.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position is rotting because of people who don't have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary craft.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the defeat from the victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There's a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows".
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make -- some things you can't make that electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain -- these concepts -- adjust them all at once...
It all comes down to taste -- it comes down to trying to expose you to the best a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What made the Macintosh great in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas are having dinner with rivals in the health care law while the court accepts the case.
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were stabbed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study the petitions for review in detail.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit to processing and, in fact, a historic 5 1/2 hour plea is expected in March, and the result will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing when the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be thrown out will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has for many years been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner?
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of junior federal judges.
If they weren't, they would be said to fall under Canon Code 4C, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or be on the program of such an event".
However, Scalia and Thomas's absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a firm with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several magistrates that the court follows for the same rules that apply to all federal judges", said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were lured into a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court".
Their appearance and participation in the fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they too easily mix the court's activity with the agenda promoted by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in the trial court.
Her critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from looking into the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record order of $18 billion
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than a billion dollars.
It's rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sales price for all 50 planes is a record $18 billion.
It's as big as the place Boeing got the order from: Middle East, a gold mine growing for future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for their dollar value - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil producing nations.
So not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it's one of the biggest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money from the rise in oil prices.
That's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection", he said.
The UAE order solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS' attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft at bay.
Boeing's air show victory comes four months after Airbus said it was delaying the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president, apparently defeated in the Michoacan vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she claimed on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... they seized the polls, they set up barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and victory at Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly overtaken Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the governorship, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It's President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left local candidates out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as Michoacán's election may seem, a victory will help propel the party forward.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of next year".
BASD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone bail out its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede growth in Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two fastest-growing major economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC countries that look at Europe's difficulties "unbiasedly" and said that Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune".
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means".
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to unite to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth".
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"Some day they'll realize that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that's not going to go well", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs in poorly run, loss-making companies like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "important chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast for 7.5% economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that the looming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a chain financial backlash from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "secuestration", would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects unable to be executed - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to dismiss civilians in order to meet the objective".
"These changes would break the faith of those who maintain our army and seriously damage goodwill".
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in basic budgets", Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract supporting the war".
"Wages paid staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in wartime, and legal and political support would be interrupted".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We are firmly against this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result that can be lived with, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves".
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly candid about possible cuts, even though he got a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without bullets".
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries".
"Indeed, he invites aggression... "
In an appendix to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta details new details of how the reductions "create significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and engaged previously around the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new shore fighting ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it's the next vital step to improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the latest headlines shows us just how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy swapping accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a mockery of his denials quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are a lot of legends about school and college exam traps.
There have been cases where teachers have given the students their test answers in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves in?
On any given day, studies show they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure, a lot of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "locating lies", is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim, "I have you", cheating detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush or get nervous.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation and timing.
I spent several years probing the scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-directed lies", while women tell more "other-directed lies" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they usually tell tend to be "big").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline".
It helps to provide benchmarks for measuring changes later.
Look at the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristics.
You better know if someone normally kicks their foot all the time so they don't make unfair accusations when they see their feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of misleading, verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these behavioural groups as warning signs, not evidence of deception.
Cheating people can freeze their upper body trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, significantly change their posture or exhibit a "post-interview discharge" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators make it seem that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
It also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson got his foot in the door and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
Cheating people can also use distant language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... as far as I... as I understand it".
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There's no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to detect deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding being victimized by the artists of the scam in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan was diverted following the threat of delay in U.S. approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company looking to build the pipeline says it's willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid areas of the Nebraska Sandhills and Ogallala Aquarium, a vast underground water supply.
"This is a real path to progress", Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a State Department request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, you would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquarium, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the TransCanada-hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco music diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a crazy woman in the lobby of their Manhattan building, scaring her little daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers", her family says in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when the carpenter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Somebody came up behind me and said, 'You know what your daughter's doing?' I said, 'Yeah, and I went to get her,'" she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman in anger.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'
He got angry and started using bad words-- the C word and the J word out loud...
I had a bottle of water and he started throwing the bottle of water over me".
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the girl's mother.
LaBelle jumped on her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and pulled into a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but she didn't get a response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on the incident.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her behavior", Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed at a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms".
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa have increased, foreign investment has declined and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-appointed of change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development is recorded.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities for the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report on effects from frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of cultivated land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were damaged and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially damaged.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people throws to more than 74 thousand Sinaloenses unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation that was passed in congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illicitly it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something", he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state to seek work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entering, and secondly because entering they already have many difficulties of finding work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise", he stated.
Informal
The analysis of the Sinaloense labour market is aggravated by the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being quoting as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informalism, the state's labor arrears are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloese workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contracting of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Economy Secretariat from January to June of the state FDI amounted to 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
The State Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the context of economic contraction, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 billion 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés's government shows a lack of management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the state government.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good march already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events like the frosts of early this year halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the freezes, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below expectations", he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he stated that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated", he said.
I work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better guides the Government's efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term programme is developed", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can only say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done", he said.
They're convicting him for eight pounds of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic reported that the narcomenudist sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pick-up truck carrying a black bag in the car's box and a small backpack in the co-pilot's seat, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains interned in the Crime Legal Consequences Enforcement Centre.
Debt on contributions for works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescate of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda said.
The director of Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk because the State Government has not fulfilled the contributions that correspond to it which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He noted that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 percent and that until now only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part", he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not meet the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide at that time.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending", he said.
Although there is a commitment from the state authorities to meet the delivery of these resources, he said that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite the efforts so that the percentages corresponding to them arrive as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is coming to an end they haven't given us a fifth".
Court validates "analog apagón" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have put up against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogous apagon" from 2021 to 2015, by not gathering the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television concrete.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and while admitting the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers decided to dismiss the demand put forward by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister-president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not believe that if I did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the Federal Executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the State rectorate.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and it translates into better use of radio spectrum, improved signal quality and more channels.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the protection of workers' rights in the Member States is a key step forward.
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompassing a group of responsibilities that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, yet without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6,74 acts.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to data thrown by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just 27 percent, yet without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total acts.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As you will recall, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution nor his Electoral Code of the State or his Law of Electoral Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal term to be completed so that they could enter into force in the current electoral process and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the deadlines provided in the Law of the Official State Periodic, with the argument that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the state president's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal", since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
In an interview with the IEM General Council on the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal said that the approval of the relevant guidelines would allow the local electoral body to carry out partial and total counting of votes.
The partial counting of votes in one or more electoral packages may therefore be made on the assumption that: the results of the ballot papers do not match; the ballot papers do not appear in the file of the box or are not held by the chairman of the box; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the ballot papers.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all electoral boxes may be made where there is evidence that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the candidate who came second in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition which nominated the second candidate.
The total count of votes may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the candidate allegedly winning and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages which have been partially counted shall be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation the election of Morelia is located, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday were carried out reconnaissance and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the College of the Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him because they said he even dived in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopan for his family's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
They say goodbye to you for the last time.

They're locating three abandoned bodies on Cadereyta NL estate.
Hours before the find, the military authorities presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place 1.5 kilometers from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place noticed that in the fifth, whose bar is beige with coffee, there was the door open paired.
Looking inward, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow beach jacket with dark, unpainted shorts; next to him was another with a white striped beach jacket.
Just under a meter away was the body of another individual wearing red sandals and blue shorts.
The three of them were facing each other.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people were reportedly killed elsewhere, as no skulls were found at the site.
The barda of the fifth is a collection of legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, as well as several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine inhumations.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster
Italy's appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to present the new government facing a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present the president with the outcome of his talks with political parties in their attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well outlined", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy grapples with a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore the shattered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the market instability put the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to bail out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a devastating new attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure by Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll end his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the eurozone's current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are held.
Monti has said he would like politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of his fears over a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish brush is superior to the tics
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have overtaken the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called in reached the 50 meetings.
A stark contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, account for a broad record of A-class inter-selections, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
That figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Liga de las Estrellas and in powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain an intense activity each year in domestic league and cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
In addition to this, he has had experience with the Spanish Fury in difficult European and World Cup qualifiers.
Ticks, on the other hand, have limited international contact in a zone, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record in the Spanish national team is that of the archers Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exporters Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain with 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernandez, the Barcelona brain driver, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariete, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and nearby Michael Umaña, are left-wing Junior Díaz, with 48 attendances and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least of them.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are among the top performers.
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still not debuting.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the record holder with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-decade-long tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality for them.
This was confirmed by bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American leg of its two-decade-long tour of work and on Sunday 20th will be making its only stopover in Central America.
They will perform at the Estadio Nacional, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the angeline band The X and the natives of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is on The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what his fans are going through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I wonder why there's a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the days before.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that's got us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf, and that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What are you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good, diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the reason for this?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've accomplished?
Yes, I certainly do.
First of all, I don't think either of us imagined we'd be in a big rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and we're so excited that we can keep making music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be any better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a key part of the rise of grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of that big band group.
We're very close friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
Every now and then, a band from a city comes along, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them once in a while.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them still and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a band like yours is kept together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is a lot longer than many bands last.
First, I think we're all lucky to be alive and second, we all care about others.
We're all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened up that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, yet thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don't be on tour too much because it's easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you have to respect music and what brought it, without being captivated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and most importantly, we're still very close friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing in his mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them I could talk about all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge relevant even though it's no longer a fad?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came out at the same time, and, if there's any relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it's become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them on me, I cried when I heard them and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is re-admitted for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in his legs, his chief medical officer reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including tongue cancer for which he has undergone four operations and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He had four operations for tongue cancer, a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other conditions have been added, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Police Special Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and comprised of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, high point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations", the South American Presidency said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French president Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that prompted Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultation of its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairman of the G20, a group comprised of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, since November and has been in force since January this year with the South American country, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to exit the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigot fountainman goes through the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the glasses-free stereoscopy should work", said Nintendo's Spanish spokesman Omar Álvarez during the video game's presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", as until now hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "easy" to hook up less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced players will be able to take a "second turn" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also means the character's return to a portable console, a fact that had not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous installments, consisting that the mustache fountainman will have to travel through mined platforms of dangers with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has processed the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
This ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was in line with the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered extradition.
He said that during his term "he did not get his hands on" judicial resolutions and handled all extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did was an executive process after all the judicial and constitutional procedures to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004 were exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the discharge of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The first 25 years of life of the social support institution Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over the past quarter century.
In addition, there are currently 100 long jobs for this social group.
The anniversary was celebrated yesterday at an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighbourhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, no work, problems with dogradication or in a situation of marginalization.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of officials from institutions and institutions who have been collaborating with the association for 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of Trinijove's work.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Education Counsellor, Ernest Maragall, and the current ecosocialist deputy mayor and councillor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
The current Benestar Social i Família counselor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large room of the Fabra i Coats.
But he said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President set Trinijove as an example for how to fight bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not new to the entity and to the work it does", he said.
An occupied farmhouse evacuated where macro parties were held
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday at noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the 51st Street Balmes neighbors were living has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building they occupied illegally yesterday at noon voluntarily, and where they organized macro parties that desperately despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for a police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be access control", the administrator said.
The occupants, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited -, took all the electrical installation and part of the water, painted the walls and left waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and desperately despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club points out that the invaders of the estate made unfair competition, since they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the club they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, she pointed out, the inconveniences are not caused by the customers of the disco but the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to angry neighbors in the area.
The manager of the club explained that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and nine months ago she "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to evict immediately the building to end the problems of coexistence and civism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the occupants had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some even there have been thefts.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incisors that have been generated in the estate".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 pm, police arrived at 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity to call beyond fees controversy
The municipal competition on the 16 gates reopens the debate on Collserola's role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional pasquines for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was again situated, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the boar in the role of the Yogi Bear.
It was there until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door is a reference to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Or that or someone's trying to put doors in the country.
The question is, collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both purely organisational and reflective of the city, is the subject of discussion among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to get your hands on when two members of this ancient elite caste recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between the opinions of three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Módol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is from the very beginning that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it's very accessible.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title "Collserola doors" encloses a "lexical trap": we must not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where we must act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban planning world, calls the "intellectual challenge" proposal "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty of projecting public space" in the 1980s and the experience of "singing the swan" in the Forum area.
The first fear is the very delimitation of boundaries on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is setting the next step", that is, its overriding.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can lead to real disasters".
More closely to the question, Mòdol considers that, simplifying, the Vallesan side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not", by a mere topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the town hall offers to its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this is the technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a hit", he points out) that have had to create: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the basis of the competition a global vision of Collserola is missing: "16 cross-sectional competitions have been convened - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in all 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In its view, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Ronde should provide for an area of equipment which would allow a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazabaal and he'll be released
After 72 days of confinement, the legal proxy at Casino Red granted pardon to the mayor's brother from Monterrey for the process that followed him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal proxy of Casino Red granted him forgiveness before the Second Penal District Court, which is following a process for blackmail against the mayor's brother in Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García made a series of photographs and videos public in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota for the regimental municipality to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother Panista and on September 2 he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Patrimonial Deeds, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Barrio of the state capital.
He remained there for the 49 days following a second order of arraignment after the prosecutor's office discarded the crimes of cohecho and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta penal court for allegedly blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; however, he only stayed a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was turned over to the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonas' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, the legal proxy of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor regio; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the agent of the Public Ministry assigned to the Juzgado, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal forgiveness and subsequently no claim can be made about the process that followed him; in addition, no compensation for damage or punishment will be required.
After the hearing with the legal authority of the gambling house, around 15:50 Larrazabal Bretón was ordered to be released immediately.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been forgiven legally and his file will be archived.
You will also be notified of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right ones to fly.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the requirements necessary to transport personnel.
He also said that in the investigations carried out in the impact zone, no parts were reported in the ground.
"In a search there are no reported pieces or components of the ship elsewhere, impact was presented in a structural manner.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements for transporting passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees inclination.
The secretary said that the results should be obtained as soon as possible, but the investigation could take several months, or even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said the helicopter of the Presidential Staff was operating at cruise speed and was on a soft, upward terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact", he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed under visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM placed suitable conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advanced to the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico layers of low-altitude clouds were present.
Routes selected:
It is likely that due to the cloud conditions the crew has been looking for a lower elevation area and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the aircraft match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available to date suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and sideways path.
The pattern of dispersion of aircraft debris allows to assume that the helicopter impacted the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the scene of the accident, there is still no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire in the wreckage.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the site.
During fieldwork, aircraft parts have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he was predictably disarticulated along that route.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search of a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, reinforcing the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Security conducts research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Speciality of the National Medical Center Century XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population, whether or not entitled, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Western Mexico State) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
When celebrating World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he said the aim was to bring together 3,000 children and young people aged between six and 14 years old, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (genetics associated with childhood obesity) were applied to all participants.
Cruz Lopez noted that this research is in response to the concern of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys showed that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity among boys and 47 percent among girls; in terms of overweight, there was also a dramatic increase,' the IMSS specialist noted.
He said the justification for searching for markers is that the country's population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows detecting whether they are overweight or obese.
He even said there were dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in his neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is kept confidential, and doctors give it in writing to parents, who are told about the measures and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the television and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, high fat, protein and high carbohydrate (tams, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) and genetics analysed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would prevent bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a better-performing mixture, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals that the paving sends were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baches each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of building and maintaining an asphalt paving is the right one, the baches could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
At its conference A technological opinion of the batches, given in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some northern cities, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltene, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that streets in Mexico City are mostly covered with flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that make up the folder, he noted, is bathed in asphalt.
By moving vehicles and generating effort, this allows forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On top of the asphalt, abundant, is placed a final layer called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will come into contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling stock also needs to have the right thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil becomes wet, the water diffuses into the inside of the folder and is difficult to get out, causing all layers of the pavement to soften and thus to form pits.
In the process of forming a batch, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to at the first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The National Investigators' System member explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement should always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to prevent bumps from forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair the shells easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from the Valley miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not reaching the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of Princess.
Once again the Cauca Valley is left with the wishes of Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucana women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Mary Rose Alzate (1983), Maria Olga Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many people ask themselves today is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that got queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to designate her First Princess is that she was not convinced with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
To the questioner the Caucasian valley replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of getting cultured, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
I'm currently reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I'm reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called The Burning of Blood".
A response that he disliked firstly for the term "culturing" and secondly for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book".
Among the hypotheses put forward, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovationed and the candidate who carried all the preliminary prizes (Gastronomy Oster, public vote for the best artisanal suit, and Queen Mother), "that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton Beach and his two parade at the coronation night.
Although she looked safe in both, she noticed that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the RCN channel's "As at Home" program, said that Melina's appointment as a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest is not queen".
Besides, Valle was the last one to be very elusive with the press, and that's where he got it wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensibility, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the derriere and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
The queen's trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem with fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very noticeable, dropped her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the valley caucus were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her stronghold and here she was charged".
For this award, which for the first time presents the National Beauty Competition, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel Vatican emerged that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the container that Raymundo gave to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her crushing passage through Cartagena, eluded her crown.
That was the work of the hammer who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the highest head of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the cotejo of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the CTI section, that week was the turn of "disponibility" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
When he started his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to intern for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and, after completing the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the Alfonso Cano operation, Eliazar was warned to wear minimal clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry the decadactilar card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, which was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplant and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints on the corpse to those on the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top head of the FARC.
Searching for the footprint
For a Dactyloscopist from the Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can become key to solving crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, the lofoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are caught, many criminals present false IDs or have no papers.
We take their fingerprint and search the database.
The investigator said that in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of a wall from a house, since the thief had held his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts", he recalled.
The prints can also rule out or reassert suspects in murder cases.
A man was recently found dead, with liquor bottles around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could be a suspect in the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle matched it.
Although this doesn't guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that on the objects "the prints are removed with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", the CTI expert said.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective coupling is made.
The "outraged" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of the population complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby parakeet.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under a court order, the Manhattan Square from which they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another park on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were gathering in front of the Zuccotti square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indigned" to camp again at the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to get back to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful meetings and demonstrations", said one of the spokesmen for the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the "indignant" response to their camp eviction personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the Police went and proceeded to detain some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while assuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says several hundred people had settled in the area, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved to show support for the movement and tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a private property - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of the court order at this time and even handed them over to the agents guarding the plaza, which provoked "some small clashes", Bray said, who denounced that some officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order forbids authorities to evict members of Occupy Wall Street or apply "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibit protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install camping stalls and sleeping bags.
The regidor personally defended the eviction carried out in the early hours of the morning from the Zuccotti square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the plaza to be evacuated because it was becoming "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to hurt other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"This morning's eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than American workers", the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "lack of respect for freedom of expression".
The officials of Occupy Wall Street also said they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a television Christmas special.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", backup on "Baywatch", "Playboy" bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 bringing a very special Virgin Mary to life.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread internet distribution of a home video pornographic in which she appears alongside her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "fool" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, Japan's economy has been crippled, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe Japan has suffered since World War II.
Tokyo government estimates of the material losses at $300 billion were first reached, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the surge in purchasing machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1,1%, compared to a decrease of 0,9% in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulse to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use shortages to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakening, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the murky US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products become more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float is determined by the health of the big tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak performance between July and September on the yen's price.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is not slowing down.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most Member States showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average, which is at level 100, falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is feeding doubts again
Papadimos says the amendments will be passed, but the Conservatives won't sign any written compromise
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty re-established in the parks, Greece continues to wrap itself in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is being enforced more by the demands of Brussels than by genuine political conviction is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October", Papadimos said when opening a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear the doubt about his stance: "We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have committed to nothing else".
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he would not approve of any letter of commitment to compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek log still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain has 'reached a leading position globally in the role of microfinance'.
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the plantea in these last two decades in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she noted is that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated the V World Micro-Credit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Objectives set by the United Nations with a horizon of 2015, and, "very especially, in one that has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people living with incomes below one dollar a day, with which it is fixed the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
It's "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Micro-Credit Summit is not only a forum for debate but also a platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
His Majesty said that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of those households will be out of poverty.
The push for the concept of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty alleviation", whose work he knew for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to observe the continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose link to this project was valued yesterday by the rating of the "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "backer of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging the audience to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this respect, he said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez said that micro-credits represent "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and that now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded to whom all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its doors contagious of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress, on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has been without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially on the agenda, but the issue was raised in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too unstrict with the Greeks and could be too strict in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were registered.
The standing ovation of several minutes won by Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Euro-fidel Finance Minister, cleared up any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor and the motion is summed up in one motto: the response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe is peaceful, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "it is time to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to 'give a face to Europe'.
In any case, that is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
It is unlikely that the 27 will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the ball's on the ground.
The delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
The Chancellor, anxious to calm the spirits within her party, has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also not tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty who are willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe is devoted to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the pass.
Recalling that two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sickness deaths
After the subsidies, the WMU and the Government are launching an offensive against the deaths from illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a fund responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the subject, which has been recurring since 2007, of combating social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany this offensive, which starts with the will to save rigorously but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on the casualties due to illness.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government intends to impose a fourth day's leave on private sector workers before they can take leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
It would also be accompanied by another measure of more symbolic scope: imposing a day of unpaid leave on officials in the event of dismissal (they are not currently without a day of leave, compared with the three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also reiterates the issue of fraud, this time aimed at the abuse of labour costs.
"Controls will be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is found committing fraud, he must refund the amounts", Xavier Bertrand warned in RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of the employment fraud.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and various policy offensives have been launched, which have normally paid off.
The French are no more sick than the rest of Europe.
Let us first of all look closely at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), over EUR 237 million in unemployment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, in 2008 subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health expenditure, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this total, 46% is related to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to sickness, amounting to 6.2 billion euros.
This is 2.5% of healthcare expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
A survey published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management company Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off because of illness.
Another study, in this case from Assurance Maladé, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave were less than 8 days, 22% were 8-14 days, 15% were 15 days to a month, 15% were 1 to 3 months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001 the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sickness is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of deaths from disease of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1,5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were 'unjustified or too long', i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties over 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of cases were considered to be 'devidely adapted or unjustified; a figure which, starting with a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132.000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 'unjustified' cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
This is certainly a small figure compared, for example, with black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9 000 and 15 000 million a year, i.e. more than the total cost of the subsidies for losses and certainly considerably more than fraud in this latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday 14 November. He also added that the hundred days given to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this objective.
"To make efforts to bring the economy back to life, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme", said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the new government's "main task", he added, as "the country's staying in the eurozone is at stake".
Accordingly, Papadémos forecasts that the country's public deficit will be reduced "up to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday expressed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said during a meeting with the deputies of his party "New Democracy".
He said he was in agreement with the deficit and debt reduction objectives, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the planned measures, said that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
The Committee calls on governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just for cancer.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is asked to do so and has been deemed competent to make the decision.
To begin with, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death".
Medicated or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And even though most Canadians wish to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, Quebec has the highest rate in this regard, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
As regards the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not match the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide by persons who were not competent or who did not give their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, who favor euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is imminent to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41 percent of respondents say that no legal action should be taken against them.
The report's authors point out that the situation regarding the maintenance or interruption of patient care is not so clear.
In addition, among their recommendations, they suggest that the penal code should state that withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, is not a criminal offence.
The committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
The Committee calls on governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just for cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee calls for it, unless it is used to reduce physical pain, to be considered euthanasia and to be subjected to the same procedures.
Other experts expressed reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signing the report "extreme", among other things because euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide", says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to prioritize personal autonomy over any other value in society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health Law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "manifesto in favour of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
The Bachar El Asad supporters demonstrated yesterday outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting it and denouncing that there is a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have spoken out in favour of President Assad's abdication.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarter of a million civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Davutoglu, also expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts with the Syrian regime have failed since the beginning of the year.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, has said that "the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime have been strengthened".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to the crackdown in Syria, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during heavy machine gun shelling and bombing in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not falter", he added, guaranteeing that "plots against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis-resolution plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities held by the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday condemned the Arab League's decision as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although it did not support the possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked markets for some time to train their team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the trade unions and the employers.
It should form a relatively small cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, a deputy from one of the many small parliamentary groups that took part in the meetings, after meeting with the appointed Council President.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a limited list, no doubt a dozen, of Ministers to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a Government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that markets will have patience and understand it".
The President's appointment initially won the favour of the markets, but then the concern was raised, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team made up primarily of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to run until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he considers.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get the confidence vote of Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that when he takes office he will work with the urgency and with the aim of ensuring that Italy "recovers its leading role" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that 'even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change'.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for new measures of rigour.
The Italian "chief of the chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will be watching the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "turning point" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editors.
The big unknown is the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some €200 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specialising in nuclear risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) draws on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and would have been involved in the manufacture of explosive synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well but who, as a Member State has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in his home country's military nuclear program".
Crime and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crime and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly over the same period, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in overall crime and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and offenses have increased again", Human Rights First said, "the increase in violence against Muslims is especially significant", the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, an official at the organization.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses", he adds, adding that such efforts could include improving police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and it's more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, causing its service to look a bit more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another called "name" allow you to more easily and live track the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow you on the Internet.
This lets you know if they're following up on messages, subscribing to new accounts, rating a message as a favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being shared to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from someone else, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi à un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable to those of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the net, users have been tweeting about the importance of this innovation with different opinions.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed", writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "golden rule" into the Constitution
The government of the great Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign credit rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers meeting, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year", said Christian-Democratic Vice-Chancellor for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State or Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The Austrian Government's approach is similar to the German model, as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce the public debt by 2020/2021 to the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
No threat of further exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchange rate if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near historic highs brought about by the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, driven by investor purchases that see it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar was again quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar, reaching levels close to those triggered by the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is hurting the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the value of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when converting them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), noted Noda, who fears the higher yen will cut short the weak recovery.
The world's third largest economy has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption from households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that no further monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by five trillion yen (€47 billion), bringing the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to 55 trillion yen (€519.000 million).
The euro area:
Guys grow, bags weaken
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to affect European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and improved growth in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European exchanges plunged a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Given the new tensions in relation to the loan yields of the most affected euro area countries, stock markets worldwide continue to yield a share of their recent gains".
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down 0.7%, renewing concerns among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to be made on a margin of small variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
The European Union has been a major player in the fight against corruption and the creation of a new political system.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds was 6.85%, while Spanish bonds on the same date offered 6.2%.
These tensions with the interest rates of the southern countries, but also of France, continue to fuel the concerns of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks choking on its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread difference between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the forecast 0,3% driven by domestic consumption.
The Commission has also taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used to finance the implementation of the common agricultural policy.
Besides, the fourth quarter is what economists are really worried about.
Germany, on the other hand, grew by 0,5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must be worth more than dogma
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed by taking short-term considerations into account or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is appropriate that an election meeting be a time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it studies the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are seven billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean doubling electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources must be addressed to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a theme that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany is therefore alone in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a replacement source, nor in Switzerland, which is solely aiming to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are moving forward with their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming construction of a power plant that was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German renewable energy model is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is against such a discourse.
The election of Berlin will mean higher electricity prices, greater energy dependence on increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and increased CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the damaging effects will be noticeable.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
The wind energy sector is a European champion, with 30% of its electricity coming from it, and it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermittency.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would deprive the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power of realism.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and in fact do not in principle oppose such energy, surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost to building an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
It is broadly export oriented and encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and capable of creating non-movable jobs.
If France decides to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of €6 billion a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is set to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no evil source.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it had no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the reactor design and some unforgivable human faults.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between the safety authorities, and French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all electricity players who want to build a power plant are studying it, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to Areva and EDF's competitors, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed "human rights country" status.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération newspaper of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France "needs no foreign talent, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is that there is a fair amount of consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, Michel Rocard set the tone by explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande merely includes trivia, stating that code-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoralally profitable, but economically it's very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists about the positive impact of immigration flows on economic growth, wages, and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
The concerns about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pushing for their wages to be cut.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly occupy jobs in unemployed sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where anesthesiologists are lacking, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in immigration flows means an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, not to mention the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to the average public budget throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this, because although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of World War II, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know from Napoleon the Little that it was a thoughtful thing.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the Greek truth-and-false referendum had a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return to the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You have to think about this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and in many cases Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organised according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a stop to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
We are not trying to take a coup, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choices and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we wouldn't know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is one which follows the orders of markets and rating agencies, one which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is being humiliated in the international arena.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and with it every one of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that the people's sovereignty regains the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless they lead to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new stalemate.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
An interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
Only by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty, can this be achieved.
To build Europe, let us make it European.
Contactless chip cards are becoming more widespread
The world's first chip card show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
Indeed, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of micro-processor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones, etc.), totalling 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart's calculations.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transportation or shopping simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the year before!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and represent about 10% of the global market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payments sector.
Approximately 26 million Visa credit cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard passes this year.
To get the upper hand, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But it is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: mobile phones.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with near field communication (NFC) technology, which is essential for transactions.
"They're falling behind".
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year".
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a trial between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer that will allow its customers to pay contactlessly via their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-held suspicions of links between the Islamic Maghreb terrorist group Al Qaeda (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algeria already "has certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating", he explained, without giving further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls pointed to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the interest of investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has been in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support from abroad and is increasingly active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourse or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of uninterested enlightened people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), is inciting the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the unholy central government.
The latter are primarily oriented towards churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuya's reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested for life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and, later, another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, particularly the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local UN headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia and Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali al-Shabab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and stated that he was willing to "share all information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think that's the case.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans are spread about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them for "manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America angered by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that means a trade war exploding, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy view, almost drowns in an attitude that "supposes" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the probes, remains unheard.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second highest-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964.
Tehran Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the US military in Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
Recourse to torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was a fan and had to loosen his piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But attacks are not easy for them.
The public is more positive about Obama's national security record, which ended bin Laden.
From Iraq, he's suspicious of military interventions that cause a sinking.
And, arguing that it takes economic rebuilding of America to resurrect its leadership, Obama seems more fair.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas into Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly with Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the opening of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have all rolled the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 and will supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third pipe along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land passage through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy sector, given that the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in making its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are large gas consumers and have increasingly limited reserves, a reality.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically", François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom's executives, many in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine pipe is made of steel coated with cement to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution", says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to step up the measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is uninterrupted throughout its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but the project managers waived it as the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to establish itself permanently at sea off their shores.
"If it breaks down, we will stop the gas flow in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have foreseen joints that are predicted to leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the status of the pipeline shall be ensured by means of an underwater robot, towed by a vessel, which carries out external inspections, as well as by means of a device circulating through the interior of the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repair.
The gas circulation is guaranteed by the pressure alone.
It's 200 bars at the beginning and 100 bars at the exit.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez (9% each) joined the group.
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom subsequently leased to the company, for a renewable period of 25 years, all gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for its full capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% with bank loans.
The total cost of the two pipes should be EUR 7.4 billion.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of the expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, up to 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit gate.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
In total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back their taste for writing.
It's got an air of adventure, hours of writing by the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took over the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And he succeeded.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12,7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the early years, in which only 3,000 booklets were designed, has been left far behind.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts businessmen, students and professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre, and has managed to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and its cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases... the brand covers a wide range of supports.
An enviable success: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Fifteenth Week for Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, compared with 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No", says Eric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made in the last 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as the average, but three times as high.
"However, there is still much to be done".
It is worth mentioning that disabled unemployed persons continue to face numerous obstacles to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years old (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed their bachelor's degree and, out of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for disabled people, compared with an average of 38%.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that 'constitute the root of the problem', says Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mindsets are moving forward, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité association noted that the directors surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, with physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from reaching the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set by a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of establishments 'subject to this contribution', as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from EUR 606 million to EUR 480 million).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a great deal of pressure on companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
As they face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens are not hiding the pleasure they have in this friendly match.
We won't dare say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his forward's anger gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national team has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for being Belgian".
"I want to move forward", replies the forward from Lille.
As for the contrast between his performances in his team and in the selection, "it's a set", has been justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to get in position".
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
Not forgetting about pleasure.
He's been cheering the Blues since he was seven, as well as during the 1998 and 2000 victorious campaigns.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This will undoubtedly strengthen the "particular" nature of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy".
In simplicity, Leekens has made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala game".
"Pride" also for proving, as "neighbour", that France "is back to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job", he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing", he stressed.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You'll see him in the next few games". Including the game against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal are looking very optimistic about the return match against Bosnia at 22:00 on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-off match, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes are over, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the Selecçao, which he has led since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-off match (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, yes, but they couldn't score the valuable goal that would have given them peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the home".
But at home, in the bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is obvious that the match "is very evenly matched", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match is very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead", the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz' successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the house", Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset to "not give them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
