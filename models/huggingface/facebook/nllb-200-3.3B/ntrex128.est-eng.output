Members of the National Assembly of Wales are afraid of looking like the Muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly have been alarmed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue has been raised by a plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Assembly.
Representatives of all political parties in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour MP said his team-mates were concerned because it rhymed with the words 'Twp' and 'Pwp'.
For those of you who don't read Welsh, the slang word for daft is 'napak' and pwp is 'poop'.
The band member said the whole group was not happy and had suggested other names.
The Welsh Conservative Party member said that his group was 'accepting' of the name change, but noted that the word 'MWP' is very similar to 'Muppet'.
For clarification, the pronunciation of the letter w in Khmer is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill on name change, said: The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are called is, of course, made by the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the National Assembly for Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the name proposals, which broadly supports the idea of renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the term of office of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the term 'Members of the Welsh Parliament' (WMPs), but in the public poll, the most popular choice was 'MWP'.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching agreement could prove a challenge for President Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill on the amendments in the coming weeks.
The reformed legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall be cast by the members themselves when the legislation is debated.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is being held to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its main neighbour represents a claim to that territory and has repeatedly objected to its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he intends to skip the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent because the churches of Harlem are in trouble.
'The oldest people I've ever spoken to have said that in the old days there was a bar on every corner and a church on every corner,' said Mr Adams.
I'm not one of them.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People communicate differently nowadays", he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people hang out every day".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and "sooner or later they will be back where they started".
Adams added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who would not donate to the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
'The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,' he added, 'who are therefore hastening the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that a large proportion of the people who live here will become members of these churches.'
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation split in the 1930's.
The black congregation, which had until then worshipped God nearby, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was occupied by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of the stores on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, when they refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's congregation planned to restore it, they put a carillon, or bell, in operation.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and steward of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's clock".
But the expert who played the carillon in the middle ages gave it another name: "cultural value" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What's been playing at St. Martin's in the last few months is a tale of architects and contractors, some of whom have been hired by the church's lay leaders, others by the bishop.
In July, the church's stewardship, or governing body, of the congregation's secular leaders, wrote to the diocese to complain that the diocese was "trying to pass on the expenses", even though the stewardship was not even involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's actions.
In California, a 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while diving for lobster.
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobster on the opening day of California's lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he was out diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries of apricots and then swam with the others to help pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, she initially thought the boy was expressing his excitement over receiving the lobster, but then realized the boy was shouting "My mind was bitten!"
I was bitten!
"His entire femur was bare", Hammel described the vision he saw when he reached the boy.
'I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"' added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Marine rescuer and captain Larry Giles told a news conference that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but were later determined to be non-threatening.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were on the upper torso.
For investigative and safety purposes, the authorities have closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas from Casablanca to Swami for 48 hours.
Giles added that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-style beauty shops, staffed by expert advisers.
As part of a major foray into the £2.7bn UK beauty market, which is still growing as fashion and home goods sales fall, wider ranges of beauty products are being trialled in 11 stores across the country, with the potential to be rolled out to other stores next year.
The reason why people invest in beauty products is because supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double its beauty product line to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in such branded areas as those currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique line of beauty products, with a majority of the products suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop is piloting a single-licence operation in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second of which will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small quantities of food every day from local food stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets are becoming more like supermarkets as the chain tries to compete with discount chains like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and more industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argo stores in hundreds of stores, and it's done the same with Habitat's stores, since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's earlier attempt to revamp its beauty and health care departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended in a dispute over how to share the profits from the sale of pharmaceuticals in their respective supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy stores three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is also playing its part in the strategy, adding luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Business Manager, said: 'We have changed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also spent money on highly trained staff who are always ready to give advice.
Our branded selection meets every need, but the attractive environment and convenient location means we are now a competitive beauty destination that can change old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left the show "in a fit of rage" when TV presenter Holly Willoughby dropped an £11 million deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's running out of time for Truly, the home furnishings and clothing brand.
A couple of businesses have compared Gwyneth Paltrow to the Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den to the wrath of Peter Jones, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "in a bad mood" when the TV star admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of her husband's business empire in Marlows, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth £1.5 million meant she no longer had enough time to devote to the home furnishings and clothing brand Truly.
The business has compared Gwyneth Paltrow to the Goop brand and thought it would double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for one of his holiday homes.
A source said that "Truly was definitely Holly's number one choice".
It was to secure her long-term future, so she thought she'd be doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the case in complete disarray.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to the launch of the production line.
There's a warehouse at Marlow headquarters full of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of the television show 'This Morning', one of Britain's highest paid celebrities, could cost the company millions of pounds, as a huge amount of money is invested in products ranging from sofa beds and pillows to clothing and homewear, and may also result in a product being withdrawn from the market.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cappi in 2016. Jones, 52, joined the brand as its first owner in March.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S branding officer and replaces Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "I don't want to comment on his business dealings".
Hard to talk about, 'cause we fell in love
Trump was joking about the criticism he received in the news for comments that some deemed "unfitting" to the president and for being overly positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his mocking news anchor voice:
I have given up nothing.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump hailed their first summit in June in Singapore as a big step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea will not see a U.S. response to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He made it clear that the US would continue to impose sanctions on the country.
Trump's encouraging tone was much more cheerful.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
There was a war brewing with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We're all good now.
He said his efforts to mend relations with Kim have paid off, including the termination of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the repatriation of the remains of American servicemen.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
"Being president is very easy, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting outside to get into this packed stadium, it's better if we have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
Unfortunately, they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international help, so things are a bit complicated,' Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to go to the Palace, it is not clear whether foreigners will be allowed to work in the area.
The National Disaster Management Agency spokesman, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palus to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although there are tsunami shelters in Achehi, they are not common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palus likely increased the number of deaths.
Travel between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge even at the best of times.
Natural disasters make it even more difficult to logistically get there.
A hospital ship stopped in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palus, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's fractured infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and has allocated money for roads and railways.
But the budget deficit threatens Mr. Joko's government, as new elections are due next year.
Mr. Yokota is also pressured by sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the predominantly Muslim community have turned to a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced in street fighting between Christian and Muslim forces using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scoring the winner in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring a brace in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team led 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it towards the far post.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq are passing the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time as possible for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I made one touch and I gave a longer blow without thinking.
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 thanks to a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before turning in midfield and passing to Liverpool.
Kovacic was a quick pass in the centerfield.
Then he made a nice air feast, leading Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard broke through the defence and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool player Alisson Becker into the back of the net.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paololo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videotons in the UEFA Euroleague on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings following a 7.5-magnitude earthquake with 18-meter-high tidal waves on Friday, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was buried beneath collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after stabbing woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with multiple stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are asking anyone in the area who may have seen or heard anything to contact them.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras may have recorded anything, to contact us as they may have information vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of the woman came to the scene, asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police say they're notifying the woman's next of kin.
A cab driver from Grayson Mews wanted to go back to his apartment, but police told him no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked to hear of the incident.
The residents were told it could take hours to get them back inside.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman at the scene, crying.
He kept saying, "That's awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police buses were still in the closed area, and a third was just outside.
A number of police officers stood in the area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using the 30 September log 247 keyword.
The statue of Cromwell is the last monument to be erected, and it is the cause of the 'rewrite of history' controversy.
To remove it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects by the man's inhuman vigilante followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as stupid and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the French discussion of the removal of the statues, it was impossible to leave the monument in front of Oliver Cromwell's Palace of Westminster untouched.
Cromwell did not plunder the pictures in the English Civil War, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the false Cromwell man was sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycrofts brilliant Cromwell presentation is a testament to the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a person whom many people still feel should be honoured.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people in the late 19th century, rather than today, saw the Cromwellian Parliament as a protector from outside pressure, and in this case, of course, from the power of the King.
Whether this is an accurate representation is a matter of endless historical debate.
What is certain is that the turmoil of the mid-17th century has shaped the future of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.
Chinese farmer killed by a butcher
Local media reports that a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked by a pig that killed a man.
A man identified only by the surname Yuan was found dead with a bruised artery and covered in blood near the seaside of Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On 30 May 2005 a pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in his barn in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had allegedly come with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the man's cousin found him dead and discovered that the side door had been opened.
He said there was a big, bloody valley with a mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 249.47-kilogram stallion had reportedly stunned the farmer to death.
"My cousin's feet were all bloodied and crushed", the Guiyang Evening News quoted the victim's cousin Wu as saying.
Security camera recordings showed Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are reportedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, pigs have been observed attacking humans before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their Massachusetts farm, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 1,100 pounds (294.83 kg) had nailed a Welsh farmer's tractor until the man's wife chased the animal away.
In 2012, after an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs do not normally attack, but the taste of blood can make their heads go crazy.
They're just playful.
They are very curious troublemakers who have no intention of hurting anyone.
"You just have to respect them enough", the man said.
After-thoughts of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves over the northern coast of Mexico into cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 05:00 Eastern Standard Time on Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, located 400 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will continue north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure system is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will reach Mexico, where up to 10 inches of rain will fall.
Then, tropical humidity reacts with the approaching low pressure to produce extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest of the country over the next few days.
Rainfall of between one and three inches [2.54 cm] and four inches [10.16 cm] in some places will cause dangerous flash floods, flood waters, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall of five to about seven and a half centimeters an hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of between two and three inches (5.08 and 10.16 cm) is also expected in certain areas of the southern United States, especially Arizona.
Flash floods are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Certainly, if there is a danger of tropical rain locusts, you should not go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into swift-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are accompanied by occasional gusty winds and flying dust.
The approaching low tide will bring with it heavy rains in some places along the Southern California coast.
Rainfall totals of over 1.27 cm are possible, and may cause minor flooding and mudslides.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
A scattered pattern of tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, with showers becoming extensive Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and will remain until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations in the United States are forecast, caused by the cooling of the Arctic, while temperatures in tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this causes large temperature changes in small areas.
The weather on Sunday in the central United States is a great example of significant temperature variations.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, run as high as 80 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
The next few days, the long summer heat will try to gather itself again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm October with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to the northeast of the country in the mid-80s.
In New York, the forecast for Tuesday is 26.6 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that the eastern United States is likely to experience high average temperatures during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by over 20 million people
Over 20 million people watched on Thursday, six television channels, the gripping confessions of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who allegedly sexually assaulted him in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political gridlock continued as broadcasters cut off regular airings of Friday's show to cover last-minute twists: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake contracted with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed his drunken head and tried to rip off his wife's clothes at her high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that it didn't happen.
The Nielsen report estimated that more than 20.4 million people likely watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who watch the broadcasts in the public authorities.
By comparison, this is about the same size audience as that of a football final or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the daylong session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
Interest continued to grow after the trial.
Flake was the central character in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office filed a statement saying it voted for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man Friday morning being held up by a mob as he tried to take an elevator to a justice committee hearing.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes down when he was accused and it was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
 Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
She was told, "You have power, while so many women are completely powerless".
Flake said his department issued a statement, adding before the elevator closed that he had more to say at the Judiciary Committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks broadcast the live broadcast several hours after the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate floor for a vote.
But Flake said he's only doing it on the understanding that the FBI will be investigating the charges against the candidate next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was persuaded in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After further discussion with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a bearing, because it was clear that the Republicans couldn't get Kavanaugh's vote without the confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of playing politics
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who are speculating about his plans to leave the European Union of 'playing politics' with the future of Britain and damaging the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another newspaper interview, headlined by Theresa May with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pushed his attack on May's so-called Brexit blueprint, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely brainless".
Police have arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a man suspected in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and booked on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police adding that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer said that the man's bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, the Louisiana State Police Criminal Science Lab, Southern University Police, and the people in the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement agencies for their "delicate and just" approach.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6'2" man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
His last season averages were 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team is "shocked and devastated" by Wayde's death.
"It's something you worry about all the time", Wade said.
A volcano erupts ash on Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano because of the resumption of activity in the crater, which resulted in 183 gas leaks and ash explosions in 24 hours.
The Centre has been monitoring a series of thunderstorms and tremors.
Images shared on social media showed the front windows of the car covered in ashes in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted an increase in activity at the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of independence day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands joined the counter-protests to celebrate Catalonia's vote against secession.
A group of masked pro-secession fighters, held back by riot police, attacked the last ones with eggs and gunpowder, creating thick dust clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Riots also occurred later, when the police had to use knives to control fights.
For hours, supporters of independence chanting "No Forget, No Forgiveness" were met by pro-unity protesters shouting "Long live Spain!"
According to local press reports, 14 people who were slightly injured in the demonstration received medical attention.
Tensions are still high in the pro-independence region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but Catalans who support secession have nonetheless celebrated it.
Voters overwhelmingly decided in favour of independence, although turnout was low, as those against withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to block a vote in front of polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Supporters of independence had been camping outside the polling stations Friday night to avoid demonstrations in support of the state police.
The riots did happen, but they had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a pro-secession rally with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent state.
Last year was one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying over the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck", she said.
Despite a significant but small victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have had a tough time maintaining momentum this year, with a number of prominent leaders either exiled themselves or detained and awaiting trial for their part in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Mechanic Joan Puig, 42, who is recording a demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the riot was being fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been under house arrest since last year, announced that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
Candidating to the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressure of the Spanish government,he said.
Londonderry: man arrested after car crashes into home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39... were arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building.
Also, the car could have been shot at with an arrow at some point.
The blow of the pen gives Livingstone a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was the winning goal.
The exalted Livingston has taken Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to their second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot was the deciding factor as Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian by a second.
Gerrard is unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroleague.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his undefeated streak to seven games, while head coach Holt still had a taste of defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing a chance against the Nyres visitors.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored, as their direct style of play was causing the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defence, but his efforts were exhausted at the gate, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to hit Craig Halkett's head kick over the goal.
The hosts have been very quiet about letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they might cause problems for the visitors in certain areas.
And that's the way the shot is dealt.
Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston had a chance to play a scheme in which Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and managed to get it from the middle of the penalty area.
By then, the Rangers were mostly in possession of the ball, but were unable to break through the defence, which is why goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side were mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal once.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor blocked a shot from Scott Pittman and Lithgow shone brightly in Livingston's next team effort.
The punches consistently made their way into and out of the Livingston penalty area, and two penalties were also taken, one for Halkett's attempt to substitute Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
A phenomenal achievement by Livingston 
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Every player was great, going above and beyond the line moving up the ladder completely beyond expectations.
Their style of play and players have changed little since their return to the top flight, but Holt has to be commended for the way he's been tempering the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, putting together a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralli on their backs throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked the spirit.
Despite their intermediate level of excellence under Gerrard, it was lacking in the examples here.
Their last possession proved to be a failure: the home run was just a one-off that could serve as a wake-up call to Rangers in the middle of the table.
The controversial reception of Erdogan in Cologne
In Berlin, on Saturday, September 29, there was both laughter and concern as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out of the loop on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new, gigantic mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police cited security concerns, banning the 25,000-strong crowd from the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them deaf, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to host the Turkish president in their country.
The fighting demonstrators show a split in attitudes toward the visitor: Some Turks living in Germany hail him as a hero, while others despise the man as an autocrat.
Road accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed after being hit by car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived to provide assistance, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision two kilometers from the Saturday crash site on Childers Street, where a hit-and-run driver fled the scene.
London police said authorities are working to identify the man and notify his family.
Traffic has been closed at the scene and buses have been diverted. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials were injured in the riots
The prison authorities announced that six prison officers were injured in the riots at the high-security men's prison.
A riot broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartine Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30am British Summer Time and has not yet ended.
The riot police, with expertise in the area, have been deployed to deal with the riots that have concentrated in one wing and involve eight inmates.
The prison officials were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialised prison staff have been called to deal with the ongoing case at HMP Long Lartini Prison.
Five crew members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was taken to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
But last October, riot police were called to the prison to quell a serious disturbance in which prison officials were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash floods (for low-lying areas, the hurricane may be beneficial)
Tropical depression doesn't hit Arizona very often, but it's likely to do so early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert of the southwestern United States, bringing with it the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set up flash flood watch services for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area with heavy rain showers on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service reported that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within a 200-mile [320.8 km] radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed within 40 miles (64.37 km) of the Arizona border.
The most recent National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall of between five and ten and sixteen inches, which can reach up to six inches in the areas surrounding the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other eastern desert areas of the United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, precipitation is likely to be between 2.54 and 5.08 centimeters, with limited areas reaching up to 10.16 centimeters.
The sudden rainfall on fertile areas can be a blessing, as the region suffers from the plague.
While floods are a cause for great concern, such rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since drought is common in South America.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme, Category 2 drought, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa is crossing the Baja California peninsula into Mexico.
Rosa, which was still at hurricane level Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 4 miles per hour, is now 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is exposed to the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean and is therefore subducting slightly.
So Rosa is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The amount of rainfall in certain areas of Mexico may be high, resulting in a significant flood risk.
From Baja California to northwest Sonora, rainfall of between 7.62 and 15.24 centimeters, with occasional rainfall of up to 25.4 centimeters, is expected, reported weather.com.
Rosa then heads northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, moving over Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday afternoon.
"The main threat following Rosa or its aftermath is very strong showers in Baja California, the west of Sonora and the deserts of the southwestern United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These storms can cause life-threatening flash floods and floodwaters in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found with a disability in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 0400 British Standard Time.
The victim was taken to a hospital in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking anyone with a cell phone recording of the incident to contact them.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "being swept away by the Democratic Party's anger and hatred".
"Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said in his cheer speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was under the scrutiny and the hatred of the Democratic Party" during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and sensitively refuting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who said the man assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said Saturday that "America saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day".
"The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most respected jurists of our time with a background of impeccable public service", he told the West Virginia crowd.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, while also talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the midterm elections.
Five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not running, but I'm running, he said.
That's why I'm everywhere, to fight for the great candidates.
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission to "stand up and be counted".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected no later than Friday, a senior aide to Republican leaders told CNN.
Thousands killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed and many more were swept away as giant waves washed ashore after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when six-foot waves swept across the beach, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach doing their jobs, not fleeing immediately, and thus remaining victims, said BNPB spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it took cars, wages and houses with it, wiping everything off the face of the earth", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving over the open sea at 500 miles per hour before it made landfall.
Some people climbed into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 center.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Agency showed destroyed buildings and shops, destroyed and collapsed bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
The aftershocks in the coastal town continued Saturday.
The quake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Bureau (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than that of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on a long and narrow bay, may have increased the tsunami's force, the BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater than the one in the coastal area of Donggala, 300 kilometers north of Pal, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The messages from Donggala "are completely lacking and contain no information", Nugroho said.
"The region has a population of over 300,000", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, and it could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to notify the tsunami in the city of Palu, even though officials said the waves hit the beach at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building warning people panically moving down the street of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, a wall of water washes ashore, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to confirm the authenticity of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that disrupted communications in the Palu area and made it difficult for authorities to organize rescue operations.
The military has begun sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities to help, officials said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue operations, remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, sheltered by the gift tents erected in the courtyard of their office, they saw crumbling images on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
This is very bad.
Although the aid forces began their disaster relief efforts vigorously, some complained that staff from foreign aid agencies with extensive experience were prevented from travelling to Palos.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and reinforcements can only be sent from abroad if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
It's never happened before.
It is still a disaster at the provincial level,said Aulia Aryani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government says, Okay, this is a national disaster, we can start accepting international aid, but no such status has been declared yet.
When the second night of prayer arrived after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing were still full of hope that their loved ones would be among those miraculous events that would ease the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped in rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesia's national figure skating coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing figure skating players for the Asian Games held in Indonesia earlier this month.
The others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior ice skater, I have a personal burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon was talking about how after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the skyscraper community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors at the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means the messages didn't get through", he said.
The thieves took $23,585.88 from an ATM in Newport on the Lewes.
On Friday morning, thieves stole €23 585.88 from an employee of Brinck, who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levees, the Newport Police station said in a press release.
A driver emptied an ATM at an amusement park and was preparing to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the man was at it, another man chased after the Brinks employee and stole a purse full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, writes a press release, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves is asked to contact Newport Police on the telephone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper is going by his new name, Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, a man tweeted about the change: "Former Kanye West".
41-year-old West has been nicknamed "Ye" for some time, and he even used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to announce his new album Yandhi.
He's replacing singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her concert during "The Hours", the show's writer said.
In addition to being a shortened form of his current first name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is one of the most used words in the Bible, which means 'this is it,'" West said earlier, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, these are we.
I changed my name from Kany, which means "the one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our mess and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye West is not the only rapper who's playing with his name.
Sean Combs is known primarily by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, has also used his name with and without the hyphen, in both upper and lower case.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks against students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Sunday in the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to control the Mexicans.
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people as left-wing student movements across Latin America were being held in check.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly stipends to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double its research funding in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee, a funder and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made following statements by various parts of the US government on AI, although the US has no formal AI strategy in general.
At the same time, China announced last year its plan to be a leader in the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, considering that other countries are so far behind the US and we are working towards the next AI breakthrough, said Lee.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the best American Othello player.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
US researchers have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"China is not taking over the educators, it's taking over the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. support its artificial intelligence efforts.
I think that people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to scientists in the US, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from both industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it had started funding the $2 million initiative AI Next.
But the National Science Foundation currently funds over $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at creating a national AI security committee has not been amended.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to that territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on a new name for Macedonia, but opponents of the name claim that the name would undermine the national identity of the Slav majority Macedonian people.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he had no intention of participating in the referendum, and the campaign of disregard has raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the 50% required to win the referendum.
The referendum will ask: "Do you support Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the states created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to secure its accession to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the Macedonian youth to be able to live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change the name.
The National Election Commission said that as of 1:00 p.m., there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballot.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the Macedonian capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in Strumica in the Macedonian referendum on the change of the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament building, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage, raising tents in front of the seats for those who would not vote.
'We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join head on, not through the door of the servants,' said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and get Europe out of the Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I think that the vast majority will support the name change, as over 80 per cent of citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership,said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that the "yes" word would be the "yes" of our future.
The results of the poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research revealed that 30 to 43 percent of voters are planning to take part in the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
A poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would answer "Yes".
The success rate for the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The defeat of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the government's Western policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch Manchester City player Sergio Aguero go for the goal against Brighton.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence to give Manchester City a 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like his 65th-minute goal came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine striker has crossed the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before he got into the open.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players at the Brighton penalty area.
Then he hit the ball to the left of him, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first stroke to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a stroke to the right of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his legs", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We said he'd play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky the initial lead in the Premier League toss.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly on Brighton's turf.
He sent the ball out of the air nicely to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane got the ball to hit a few times before he drove Sterling away.
The Sky Blues kicked the ball over the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the cheerleader against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was little reason to start over.
And Scherzer, a fighting man, hopes to take down the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game, have any hope of making it to the finals.
The Rockies are guaranteed at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure its first division spot.
But even if we're not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in the air with this crowd and another team in Denver is probably on a higher level than any other game I can expect to play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to race here?
The Nationals have yet to name a player for Sunday's opener, but they're reportedly leaning toward Scherzer's feed in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be his 34th bowl, did a warm-up on Thursday and would eat as usual on Sunday.
This right-handed Washington player leads the team with an 18-7 record, his ERA is 2.53, his strikeout count is 300 and his save percentage is 220 2/3 this season.
Trump giving a pep talk in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while at the same time speaking of the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"This is a big event, and I'm not running, but I'm running, so I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates", she said.
Trump continued: "You're seeing this horrible, extremely horrible, extreme group of Democrats.
And they've decided to take back power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and their dirty tricks.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to ride over for power and control, all they want is power and control over everything, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he says, are on a mission to "stand up and stop the fight".
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "vicious, vicious, unprincipled and false".
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was booed off in the audience.
Remember what he said?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, that was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a big union.
It's intolerable to those who express their opinion
When the activists in my local party, Momentum, voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I'm the last Labour MP on the list to be told you're not welcome, and all for expressing my opinion.
My colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, was subjected to the same treatment for her strong anti-Semitic stance.
In my case, the judges judged me for not going with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European affairs, which are all strangely similar issues on which Jeremy had disagreements with previous leaders.
The Labour Party of Nottingham East said in a statement that 'we want our meetings to be inclusive and creative'.
For the most part, my eight-year experience as a local Labour MP with Friday night meetings is exactly that.
Unfortunately, as things stand today, this is not the case for most meetings, and the promise of being 'more open and generous' in politics has long since been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed to see who is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started right after Jeremy became leader, a colleague with whom I thought I shared similar political views before, now expected me to change my mind and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed to, whether it was on national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I go out in public, no matter what I'm actually saying, it's followed by condemnation on social media, urging me to step down, ignoring party politics and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and determination of those fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy area is how abusive levels have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer such a large community and every initiative of non-alignment or change in the electoral rules will make the party smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and then I'd be fine.
But that's not what I came to politics for.
From the moment I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government which had left my great school's classroom literally on the verge of collapse, I have sought to speak out for better public services to those who need them most, acting both as a local councillor and a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political views or areas of disagreement with local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I want to say that as the country moves towards Brexit, which will hurt our homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my supporters, whether they're in the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 3817 Melrose: undefeated Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have tilted the final score somewhat, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully entertaining first Tenente league game.
They're now the only undefeated team in the top ten of the table.
In the end, it was the team's high-level defense and better risk-taking that brought home the victory, and coach Peter Murchiel has every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested all the time during the games and we're still undefeated, so of course I'm happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The story of the Ayres, they used their opportunities better than we did".
A try by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayre the lead, but a yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was given up by the Warriors for the game, gave Melrose a chance, with Jason Baggot making a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayri's lead with a penalty just before the end of the half, finishing the single-game standings at the end of the half in 175 in Ayri's favour.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was overtaken by Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
A long delay followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was carried off by a carriage. As the game continued, Ayr further increased his lead thanks to a try by Stafford McDowall, who was passed by Climo.
Ayre's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, but again paid for the failed passing of Melrose's Bruce Colvin after heavy pressure.
The home team, however, gathered strength again and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for obstructing Climo without the ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball down behind the advancing Ayres.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box and sent flanker Gregor Henry off in the fifth inning of the home team game.
The star of Still Game wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears poised to enter the hospitality business after it was discovered that he had been named CEO of a well-known restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the acclaimed BBC TV series, which he writes and stars in with long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is making new plans for life after Craiglange.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source at Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was looking to break into the restaurant business in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours" Bolivia without borders hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific again
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean-going flags flying over the administration buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto of the naval bases is: "The sea is our right".
It is our duty to restore it.
In a landlocked country, the memory of the coastline lost in the bloody conflict over resources in Chile in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia is in a state of crisis, a spirit of unity and peace, and the country is naturally expecting a positive outcome,said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Scores of Bolivians across the country are watching the international court ruling on big screens, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia, after which Chile, after decades of disruptive negotiations, will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia to give the latter an independent access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is at a high risk with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court will probably not vote in Bolivia's favor, or if it does, little will change.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to cede Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court's decision is being handed down only six months after the final statements were heard suggests that this was not an 'unusual case', said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And apart from the additional causes in Bolivia, the last four years may have made things worse.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian authorities,said Zárate.
The moral warfare of the beauties has lost all the goodwill of the rest of Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, it's going to be extremely difficult to discuss.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily hasty.
Monday gives Bolivia a unique opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile and to "end 139 years of divisions with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's best-known presidents, uses the maritime issue to express political anger.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,he added.
The decision is a chance to see that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea said it would not disarm until it could trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never be the first to give up their nuclear weapons unless Washington can be trusted.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made to each other by the rival leaders at the Singapore summit.
He comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy in limbo more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said the airstrikes were a result of the U.S. belief that continued sanctions and refusal to end the war with Korea would force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is cautious about making such a statement unless Pyongyang takes the first significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the weapons it sees as the only possible way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion trends in Paris bring the viewer a series of massive headbands, which are brought to shoppers in the shopping streets of their neighborhood.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the stage in their 2019 summer season a series of bizarre oversized headwear that dazzled the fashion world in Paris.
High-top, impractical hats are in fashion this summer on Instagram, and these designers have sent their foot-dragging creations to fashionistas.
Valentino's signature piece was a beige over-dressed hat that covered the models' heads, decorated with a wide brim that resembled a hat.
Other large items of clothing included jewelled earrings, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they were not intended to keep the head warm.
Also, Thom Browne showed off a strange selection of masks, doing so just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had a mouth that was curled up, so they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One part of the creation resembled a diving suit with a windpipe and goggles, while the other resembled a melted ice-cream.
And if you keep up those giant fashion flights, you'll be in luck.
Mourning people predict that the giant cat may be making its way to the shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats come right off the cover of La Bomba, which is a 60-centimeter-wide-rimmed lapel hat that's been seen on the heads of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult brand that has created a highly impractical hat, posted on social media, sent fashion designers another big piece of work - a shoulder-length bracelet that is almost as big as the bikini model wearing it.
The orange raffichette with a white leather strap and a raffichette neckline was the highlight of the 2019 summer collection of Jacquemeuse La Riviera in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and handbags on the shopping streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are important for global citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence rankings, and this continued in 2018 with the following outstanding examination results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
These schools, with a total of over 30 000 students across Scotland, and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for their chosen profession, and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a context-specific curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a well-known and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head".
If you speak to him in his native language, it reaches his heart.
And it's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
And this year's fresh exam results show that the languages with the highest pass rates among private schools are at the top of the charts.
In all, 68 percent of students who took a foreign language course received a high grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students achieved A's in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as a vital skill which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, which are now among the subjects of choice, are included in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that among the reasons why employers have difficulty finding workers for vacancies, 17% of respondents identified a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in preparing young people for their future jobs.
As more and more jobs require language skills, this is becoming a necessity in an increasingly globalized world.
Whatever career paths one has chosen, learning a second language is a real advantage for the future, as it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with citizens of foreign countries gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French the only language with a two-person percentage at 15%.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially in developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in every school.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages considered to be the most important in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interests, private schools always have the possibility to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing an environment of learning that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It can no longer be denied that in a globalising business environment, languages are crucial to the future of the country, and therefore education must reflect this.
Modern languages should indeed be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots a choice, a diversity and a magnificence.
I'll have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
Eager fans will no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But his minutes are still to be determined.
"It's over one and under 48, " Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After last week's practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to warm me up at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump campaign event in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off his campaign series of events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump campaign events planned for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote looms as Trump chooses who to nominate for the vacant Supreme Court seat, he is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's campaign rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can I watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place this Saturday night, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. eastern coast time.
The Trump campaign's West Virginia event can be streamed online through YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, who has been under intense scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate vote on the bill has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the matter.
But the main purpose of the series of campaign events is to help re-energize Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
So President Trump's campaign manager said that the purpose of these five events next week is to mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
"Controlling Congress is so important to the president's agenda that Trump will be going on a fast-track campaign season, diving into as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring backers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday marks the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to cheer him on for his performance", said West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haeder, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The USA team is nervous for the competition, keeping their hopes high for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the games on Saturday afternoon may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
A moving pivotal pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the tipping point is now?
"They led by six points, which has now become four, so I think I can consider this a small turning point", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, that's clear, as they lead by four points and there are 12 points left.
Spieth says the Americans feel they don't have enough wind in their sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially from Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been a foot soldier on both sides of the fence and the green and sets an example.
Those victory cries from his throat grew louder with each round, overshadowing the decisive booth that would have led to the fourth match five seconds after he and Thomas were down by two.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar cry, which showed his belief that the Americans are not yet out of the competition.
"You just have to focus more and worry about your game", Spieth said.
It's the only thing the players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players to have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's odd but loving couple is four of a kind and nothing can go wrong.
Mollywood was the only pair not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and returning at nine on Friday morning.
This game, and the way their energy flows both into the noisy crowd and back again, reinforces the notion that the players they will be competing against on Sunday, and that when the sun sets on Le Golf National, there is no player more prominent to confirm a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferred both to different holes at the same time.
But the talk of European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of this morning, when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine, digging a Spaniard and a Swede into a hole so deep they had no hope of digging themselves out.
And on Saturday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and doubles are extremely engaging to watch closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give to each other, the advice they don't get, and the way that can change in an instant.
Europe has been playing better as a team and has taken the lead with a strong lead for the final day, but this four-way session showed that the US team has the nerve to fight, something that some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe is leading 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take a strong lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, taking a 10-6 lead over the United States after Saturday's four-ball and pairings.
The great duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their previous record at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who had been instrumental in preserving the cup they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, after a disastrous defeat, dominated the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. put up more of a fight in the doubles, winning two games, but they were unable to make up the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 singles on Sunday to retain the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight, and along with Molinari, who is nicknamed Molliwood after the weekend, they are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four straight in their fourth Ryder Cup match.
Having destroyed the four-ball of Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau even more decisively: 5-4.
Woods, who had been dragging himself through two games on Saturday, showed a casual glow, but has now lost 29 of his four-ball and doubles games, 19 of them, resulting in seven straight losses.
Justin Rose, who had been out for four balls this morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to tie Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third in the world, 2-1 in the match.
In Europe, it was unsuccessful, although the competition was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the Americans to the two-point line on Saturday.
They won the four-ball tie 2-1 over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning the doubles match between Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3, having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to go into the singles, even though as owners, Furyck's side need only a win to keep the cup.
Although they are two days ahead of the runners-up, after Sunday's counter-attack, it seems they will not succeed.
North Korea says that under no circumstances will they disarm themselves unilaterally due to a lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened their mistrust of the United States and that the country has no plans to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual meeting that North Korea had taken 'remarkable goodwill actions' over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear test site and pledging to abolish nuclear weapons and not to spread nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the US responding to it", he said.
Without trust in the United States, our country has no security, and in these circumstances, we are in no way prepared to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's opposition to a 'step-by-step' approach to denuclearisation, under which North Korea is rewarded if it takes step-by-step steps, it was important in his statement that he did not reject the unilateral disarmament that Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to move towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has been calling for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the stringent international restrictions on North Korea.
The US is the first to demand the abandonment of nuclear weapons and is stepping up the pressure of restrictions to achieve their goal by force, even as it opposes the declaration of the end of the war,said Ri.
I think that limitations that bring us to our knees is a dream for people who don't know us at all.
But the problem is that continuing to restrict ourselves only makes us more distrustful.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If South Korea, not the US, had been one of the parties to the nuclear disarmament issue, the Korean peninsula nuclear disarmament issue would not have reached this deadlock".
However, Ri's speech was a sharp departure from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's deployment of missiles toward the US mainland was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a "missile man" in a suicide mission.
This year, Trump praised Kim, who last year threatened to totally destroy North Korea, at the UN for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for doing so, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's enforcement of the restrictions must continue vigorously and unabated until we can fully and definitively confirm the denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in an effort to prevent Pyongyang from funding its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met in Riga on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip didn't go over well.
After meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him within hours for "gangster-like" demands.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missiles and nuclear complex if the United States took "responsive action".
He said Kim had told him that under the "responsible measures" he meant the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students are required to sleep more to combat a growing culture of aggressive learning through caffeinated, all-night study marathons.
Students who love academics at the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of taking care of yourself.
According to the course's designer, Dr. Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School doctor and a professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, it is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to create the course after giving a talk on how sleep disorders affect learning.
 At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said,  Why am I only being told about this now, in my last year of school?
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it made me mad, he explained to the Telegraph.
The course, which was added to the curriculum this year for the first time, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health, said that the university decided to take the course into its curriculum after finding that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the work week.
The one-hour course includes a number of tasks of opposite nature.
One section shows a picture of a community setting where students can click on coffee cups, blinds, sneakers and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of a well-formed sleep routine.
The second part of the study will explain to participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the university campus with its counter-signature symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this does not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,' added Professor Czeisler.
He said there is still a sense of pride in night-time study marathons, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be a student's safe weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added. It even helps to combat weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, making you constantly hungry. 
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course by attending one of his classes the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to help create an extracurricular course.
As a next step, it would like all postgraduate students to undergo a similar programme of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set their alarm clock for both bedtime and wake-up time, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lighting, as it can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, the goal from the pitching mound, defeated Gerrard's men.
The Rangers suffered another poor away game as Dolly Menga's shot from Steven Gerrard's side led to a 1-0 win over Livingston.
Ibrox were hoping to claim their first away win since February, when they beat St Johnstone 4-1, but Gary Holt's side caused only Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, trailing by eight points to Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored his goal with seven minutes to go in the half and the Rangers ' poor preparation never recovered from it .
So Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, trailing Hibernian by one goal.
The Rangers may not be out of the woods yet, as their forward Calum Spence needed treatment for a head wound after being struck by what appears to be a thrown object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that took Ayr and Betfred to the semi-final of the Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, went on to take the same 11 points from Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with his well-trained boys smothering their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have been the dominant force in town, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored in the second minute of the game when Menga's first change sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder didn't take his chance.
A deep free-kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett next, but its defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-armed shot at the back post.
The Rangers were in control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt certain that he should have been given a penalty kick when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, after the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Columbia player's complaint.
The Rangers managed to score just two hits in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly is not worried about the Lassana Coulibaly header or the Ovie Ejaria incident.
While the 34th minute Livi's performance may have broken the rules, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't contain Jacobs' deep-dive performance.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and selected Menga, who simply carried the plan to completion.
Gerrard acted in the break, trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and that trade almost paid off when the winger tore Morelo, but the impressive Kelly was able to block his shot.
But Livingston continued to entertain the guests by playing exactly the kind of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have advanced to the end, but McGregor stood firm, holding up Jacobs before Lithgow hit him with a big arc.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again requested a penalty when he went to the top with Jacobs, which Thomson again failed to satisfy.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and on the LOENADES ... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
From this scientific pioneer, the Geiger counter also became a pop-culture staple, as in the 1950 film "The Clocks of the Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When these earpieces are worn, the sound of atoms released by the radioactivity of minerals can be heard.
I'm not sure it's going to work.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the cheat cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'spy' on rogue cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the rogue cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying those cells in a laboratory
They then detect a protein common to many cancers and are injected back into the body.
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman, who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells, lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to make them ' look like ' the protein that is found in different types of HER2 cancer, and then injecting these cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of many types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, where immune cells are taken from patients and taught to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West started the Trump supporting tribe by wearing a MAGA hat on SNL live.
That didn't go very well.
A dismissive chorus of fans responded to Kanye West's performance on Saturday Night Live after his wildly-worded speech praising US President Donald Trump and announcing his candidacy for the same office in 2020.
After that night, he performed his third song, "Ghost Town", wearing a hat with the words "Make America Great", and he began to rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've talked to so many white people who have asked me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
"If I was so worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the set with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the episode didn't air, the West's noisy scenes were uploaded to comedian Chris Rock's social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to taunt West with the mail.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes with his hat.
They made fun of me backstage.
They said I shouldn't go in there with my hat on.
They were fucking with me!
And then they say I'm in a drowned place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the place that drowned? I'm going to put on my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.
His comments angered viewers on at least two occasions and seemed to embarrass the SNL team, with one person, according to Variety, saying, "The entire studio was silenced to death".
West was brought on at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many with the song "I Love It", during which he appeared as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one brave soul, we thank you for your courage in fighting the mob".
But the host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful".
But I decided to NOT honor (by playing my music or my clothes or by supporting his "art" anyone who I think believes in and spreads a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us, he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now the real Kanye West.
He is not the first singer to change his stage name, following the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has been known as Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, who has made his name a symbol.
The attempted murder charge in the stabbing at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is not in favor of the masculine side of the celebrity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress brushes aside the stereotype of the aggressive hero, saying that such roles on screen mean young boys often feel they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought something had gone wrong and raised the question of how to tackle the issue of male masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones cousin Rose Leslie (31), admitted that he felt strongly that this problem needed attention.
"I feel very strongly, personally, that we've gone wrong with masculinity", he said.
What have we taught men as they grow up, in relation to the problem we see now?
Kit believes that the rise of the masculine in the kiwi is partly the fault of television, because it shows the most despicable characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets gives young boys the feeling that they must be just like that if they are to be men.
I think this is really one of the great questions of our time: how do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong for the young men.
In the interview, he also confessed that he would never participate in any Game of Thrones sequences the following summer after the series ended, saying that he was "in love with his battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be participating in Sam Shepard's revival of True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Roseanne to be the best thing about Game of Thrones.
"I was in this show with my wife, so it gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character, the beloved of Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has jumped to 14%.
Health officials estimate that more than 820,000 people are afflicted with this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases are from sex, so changing the past.
Originally , HIV was spread in parts of China through infected blood transfusions .
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly high.
Because of the country's old-fashioned values, studies show that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many disease transmissions are related to the inadequate sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed the use of universal access to HIV medication to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP senator's employee leaked the data, saying it was "dangerously false" and "water-drain theory".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are being spread by "ultra-right" trolls and their websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and provided membership information for employees under Waters, Hill reported.
This unfounded allegation is completely and utterly false, Waters continued.
 My employees whose identity, personal data and safety are endangered by these fraudulent and false statements are not in any way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded allegation is a complete and irrefutable lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is born of anger", Fleischer wrote.
It suggests that he has a history of violence, which is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't get mad.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the prosecutor's motives.
They must remain calm.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It was important, when it came to the truth", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the relevant agencies and law enforcement agencies" about these fraudulent allegations.
We will do everything to find the perpetrators, she continued, and to hold them legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all my employees.
The film Johnny English Strikes Again review - underrated spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's now common to look for the meaning of Brexit in all new British films, and it seems particularly apt in the Johnny English parody series of comedy parodies, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was followed in 2011 by a revival of Johnny English Reborn.
Is it humorous to joke about how obviously stupid we are in our new export option for the country?
In any case, the unqualified Johnny English with the red-eye has been given permission to do things again in his cunning way - and that this broad comic creation is intended for non-English speaking film territories.
Of course, this is an undercover agent who, despite his strangely pretentious smoothie-glamour, is a bit like Clouseau, a bit like Mr. Bean, and a bit like the character who set the tone for the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It's also based on the character of the traveler and international mystery Atkinson, once played in a forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, who leaves behind nothing but chaos.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last J.E. movie.
I liked the way Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval iron suit and the helicopter wings clicking against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when serious spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer self-assured comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than for adults, and for me, the shrewd adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent films of Bean.
Now, the ever-present assumption is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has broken into the UK's top-secret spy network, exposing the identities of every secret police officer in the UK, much to the dismay of the local agent, Kevin Eldon, who has a regrettably small role.
It's the final straw for the prime minister, who is a party-going, troubled character who suffers under the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character thing brilliantly, but there's not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisors suggest that since all active spies are in danger, he should recall someone who's retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster at a prestigious institution, teaching secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers the School of Rock-type spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his longtime partner, Bug, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously squandered.
So, Batman and Robin, the scandals of His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, as they meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously prey to a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve all of Britain's computer problems, the hapless Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their whimsical odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly boarding the Volta luxury yacht; and English sets off a veritable mayhem as he attempts to use the virtual reality headset to access the interior of the Volta house.
There are no brakes in this last section, but as cute and edgy as it is, the whole thing has a kid's TV mic on it.
It's a pretty mediocre piece of shit.
And as with other Johnny English films, I was wondering, is there really no place in the British film industry for Rowan Atkinson to be given a role that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has a plan where British people work four days a week but are paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has been considering a revolutionary plan that would see the British working four days a week, but being paid for five.
The party wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to employees by giving them one extra day off.
So the workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and is intended to tilt the state in favor of workers.
The four-day work week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress to allow workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: 'The review of the Bill is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an effort that is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day week during their 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party will not discuss it".
Vice Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to clarify his vision of a socialist reverse economy.
McDonnell said he's determined to take power back from the "dirty" corporate executives and "profit-seekers".
The Vice-Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the web companies may not get their full stake back because the Labour Party could 'take a stand' on the perceived wrongdoing.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and to create participating equity funds to give 10% of the equity of private companies to employees instead of giving annual bonuses of up to EUR 561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nominee for at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could affect the end of Republican support for senators.
In Sunday's poll, "60 Minutes" co-host Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I said I'd go to the hearing, I said I'd talk to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were brought and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, decisive, and unambiguous.
Graham's voice seems rock solid.
"I am very confident in my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and the only way to change that is to bomb him", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I do know that Brett denied it forcefully", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one he's named has been able to confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, the annual New York Global Citizen Festival is a musical event with a huge celebrity presence and an equally impressive goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people gather in Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy the likes of singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by continuously increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do a number of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to a world leader, make a call, or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, with 12 years to go to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to get them to demand action, or is it just another clickbait where people feel they're doing something important by signing a statement online or texting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million activities of its supporters, in an effort to achieve a variety of goals.
According to it, these actions have helped world leaders to inform more than USD 37 billion of commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementer partnership committed to 'Taking Children to Their Full Ability', pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help the country end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 texts from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a historic milestone of social injustice", said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 activities calling for improved maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition interventions.
In response to a question on the CWC website, 'What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?'
Global Citizen responded: "It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident of our success because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few of the performers who will be performing at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval 'barrier' to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may use its navy if necessary to avoid hitting Russia's energy market, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially if it is at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy, like they do in Eastern Europe, in the Southern European gut", he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve this.
The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that the sea lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he added.
Zink's statement was addressed to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation representing the 'voice of the US energy consumer'.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, to boost and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "a trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is focused on increasing natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to reject the "impossible" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
'I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of coercion and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers,' said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak at a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US approach has been met with a blow from Germany, who have reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the Berlin and Moscow bilateral agreements.
'I have a big problem with third countries interfering with our energy supply,' said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she is seriously considering running for president in the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes the first lady", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm seriously considering running for president.
Warren also gave a review of President Donald Trump's actions in the House, saying he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has published criticisms of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think he should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "probable" Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run.
32% supported such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% opposed to it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with the possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will officially make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quoting Donald Trump at the rally on Track Palin's PTSD
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
"What my son is going through, what he's going to experience when he comes back, I can relate to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers come back with", he told an audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Okla.
Palin called his son's arrest "a living room" and said of his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back thinking if there's enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all the other military people have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence against a female, interfering in a domestic violence report, and possessing a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia are challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday to support the challenging policy on the asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name has not been released in Grace v. Sessions, the suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August.
The woman said she was abused by her co-conspirator and his violent gang members, but US officials refused her asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, with gangs and domestic violence being major problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum to escape domestic violence.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is contrary to decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement is contrary to that principle,the friends of the court stated in their brief.
The lawyers also argued in a brief statement that denying immigrants entry would harm the U.S. economy, saying they would likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop offering asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"A refugee claim is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 statement.
The shelter was never intended to alleviate all problems - even the serious ones - that people face every day.
Amusing rescue operations in Palos, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
The situation for the survivors was becoming more and more threatening.
"The situation is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her fever-stricken son at the Palu city evacuation center.
Every minute, new people arrive in the ambulance.
There's not enough clean water.
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through the lost belongings and trying to salvage everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which had been damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were laid to rest outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in outdoor conditions for ongoing severe aftershocks.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled the powerful earthquake that shook her hotel room on the fifth floor, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
"I think I was squeezed in the rubble against the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come for the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger.
US ambassador accuses China of harassment with "workplace ads"
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. Daily News regarding the day-to-day benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the surcharge paid by the China Daily to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest circulation newspaper, after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 US Congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, with tariffs adjusted for each other's imports.
Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were designed to catch exporters in states like Iowa because they supported Trump's Republican parties, Chinese and U.S. experts have explained.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, as well as China's largest agricultural exporter, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Des Moines Register op-ed Sunday: "China has now doubled down on its bullying by running a sweetheart ad in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's expensive free speech and free press practices by putting its paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
In contrast, there is only a limited voice in the Beijing street corridor and it does not see the real differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,he added.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts are warning Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh fiasco.
As many Republicans wait and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment surrounding the situation has been mixed, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things can't be taken back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort to get the FBI investigation underway would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington DC Times.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated "November is coming!" at a rally in the Senate lobby, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the confession of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The Democratic Party and the internal revolution are going off the chart", informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news outlet.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters in their 29s who don't like the president and often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony outlining his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts predicted a backlash if Republicans moved forward with the assertion.
"It's become very confusing for the GOP", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they've treated him, Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA (a group that helps Democrats elect), brought this to the attention of the news channel.
However, the American people seem to be a little bit split between those who believe in the testimony of Ford and those who believe in the testimony of Kavanaugh, but a little bit more in support of the former.
A new poll by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford's claims and at least one other allegation against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that would rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a start-up company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the technology agent Inrupt is the company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and to which people access is granted.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online database' or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available in one browser and at the same time.
What makes this personal online database unique is that it allows the user to choose who has access to this information.
The company refers to this as 'personal authorisation through data'.
According to company president John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide the resources, process and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Today, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers who have been hired to work on the project under contract, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to implement a complete change once all their business models are fully supported overnight.
We're not asking their permission.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt aims to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The unveiling of the World War I Victory Cross Memorial stone
The only Church of England to have received a Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home city.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought out his badge on 29 September 1918 in the assault of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper's bullet, not knowing that he had received the highest British military decoration.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "brilliantly symbolic" if the stone were unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in a very thick fog of Japanese and machine-gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it on with "great gallantry" before he single-handedly rushed to one of the machine guns and knocked out three of his opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were something that I know I could never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were the first to be executed after a parade led by the Brentwood Youth Choir.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of this parade" and added that "the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated".
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but all they saw was Piggy Peppat.
Imagine you've been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but you're not shown this major event.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six from the main card, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK all night.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to go head-to-head, the British audience was left speechless by the arrival of Peppa Pig.
Many were not thrilled, especially those who had stayed up until the early hours to see the battle.
One fan described the transition to a children's comic on Twitter as "a bit of a sick joke".
"It's government regulation that at 6 o'clock, the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to children's programming", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, explained when asked about the broadcast.
♪ Peppa Pig ♪ ♪ Yes ♪ ♪ I know you're the one ♪
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they will work on their timetable to take account of the UK viewers in the future.
'If I think about the reconstruction now, I think we can solve this problem in the future,' said Coker.
But if it's 6am Sunday morning there, we can't do it before our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth, and not all of it was friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical glitch.
But there wasn't, it was a government regulation.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're showing six fights instead of five, like we usually do, we were trying to offer the fans more and we just went over time.
This is a very serious situation.
Tom Daley felt that he was a sexist, a sexist.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until high school that he realized that "not everyone is like him".
Speaking on Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, he said he was speaking about gay rights to give others hope.
Also, becoming a parent changed his attitude toward winning the Olympics, making him feel that it was no longer that important.
Your regular longtime host Kirsty Young had to take a few months off because of her illness.
In the first Laverne episode, Daley said that he felt he was inferior to others growing up because it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, those feelings of being unworthy and feeling different have given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was worth something, and not let others down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze-Olympian has become a highly regarded LGBT campaigner, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more than half the countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he's talking about it because he's lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and he wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, came as a surprise to her.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year, but she said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you've been through so much as a young person" - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone her age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, and they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "outlook" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal", he said.
But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't want to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you can't sit in the front row 'cause by then you're gone,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing, and it was only after he had actually stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Heather Small's Proud - which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still gives her goose bumps.

Out of shape, Mickelson was suspended from Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must improve his form to avoid an unfortunate first-place finish.
Mickelson, who will be playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for a double and four-ball.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has so often been for the U.S., the five-time champion split his day into two, being the cheerleader and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not suited to playing on the cramped Le Golf National golf course, where a long, hard course is constantly punishing missed shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face off on Sunday, in his ninth match, against the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his events this week.
With the Americans, who are four points behind in the opening 12 singles matches, off to a rocky start, Mickelson's match could be crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, but he had little else to add.
He fully understood his part of today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow added Furyk.
He's very confident.
He's a celebrity, and he's given so much to our teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but it's what happened and we had to go down that road.
He wants to be out like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record Sunday as the most attended Ryder Cup player.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an extra spiritual boost.
"He's funny, he's mocking, he's witty, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the men's room", he explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun going up against him this week, and it was great to see.
He offers much more than just a game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European fleet knows that the great advance may soon be lost.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from personal experience that a big lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup at the start of the singles can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Danishman made his public debut at the 1997 Valderrama competition, where he and captain Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but by the time he reached the finish line it had drastically diminished, winning by a score of 141⁄2: 131⁄2.
"You will remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great success in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, it came very close", Bjorn said after the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history shows me and the rest of the crew that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out there and you do the right thing.
It's not over until you've got points.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win the cup, so we're focused on that.
I've always said, I'm focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world.
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: 'I don't get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is about a whole new set of obstacles.
Tomorrow is about personal achievement, so it's about something else.
It's nice to be with the other guy when things are going well, but when you're there in person, you're being tested as a full-fledged golfer.
That's the message you need to give the players. Give it your best tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's gonna have to go and make his own way.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better in person than with their opponents, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before becoming part of the losing team when Europe was beaten by the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to being asked how in 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their game on the last day.
We've got 12 big games tomorrow, but you've got to start with fire, like in Brookline and Medina.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-range races.
We'll set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel will make tomorrow's miracle happen.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the competition and he faces off against the best of Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the competition.
"I'll put my boys in this line because I think we're covered", Bjorn said of his selection of singles matches.
Germany's new battleship delayed again
The German Navy's newest fast-cruise ship was due to enter service in 2014, replacing aging Cold War-era warships, but it won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and a snowballing increase in costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class high-speed ferry flagship 'Rheinland-Pfalz' has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was due to join the navy as early as 2014, but troubling post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easier.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class fast rafts.
It is understood that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and audio signal suppression.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the newest speedboats should be able to be sent out of the home port for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which allow Germany to strengthen its power abroad - are already becoming outdated by the time they enter service.
The ill-fated F125 speedboat made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited a number of significant "hardware and hardware deficiencies" that rendered the warship unusable if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg class is manned by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the older Bremen class speedboats.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to incorporate future innovations.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, becomes a problem.
It has been said that it amounts to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newer speedboats become especially important in light of recent warnings that the German Navy is losing power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the navy had in fact run out of 'reportable vessels'.
The official said that this issue had snowballed over time, because the old ships were being removed, but no replacement ships were coming.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class speedboats could join the navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the terrain to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation measures.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, is monitoring the common and soprano piper, as well as the brown long-eared bat and the Daubenton's leatherback bat, in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations in the area to monitor the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting field research using handheld sensors.
Competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency and species of bat calls.
A habitat map and report are then produced to provide a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS wildlife conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the bat population has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated chase-positioning techniques to identify bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained professionals who regularly conduct research, inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Real estate developer David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
"We have a big area for bats in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a big, good place to live.
But there's still a lot to be discovered about bats, so the work we're doing here and in other areas is helping us better understand what they need.
He stresses the importance of checking the bats before any maintenance work on the property, as unwanted destruction of one breeding and birthing site can kill up to 400 females and young, and even exterminate the entire local population.
Leatherback bats are protected and it's illegal to kill, harass or destroy them.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Protection Society, has urged the public to help.
He said, "We have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don't know many of our species and how their colonies feed".
Ronaldo is pushing back on rape charges, while lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue for the charges, which were published in the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayor, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid a woman €330,643.10 to keep her from speaking about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Turning to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live after hours of accusations, Ronaldo, 33, was told it was "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
"Today's news is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's common.
They want to make my name famous, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well", he added with a smile on his face.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for "disclosing unwarranted suspicion regarding privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation for 'moral harm' that is commensurate with the gravity of the offence, which is likely to be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly went back to the player's hotel room, where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed in Nevada with the Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent a good man, one percent a failure".
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it was not consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photos of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he feared "revenge" and was worried about "public humiliation".
Now, the 34-year-old says she's trying to postpone the decision because the alleged incident continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United to join Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italy in a €100 million deal with the giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK may start to regret car makers leaving for good
The UK would "forget it forever" if it lost its status as the world's automotive leader after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt their production at a plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"Let's make a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border crossings could be costly in terms of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK starts to leave the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt in the production process at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Burnaston Toyota's managing director.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without a deal, concerned about the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it's closing its Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line runs on demand with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, and therefore production must be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future of EU relations was 'precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at the border'.
"We want the best solution that will allow us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success, but take advantage of the whole opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually also cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a union representative for Unitex who has worked in Burnasto for 24 years, said that its members are increasingly worried: We know from experience that once jobs disappear, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the fight against top contender Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Mueller's independence has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein never confirmed that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing his intention to resign.
Instead, it was announced Thursday that they would meet with Trump, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who's accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying a Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date is not set yet, it could be this week, but it could be pushed back another week, considering all the things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll look into it, and I'll keep the press informed, as always.
Some journalists would argue that Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
And the host, Chris Wallace, he asked me why.
Sanders said the lack of information was not due to TV journalists intentionally catching the deception, although he added: 'I have no objection to the fact that they are prepared for the deception.'
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president is doing more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said, without adding evidence. "We've looked at these numbers".
The briefing hours will continue, Sanders assured, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot, and you've seen how we've done it over the last couple of weeks, so it's going to be during a press conference, when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated, perhaps why, by standing before a gathering of reporters in a free-range, sometimes bizarre, appearance.
The Minister for Health wrote to EU staff in the NHS in Scotland over Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express the country's thanks and wishes for their post-Brexit retention.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter when there are less than six months until the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: 'The negotiations on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU have continued during the summer, moving towards the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very unsettling time for you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after Saturday's head injury and a 31-27 shot from the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He fell down and just collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen while he was on the floor before he was put on a stretcher and taken off the field for further observation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that the type/ extent of the injury is still unclear and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Redshirt sophomore Abercrombie was in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five fights on Saturday before leaving the game, making it 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty on UK property
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, using the extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This move will undermine Corbyn's efforts to appeal to young voters.
The United Kingdom has not yet adopted a common position on the question of the application of the Temporary Framework.
The Treasury hopes it will generate up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to lure young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The temple tax is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, channelling the extra money to the government's desire to combat domestic violence.
The additional charge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second home and removal purchases - can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the London properties bought are owned by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many of the country's wealthy areas - especially the capital - have become 'gambling towns' thanks to the large numbers of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering the temple tax to help young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when they buy land but don't use it, and called on May to abandon quotas for affordable homes to correct the UK's housing stigma.
Corbyn has announced a sweeping housing reform, including rent controls and an end to the pillage of the innocent.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said, "Last year, I promised to dedicate my life as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live and work and build a life here.
It is true, however, that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as businesses based abroad, have as much access to buying homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland".
Sunderlan's leader, Jack Ross, says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's leader at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, just three points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back into the Scottish Champions League last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to B class and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in the Hamptons, and that's always something that's pulled me back.
But that opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running the club.
Ross was replaced by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, who were also appointed by the Board of Directors.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was unafraid of such big names and big names, having previously held the same at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success is when I can get this club into the Champions League.
"The club is undoubtedly a Champions League club because of its structure and facilities", he said.
It's not an easy task to get to this point, but I only see myself as a success if I can get the club back there.
Ross has been a manager for only three years, having previously been a vice president at Dumbarton and for 15 months on the Hearts management staff.
He then helped Alloale recover from relegation to the third tier and turned St Mirren's bottom position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was a real crossroads, reminiscent of the Alloa takeover.
I really thought that conducting was better for me than acting.
It seems odd, because I did manage, I made a reasonable income and I enjoyed some of the highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things to do every week.
They still do it, given the stress and pressure of their job, but leadership just seems to be more appropriate.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable than I ever have in my adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday, September 30th on Sportsound, Radio Scotland at 12:00 to 13:00 BST.
According to research, the best time to go out is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the running of Britain's struggling pubs, but there's more pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures showed that pub and bar sales rose by 2.7% in July, but that of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
These figures were compiled by Peter Martin of the business consultancy firm CGA: The continued sunshine and England's longer than expected attendance at the World Cup meant that July was similar to June, when pub sales increased by 2.8%, except that restaurants had a more difficult time.
The decline in restaurant sales, which was 1.8% in June, worsened further in July.
The drinking pubs and bars were the most successful, and the restaurants that were the least popular.
Food-based pubs also suffered in the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between the occupied pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales declined by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst on leisure and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It's not surprising that the restaurant chains continue to struggle, even though the 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year is especially painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide some much-needed relief.
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the number of establishments linked to the brand.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data for 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is a well-established industry benchmark.
One in five kids has secret social media accounts they're hiding from their parents
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.

News has raised fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" to show their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, create secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a marked increase in the number of Instagram accounts (referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram).
The news was raising fears that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a 'base account' that was designed to be viewed by their parents and accepted by them.
One who discovered the secret account of his 13-year-old daughter saw that the teenager was inviting others to rape her.
Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), a private school association, found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged having personal accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers being tempted to create online accounts where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the sports spokesperson for the Scottish Athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Executive Board as non-Executive Director at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most acclaimed athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for the sport's leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is respected throughout Scotland, the UK and elsewhere in the sporting community, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit from being invited to his leadership", Beattie said.
Doyle said: 'I want to be an advocate for athletes and hope to make a real contribution to Scottish sport and help it develop.'
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and who now frequently shares his opinion on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and if, and to what extent.
I've been working hard, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed training!

Breast pump commercial comparing women to cows divides the Internet in two
A breast pump company has split the Internet into two camps with ads comparing a breastfeeding mother to a cow that is sucking.
To celebrate the rumoured launch of the world's first silent portable breast pump, consumer-tech company Elvie released an ad similar to the ironic music video to showcase the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who want to live out their lives.
Four real moms dancing on a haystack with the cows and singing, "Yes, I'm licking myself, but you can't see my tail", and "If you haven't noticed, those aren't thighs, those are my breasts".
The verse repeats: "Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, fill with milk my ladies".
However, the ad on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
Viewers of the video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and has received thousands of comments, disagree, many of them saying it sheds light on the dairy industry's backlog.
 Using milk to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth", wrote one.
Elvie's breast pump does not pierce the eyes of the breast-feeding nurse (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: "It's understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these to promote breast pumps for expectant mothers?"
Someone added: "A totally unthinkable ad".
Some of it's for the commercial, and one woman thought it was hilarious.
I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but let's face it.
It's a brilliant product, wrote one.
Another commented: 'It's a fun ad for mothers who pump (often at their jobs or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
This ad is not a praise or a condemnation of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with non-obvious pumps tucked into their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women who pump breast milk feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely silent, with no wires or pipes, and no visible breast-feeding nursing, giving women the freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to go outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: 'Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and provocative introduction.
By comparing the expressive possibilities of women to the dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
A London fashion show featured a mother of two carrying a product designed by Marta Jakubowski.
Thousands of migrant children quietly went to the Texas border camp
The number of migrant children in custody has risen sharply, though monthly crossings have remained fairly consistent, in part because the Trump administration's enforced tough rhetoric and policies have made it difficult for children to be adopted by sponsors.
Normally, most sponsors are documented immigrants, and they're afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in their home country, so they demand custody of the child.
The threat was heightened in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albence testified to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who were seeking financial support for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80% of sponsors or members of sponsors' households are in the country illegally and a large number have a criminal background.
So we're going to keep on tracking them", Mr. Albence said.
To expedite the handling of the children, officials have implemented new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, previously 60 days, shelter workers said.
Many defend their legal content in front of an immigration judge via video conferencing, face to face.
Those unfit to be released will be sent out of the country quickly.
According to shelter workers and based on reports of the system published in recent months, the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent protests or escape attempts.
Lawyers say these concerns are more acute in large detention facilities like Tornillo, where the size of a child can make it difficult to see.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to adjust to the feeling or to say good-bye to their friends could cause trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on the UN General Assembly to welcome Syrian refugees home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualemi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces had been illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism and were being dealt with accordingly.
They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria's "war on terror" is almost over. Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions more have fled their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until we have cleared the entire Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any foreign forces illegally present".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish units as well as Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are favorable and he blamed the unfounded fears that prevent the arrival of refugees for spreading to some Western countries.
We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them in their quest,' she said.
They're politicizing something that's purely a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction assistance to Syria until there is an agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create the Idlib buffer zone, the last rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for political talks to move forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale incursion by Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made demands for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is running for a second term
By this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal hadn't ended his presidency earlier, as liberal viewers would presumably want.
Which should be the end of the excitement of the presidency.
At this time, the audience shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during its peak hour, up from 1.7 million four years ago. The MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has 3.5 million viewers on cable, keeping its ratings high during the main evening news broadcast.
"It's a tension we're in because we don't understand it", the head of Designated Survivor told ABC about the secretary of state who becomes president when an attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovelli, an accomplished comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said he made me laugh", Mrs. Scovell said to me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Although not as well as other TV shows, the Washington rumors could prove fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and to the families of immigrants seeking to reunite and to the global economy.
Staying off the trail is just a luxury for privileged viewers.
But a six-hour expert's talk, featuring the "in-depth background research" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", and Paul Manafort's $13,225.73 bomber jacket (the Washington Post called it "a very confident blown-out suit") and Stormy Daniels's reflections on Mr. Trump's anatomy, is needed by more than just an educated citizen.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario with the same feeling again.
"One of his activities that may seem like a reality show is that he shares something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pandemic Hour", with the changing cast of Trump's show and daily schedules (fucking the NFL, praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't leave a single thing unattended or you're out of time.
This week, Fleiss was in his home on the north shore of Kauai, 80 degrees hot, but he'd been crawling into his room to watch MSNBC while taping CNN.
He couldn't help but watch Brett Kavanaugh perform in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court hang in the balance.
"I remember how in my day we did all kinds of crazy shows and people said this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Elsewhere, the cash flows are going to the acrimonious White House midterms.
It's no wonder the 17th Pennsylvania district is getting a cash inflow from the congressional redistricting, putting two market-dominating entrepreneurs in the same spot.
This has resulted in the re-election of the representative for the suburban Pittsburgh district, the Republican Conor Lamb, who won the special election for the second district last spring.
Lamb's opponent is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th District, which covers most of the new 17th.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's January decision that the old districts were divided into unconstitutional electoral districts, favoring Republicans.
The new 17th election has unleashed a campaign that is being trumpeted by the financial departments of the two largest parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a close race in the highly-watched March 18 snap election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This is the same place that's been held by a Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political establishment has given the Democrats a slight edge.
The US El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then withdrawn
Diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback for Washington.
Mr. Trump met in June 2017 in a friendly atmosphere with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Vare, and owned the Panama Hotel until the partners fired the management team of the Trump company.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that those countries had stopped supporting Taiwan recently.
But the only sanction was planned for El Salvador, which received $140 million in 2017 in aid from the United States, including for drug control, development and economic boost.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to follow up on a similar meeting last year, seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the meeting and end any discussion of sanctions in El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is now being questioned, who will speak at a mid-October meeting to discuss government positions.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh Washington notices or punishments.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The history of education
The next thing that might happen is that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump's possible miscarriage of justice, which is documented in the National Archives.
Mueller is reportedly also investigating whether the Trump campaign is connected to the Russian attack on our election.
If Congress should change sides, Trump must report to this body as if he were going to speak to voters again and perhaps even to his fellow justices.
There are a lot of aghas here, and I don't want to imply that the reversal of Trump or his European comrades is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would stop him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We were left to fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and fuss and
History is revolving around such turning points, and the ruthless march of democracy is approaching or pushing back.
The American people are now facing several turning points.
What are we going to do when Trump sacks Rod Rosenstein, the deputy director of the D.A.'s office, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since he was reported to have made a suggestion to secretly record the president's speech last year and speculated about his unsuitability for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times's statement is inaccurate.
How do you react when the FBI's newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is neither complete nor fair - or when he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections if Trump is to be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter break.
But I believe we will not fail, because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me a candlelit Saturday on a table with a hook.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the battle of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Australia, following an impressive win against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to send them to the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season before the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to get better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal have a strong opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could do something and we left with a point.
We may have been able to achieve more, but in general, it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another great and important European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was tough, because of that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling inside.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move on, put the last season behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of the pension-related fear
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had discussed the subject with their children.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", explained Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
But that's where we should start.
Discuss with your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for care without them knowing your wishes beforehand.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, since these choices can be costly.
Consult your financial adviser: Your adviser may have a good plan for how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or asset self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary cash.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles from the start.
Get a health services authorisation to identify a trusted person to monitor your care and ensure that specialists follow your wishes when you cannot communicate.
Also consider a fiduciary in connection with your financial affairs.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your grandmother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write these things down so that you will be ready when you need to be.
"It's not just the financial side, but also the doctors who are important", explained Martin.
What medicines are needed?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put it all together.
A man was shot several times in Ilfracombe with an air rifle
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home after a night out.
In the 1940s, a victim in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. last night, as an accidental act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking all witnesses to contact them.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is still rising.
With communications down, rescuers have been unable to get any information from the Donggala Regency north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the city following the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, and has an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The town was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Regency is a region that extends over 300 km (180 mi) in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regents, an administrative district of the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities in Central Sulawesi Province, especially the Donggala Coast.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, being concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, over the past 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Rim and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh, in North Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern tip of Indonesia's most populated island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An area near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province, was hit by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatra, Mentawai, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic, reminding people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami struck that time, but more than 100 people died in collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on domestic abuse charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a female person tried to notify the police of alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Detention Center and is being held on $500 unsecured bond, the CTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he announced that he was not guilty in any way, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, police have called in his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in the home, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm, all while intoxicated.
Her friend said he punched her in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia followed by tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the outskirts of central Sulawesi, which lies to the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
In New York City, federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York, a rare punishment for a federal crime not executed since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, swamping both pedestrians and cyclists in his path in October.
According to the death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims intentionally and intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, court records indicate that the death penalty is a possible punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on a 22-count indictment that included two counts of murder plus extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack "represents a massive plan and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "violent, cruel and depraved".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,' is the intention of the applicant.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the last death was heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Khalid Barnes, the defendant, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was carried out in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native believer, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with the work.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that an ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital.
On the 22 counts, he has not admitted guilt.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "clearly disappointed" in the ruling.
'In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty prolongs the trauma of all those involved rather than the life sentence without the possibility of parole for those who admit to being guilty,' said Patton.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP has called for Nigel Farage to be appointed as Brexit negotiator.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during today's Tory conference protest.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should have known the 'heat' of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's own MPs had suggested himself to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on March in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May is facing a problem reconciling her deeply divided ranks, which were highlighted by pro-Remain Conservatives joining her anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track amid attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the backlash, forcing Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between his package and the 'Case'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wanted to abandon the Chequers plan.
He suggested taking Farage on as a partner and putting him in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
'With his help, we would be out of here by now,' he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: 'I am in favour of Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers plan.'
In his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in the world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is not true".
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, telling reporters: "I'll say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition doesn't vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists, who actually walk down the street and vote for us.
Please abandon Chequers' plan and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: "Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Farage said politicians at the rally should be made to feel "hot" if they plan to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let that happen".
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel uncomfortable.
We will mobilize the popular army of the country that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
Meanwhile, the survivors marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists were waving "Tories against Brexit" slogans after the group was formed this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security concerns that their party's application became part of when opening the conference.
'These are the people who say they can put IT systems in place and bring all the technology to Canada and more, to smoothly cross the border, to trade across the border without restrictions to Ireland,' he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' she added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren of the United States says she's seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts town hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in the November election against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's speculation that he might be a contender for the 2020 presidential race.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the House since Trump took office.
A member of the audience asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for the women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means the forelegs, too.
Arrested in connection with the LSU Sims shooting
LA Police in Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that a suspect in the Friday night shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at approximately 11 a.m.
They released the video of the shooting Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, via 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got himself shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, to possessing the weapon and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them starts, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after a team record gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel.
From that moment on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas had qualified on Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team's line-up would play a big role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost knocked Hamilton out of his game as he defended his position on the first two throws and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first into the pit stops, leaving Hamilton's group in the back of the heavy traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went on to lead after a side situation when the Ferrari driver left the inside flank loose to pass after a double-leap attempt to protect it at turn three.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving the tyres to the finish and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He finally made it to the pit stop on lap 44, but he failed to increase his speed on the last eight laps, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
Today is a hard day because Walter did a great job all week and was a real gentleman in letting me pass.
"The team has done a great job to have one of the two", said Hamilton.
That was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump has scolded Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over the incident for not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the time, which showed that people are "evil, hateful and deceitful".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that is happening right now, that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, is that you see people who are angry and angry, who are mean and hateful and lying", he said.
If you look at the press releases and the leaks, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, "Did you leak the document?"
Oh, my God.
I didn't leak.
Just a second.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak", he added with a senator's face.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July about the allegations against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations or leak his story", Feinstein told the committee.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and as requested, I did.
But his denial was not a fit for a president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: "You know what, that was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's one of the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually abusing three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They have decided to take back power without any means of choice.
You see the cruelty and the disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to overcome to get power and control", the president of the Media reported.
Dundee Stars 5 , 3 Belfast Giants , the team that won the league .
Patrick Dwyer of the Giants scored two goals against Dundee.
Dundee Stars beat Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League replay on Saturday, who lost to Dundee 5 - 3.
The Giants came into the game early with a two-goal lead over Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to victory before Dwyer led the Giants back to the pennant.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee's side before the goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat for Adam Keefe's men in the Premier League, as they came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season, and the Giants had won three of the previous four.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford, while Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
Sullivan brought home a quick 13-10 in the first quarter before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the winning field goal at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead before the first break, hitting his second home run of the night late in the first quarter.
The home side came back together and Bouchard brought them back to the level, scoring in a very dominant time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-round lead late in the second quarter, securing a last-third victory for their team in the attack zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
A flight attendant dies to save hundreds of people from an earthquake
An Indonesian flight controller was proclaimed a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
Friday's massive earthquake on the island of Sulawesi triggered a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of whom are still unaccounted for.
The area is being overrun by strong tidal waves and many people are trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung escaped from the tower of the towering airfield at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure the safe takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the airline's flight path at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the turret, thinking it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter even got to Palos.
We were extremely saddened to hear about this. added the press spokesman.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, and the National Disaster Mitigation Agency has restricted access to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Bootong.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: The death toll could rise as the bodies of many victims are still under the rubble and have not been recovered.
Tides of 20 feet [6.0 m] devastated the town of Palu, where a mass is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes will provide support and equipment.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News, "The hospital is bringing in new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Everywhere, small shops are being looted.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they might find there.
It's a tragedy already, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palus on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?
Earlier this year, the Indonesian city of Lombok was struck by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
While it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airline that piloted the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims that one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to locate a single male passenger.
The airline said they're working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it landed at Chuuki Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but were in stable condition.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
One American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was flying at a very low altitude.
"It's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to swim through the water at a high altitude to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He mentioned that the salon staff was panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy and sailors working on a nearby pier also assisted in the rescue, using inflatable boats to ferry the people ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet [30 m] underwater.
The data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving air carriers registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
The analyst is compiling a timeline from the night the woman was burned alive.
The U.S. Attorney's Office on Saturday closed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, spent hours as an expert witness analyzing the intelligence.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old plaintiff Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the girl's death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location information from several cell phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted the young man's earlier claims.
When the records showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said Tellis lied because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before the girl died.
Phone records show the bride and groom had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to give its court speech on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will go to a grand jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to fight negative genre definitions by adding positive messages to their music.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hip hop has moved away from its political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently been gaining popularity again in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?!
A nanny in New York is suing for a racist message about a couple.
A nanny in New York is suing for discriminatory dismissal of a couple after they accidentally received a text from a family member complaining that the nanny was "just another black person".
Couple denies they're racist, compared to blackmailing the situation.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her outrage when she learned that their new pantry operator, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a note to her husband that said, "Ellllllllllllllllllllllllll, EXTREMELY MUSTANHAL".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, an uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice after her understanding of the situation, claiming that their sociable nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and had waited for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home on an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for the severance pay he wants to get, $350 a day for the next six months, and the same job he was hired to do, but without a contract.
'I want to show them to look, so to do,' she told The Post newspaper, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
A couple have dismissed the claims that they're racist, saying that ending their working relationship with Maurice was a smart move because they were afraid that after he insulted the girl, they couldn't trust him anymore.
My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
But would you give your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on now.
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from giving birth and was in a 'very difficult situation'.
Would you go up against someone like that?
"That's not very nice", added the investment banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the couple has been swiftly condemned by public opinion on social media, where they have been heavily criticized for their behavior and thinking.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's editors feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said in the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read this for the first time before it was published.
It's very exciting to hear what we know about Paddington's big breakthrough.
He said that his father, inspired to write the children's book by a little teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic after his job was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was overshadowed by the death of his father last year.
Of Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he added that his father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet man, and not a proud man", he said.
But because Paddington was so real to her, it was like the feeling when your child accomplishes something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your direct achievement.
I believe he viewed Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"They called regularly to say that her daughter was very sick and that they did not think she would survive", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad, who said my daughter would die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medication the doctors had given him to keep his heart beating had begun to disappear slowly and leave his system.
He was dead for a while before that, and now all the systems are shutting down.
I was just supposed to sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her ordeal.
"Nobody knew", he said.
I kept my head down and tears were running down my face the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outpouring of compassion for Nadia on that flight.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.
Postcards from a woman lying on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their beloved suicide nails work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put cards on the bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Miss Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said her smile made the whole room shine.
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was in a very bad place with his hands.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this is going to have a domino effect".
Miss Davis created these cards to let people know that there are people to turn to and to talk to, even to your friend.
Don't shut up. You have to talk.
Miss Humphreys, who had been a friend of Miss Davis for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", he said.
We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on his first Christmas, when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything.
Miss Humphreys said that the death of the man was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: "It's tearing a wound in the whole family.
It's going to tear us apart.
But we must move on and continue the fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
'I believed that if we could actually get something that he wanted, with a limited time and scope of investigation, we might be able to achieve unity,' Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would fall apart amidst the persistent partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their distaste was due to the times.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do as well as they'd like, they'll be significantly weakened in their bid to elect the man they want to be the next chief justice of the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote is in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear at this point whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korean troops are decreasing under Kim's rule.
South Korean lawmakers have said that the number of North Korean troops entering South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said the number of military drillings had decreased to 1,127 in the previous year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
A large number of North Korean military leaders have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to the Seoul Times, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest national border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China treats the exiles as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their home countries.
Relations between North and South Korea, technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of the stalled nuclear weapons.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for not making progress on sanctions.
'Without trust in the United States, our country has no security and in these circumstances we have in no way agreed to be the first to unilaterally disarm,' Mr Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House of Representatives Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I felt it was inevitable that if a woman had acted in this way, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, almost yelling at times and at times speechless describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democratic Party members on the committee, calling the charges against him over Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election a "grotesque and coordinated assassination" organized by liberals angry with the party.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the Democrats were to win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this much, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to be a Supreme Court justice, he's unfit to be on the court where he currently serves", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about possible rulings against Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act (healthcare law) or Roe v. Wade (abortion law court precedent) because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
'This is not the time for a hysterical person to become a judge and expect us to say, 'Isn't it nice?'' said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair-word, a rage that's been raging for months and years, and he can't get away from it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, is it?
He continued: "I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere; she said she also cried when she got angry, but she worked out a method that consisted of when she got angry and started to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm mad. I'm mad at you.
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius.
Drops are accepted as an expression of rage in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from a thief in a male-dominated office, where I found myself once crying in an indescribable rage when an older woman - a strict manager, whom I had always feared a bit - grabbed me and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and that gives them pleasure.
Patricia Schroeder, a native Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his husband's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on board a yacht called Monkey Business and ended his campaign, an exasperated Schroeder thought there was no reason why he shouldn't consider running for president himself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughingly 30 years later.
Juba put seven candidates forward and the last thing they needed was another one to join them.
Someone said it was like Snow White and the Seven Thumbs.
As the campaign was winding down, he was late with his fundraiser and he vowed not to run unless he got two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who had given the men $1,000 were giving him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so moved by the gratitude of the people who supported her, by the annoyance with the system that made it difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of delegates, and by the hatred of sexism that she was so overcome by that she had tears in her throat.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press against him.
You'd think Kleenex would be my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
Did he cry?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The trade war between the US and China has been a drain on the open, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a rift between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning this year, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was the new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, essentially putting a tax on half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of between 5% and 10% on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to hit the US back, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to blink any time soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean giving in to demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, a trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
'The fact that a hasty policy decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that result in another country losing control of its economy is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,' said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security who focuses on Asia.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
The situation on the territory of the country is now more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, she said.
The government is continuing to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now all the conditions are in place for refugees who left the country because of terrorism and because of unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods to return voluntarily.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5 at Le Golf National, near Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had been in the mix for the entire tournament, hit a par-3 on the 16th hole, giving the win to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to have scored 5:0:0 in the current format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
The American, Jordan Spieth, was beaten by the lowest-placed European, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, with a score of 5 and 4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has beaten the Englishman Ian Poulter, 2 and 1, who could have been the last Ryder Cup winner.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the most successful European in the competition's history with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we got the cup back.
It's about team spirit and I'm happy to be able to help", said an emotional Garcia after the European win.
He's giving the clutch to fellow American Jon Rahm, who won Sunday in a singles match against US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1.
"I'm extremely proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. "I grew up watching him", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was busy finding the fairway all weekend; the exceptions were Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S.A. said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they were brave.
There was a time in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did a very good job.
I'm gonna get my act together, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to lift the hat.
We were outplayed.
New information on water pollution: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a decline in the overall concentration of blooming algae in the Tampa Bay area.
FWC said there were reports of more loose growth in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The watershed extends approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The bodies can be found 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
Water splashes have been reported in Pasco County.
During the past week, average concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County from coastal or open ocean, low to high in Hillsborough County from low to high in open ocean, low to high in Manatee County, low to high in coastal and open ocean in Sarasota County, low to medium in Charlotte County, low to high in Lee County from coastal and open ocean, and low to high in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory distress in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory distress in Northwest Florida in the last week.
