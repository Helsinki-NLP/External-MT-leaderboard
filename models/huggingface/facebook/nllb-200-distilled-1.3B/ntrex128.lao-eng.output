Members of Parliament worried about 'looking like robots'
There was a furor among some state legislators over the suggestion that their names should be changed to MWPs (temporary members of parliament).
It was created as a result of the renaming of the Parliament to the Provisional Parliament.
MPs from all political parties are concerned that it will cause a riot.
A Labour MP said his group was worried "it will vote with Twp and Pwp".
For the out-of-time reader: in the time language twp stands for fool and pwp stands for fool.
Plaid councillor said all groups were "displeased" and suggested alternatives.
The Conservatives in the House of Commons said his group was "open" to the name change, but acknowledged it was short for MWP for Muppet.
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire pronunciation in English of the letter u.
The parliamentary committee, which is now drafting legislation to propose the name change, said: "The final decision on what to call the parliamentarians is clearly a matter for the parliamentarians themselves".
The 2017 Government Act gives the Council the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on a widely supported proposal to call the parliament a provisional parliament.
In terms of MP names, the committee wants to be called the WMPs, but the MWP option has received the most support in public debate.
The lawmakers will propose alternatives, but attempting to reach a majority vote could be a headache for the Speaker, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes in the coming weeks.
The reform bill would include other changes to the way the council operates, including rules on disqualification of councillors and the design of the committee system.
Members of Congress will get the final vote on what to call them when they debate the bill.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was created to try to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor reflects a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's bid for EU and NATO membership.
The incumbent Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will not be interested in the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that simply changing the name is the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The St. Martin's procession is silent as Harlem's churches are packed.
"In the past", Adams says, "the elders I spoke to said there were bars and churches everywhere".
"Today, there is none".
He said that Bar's disappearance was understandable.
"People are living differently" today, he says.
"The bar is no longer a playroom in the neighborhood where people go to regularly".
For the church, he worries that the money from the property sales won't last as long as the leaders expected, "and soon they'll be back where they started".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with condos full of people who would not help the sheltered areas of the neighborhood.
He said, "The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be white", "and so we will rush to the point where these churches are all closed because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condoms will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the capital of the black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
A gathering of white Methodist Nicomassists who had moved out in the 1930s.
A gathering of nearby worshippers occupied the seats of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a group of white men under the leadership of John Howard Johnson who led a strike of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting white people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Johnson's church planned to rebuild, they made a concerted effort.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Rev. Johnson and a probation officer in St. Martin's, called the series "poor man's probation".
The experts who published the collection in July called it by different names: "Cultural Treasure" and "Inreplaceable Historical Instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a specialist at Michigan State University, added that it was the world's first organ set to be played by the folk musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ set at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a rich myth of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others brought in by the jurisdiction of the bishops.
The church committee, a ward council made up of lay leaders, wrote to the county governor in July with concerns that the county would seek to tell the county's council about the cost of further construction. The church council had no involvement in hiring architects and contractors sent by the county.
Some churchgoers complained about the transparency in the governor's office.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while swimming in a mangrove swamp in California.
Authorities say a fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was drinking mango juice in California, the opening day of the mango season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy cry for help and then jumped in with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching a dragon, but then he realized he was screaming "I'm being bitten!"
I was bitten!
Hammel recalled what he noticed as soon as he approached the boy.
"I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a fish in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused this attack is unknown.
Ton rescue team leader Larry Giles told reporters that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not classified as a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries that extended to his upper lung area.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles states that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered endangered.
Sainbury's scheme pushed into the UK beauty market
Sainburys is launching Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams along with a walk-in beauty shop in the form of a convenience store with specialist assistants.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homewares decline, the larger beauty retailer will be piloted with 11 stores nationwide and adding more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investing in beauty becomes looking for a big store to find a way to collect charges when being sued for telephones, microphones and home appliances.
Sainburys says it will scale up its beauty line to 3,000 times its combined Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
The existing boundaries from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burts Bee will have more space with a similarly sized area for merchandise found in stores such as Boots.
The market also opened up boutique cosmetics to make most products vegan-friendly, something younger buyers want more of.
The fragrance shop will also be piloting a run at two Sainsbury's stores with the first opening in Croydon, south London, over the weekend while another in Selly Oak, Birmingham, opened later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to smaller daily purchases at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the store would look more like a supermarket as supermarket chains tried to compete with discount providers Aldi and Lidl with more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of residential options since buying both stores two years ago, which has turned retail into a more profitable business.
Supermarket attempts to reform beauty departments and drug stores end in failure.
Sainsbury's experimented with investing in Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a series of mergers to separate the revenues from the supermarket pharmacy.
The new strategy comes from Sainsbury's selling 281 pharmacy businesses to Celesio, who owns Lloyda Pharmacy for £125 million, in the last three years.
Lloyds said it would play a role in the plan by expanding its range of luxury skincare brands to include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said: "We are changing the look and feel of our beauty walks and improving the environment for our customers".
We've also invested in partners who have been specially trained who will be looking for guidance.
Our range of brands has been designed to fit all needs and environments with the luxury and convenience of the seaside, where we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old fashioned shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby cancelled a £11 million contract
Peter Jones of Dragons Dens left in a fit of rage after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled his £11 million contract with lifestyle brands to focus on his new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for Truly, a brand of home furnishings and jewelry.
Their business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter posted on Instagram to announce that he was stepping down.
Holly Willoughby has passed away, and Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, is furious and cancels his lucrative lifestyle business deal at the last minute to focus on his new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was upset when the TV's Golden Girl admitted during a press conference on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, about his new deal worth around £1.5 million which meant he would no longer have time to devote to the Truly brand, their home appliances and jewellery brand.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and doubled Wiloughby's wealth by around £11 million.
When Wiloughby, 37, posted on Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones drove from Britain to one of his hometowns.
Sources say: "True is currently Holly's first priority.
It's going to be a long-term future to see him in the next few decades.
His decision to resign has left everyone involved truly stunned.
No one believes with what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to a new opening.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's house that's ready for sale.
Experts believe the resignation of the president of This Morning, who is among the richest British billionaires, could cost the company millions due to massive investments in a range of products from chairs and diamonds to clothing and home furnishings and sustainability at the next launch.
And it could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby's mother of three and husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, a 52-year-old man, joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones held a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become M&S's brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said tonight: "We will not comment on his business dealings".
A violent conversation and then we fall in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for expressing what some would consider "not good" opinions about the president and for thinking positively of the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so happy?
Trump speaks in the voice of his islanders.
I didn't hear anything.
He added that Kim was interested in a second summit after Trump hailed the first summit in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
But the talks to denuclearize are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong-Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a backlash from the United States over North Korea's initial denuclearization.
On the contrary, he added that the United States is moving towards a coercive approach to creating pressure.
Trump has taken a more positive approach in his rally speech.
He said, "We're doing well with North Korea".
We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
We have a very good relationship with them now.
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to a very positive response: an end to the censorship, an independent release and the repatriation of American soldiers.
And he defends his strange way of discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stadium, we have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds.
Affected after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs are said to be unwanted.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, there is no national disaster alert, which is a first step to mobilizing international aid.
Sumbung says unfortunately, in many cases they are very clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a bit challenging.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign officials will be able to work in the field.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Unit, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international teams would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
With Indonesia experiencing constant earthquakes, the country remains unprepared for tragic natural disasters.
While a fish sanctuary is being built in Aceh, they are not visible to the public from another coast.
The lack of a tsunami warning in Palu despite warnings has led to deaths.
In the best of times, inter-island travel in many of the islands in Indonesia is considered a challenge.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult than ever.
A hospital ship operating in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo refurbished Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure for his election campaign and spent huge sums on roads and railways.
But a lack of funding has caused problems in Joko's administration, which he faces a new election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the party divide in Indonesia where members of the majority Muslims have adopted a conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and 10 out of 1,000 were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought each other in the streets, using knives, bayonets and mortars, and other weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool enters the deep tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team were leading 1-0.
He slowly batted to his left foot before shooting the ball into the far post.
The ball that was being played jumped high above the penalty area as it leapt into the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga who was jumping and hit the net.
"It's just trying to get in that position, to get the ball and Shaq's players are playing in front as much as possible, and I'm trying to make as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante running up and he needed a kick and I didn't think much about it and I just wanted to shoot him.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after being scored in the 25th minute by Belgian giant Eden Hazard.
The Blues' striker used a slipper to return the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the points match before shooting from the centre and running into Liverpool's territory.
Kovacic receives the ball and passes it quickly from the center.
He then made a nice shot that put Hazard in the penalty area.
Hazard ran through the opposition and kicked a left-footed shot into the goalpost from a distance through Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The National Disaster Management Unit said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
There are reports that many people are still trapped in buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused a 20-foot high tidal wave, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the unit, said in a press release.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has begun after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, along with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area to report anything they saw or heard.
Police detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us".
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have any of the footage from the surveillance camera, to contact us because they may have information that is very important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body of the woman who was discovered was a local in Birkenhead and he was discovered at the residence.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman arrived at the scene to ask about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police say they are in the process of notifying the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his rental room but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He didn't speak when he knew what was happening.
Those who stayed were told to wait several hours before they would be allowed to return.
The officer told one man that the entire area was now seen as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene with tears in her eyes.
He kept saying that it was cruel.
At 2pm, two police vans were parked in the police station with another outside.
Several officers stood in a police circle to observe the rented room.
Anyone with information can send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers secretly on 0800 555 111 with a reference to the 247 recording of the 30 September incident.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament was the latest monumental phenomenon to be controversially re-written in history.
Removing the statue would be a retaliation for his massive destruction of British cultural and religious objects as the Taliban were run by his brother's Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society dismissed Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable that the current debate about moving statues will lead to the targeting of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace".
The destruction of the English Civil War relics was not the order or operation of Cromwell.
Sometimes Cromwell would pretend to sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
The beautiful statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th century opinion and is part of the folk history of a person whom everyone believes still deserves to be admired.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was respected by many who sometimes in the late 19th century had more than now to defend Parliament against outside pressure in his case of a monarchy.
There has been a continuing historical debate about whether or not that was all legitimate official protest.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century set the stage for the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was an easily remembered figure who represented one side of that divide.
Her success as a protective mother deserves to be celebrated and also remembered.
The turtle killed Chinese farmers.
A pig in a market in southwestern China attacked and killed a farmer, local media reported.
The man, who only claimed his surname Yuan, was found dead with a large, blood-filled, missing vein near a pig market in Liupanshui city in Guizhou province, the Southeast China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A chicken farmer prepares to vaccinate a chicken in a chicken coop on May 30, 2005 in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 matches at a market.
The next morning, his nephew's relatives found him dead and found the door to the nearby burial chamber open.
He said that in the pig colony there was a big pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that 550 heavy trucks had bitten the farmer to death, according to reports.
My nephew's legs are covered in blood and partially missing, said his nephew, who goes by the nickname of Wu Wu, as reported by the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV video showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed him was not Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told local news that the pig was being held to prevent harm to others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly in negotiations to recover his death.
However, it is a rare case of mosquitoes damaging the human body as has been previously documented.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their own farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound wheel hit a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC that normally chickens don't progress, but the taste of the blood can be "stimulating".
They just like yoke.
They're very curious and they don't mean you any harm.
You just have to show them proper respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa have caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
According to weather reports, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in a few days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, becoming a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. on Sunday in the eastern time zone and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Storm Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area began to form in the northern Pacific Ocean and moved eastward toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it would begin to push tropical moisture deeper north into the southwestern United States.
Storm Rosa will bring a maximum of 10 inches of rainfall across Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture reacts to the approaching low pressure area, causing heavy rainfall in the southwest in a matter of days.
In local areas, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause flash flooding, landslides and potentially desert landslides.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour there, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Flash floods can occur in conditions where the precipitation is rapid because tropical rainfall is diffuse.
It is not advisable to risk walking in the desert with the danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn the grass into torrential rivers, and heavy rains can cause strong winds and dust storms.
The incoming low pressure area is bringing heavy local rainfall to the coastal region of southern California.
Rainfall in excess of half an inch is possible, which can cause small debris flows along the roads.
This may be the first area to have rain in their rainy season.
Some rainfall began to enter Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before falling more heavily on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain and heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and into Wednesday.
In October, extreme temperature fluctuations can be seen across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain extremely warm.
Sometimes this has led to large changes in temperature in a short period of time.
There is a good example of the huge temperature difference across the central United States on Sundays.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In just a few days, the slowly warming summer will try to build and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to see warm temperatures beginning in October with a temperature of 80 degrees from the Souther Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched all six channels of testimony by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday and the woman he allegedly assaulted, 1980's Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political controversy continues with a last-minute show on Friday: the Arizona Senate's deal to give FBI agent Jeff Flake a week of probation.
Ford commented to the judge that the woman who witnessed the incident was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had raped and attempted to rape her while drunk at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, with a passionate voice, said he was 100 percent confident that no such incident had occurred.
It's like the more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen viewers on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of shows on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNC.
Some of the networks that have been removed have no viewership figures, such as PBS, C-SPAN and The Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen had a hard time measuring the number of people who watched from the office on a regular basis.
To understand the perspective of a large audience, such as the crowd at a tennis semi-final or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen interviewed Fox News Channel's owners for their support of Kavanaugh's position, which led to an average audience of 5.69 million as of the morning hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
There are still many who are interested even after the trial is over.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's events.
After U.S. officials issued a statement saying they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested for taunting protesters Friday morning from CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to climb up to the judge's hearing.
He stood with his eyes glazed over for several minutes as he was criticized via a CNN live feed.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you right now".
"Do you really think he's telling the truth to the whole country?
He said, "You have a power that most women don't".
Flake said his office had orders and said before the window closed: "He has more to say about the committee's consideration".
The entire cable and broadcast network went live hours later as the judge voted Kavanaugh's nomination out of the entire vote of the House.
But Flake said he would do the same if he realized the FBI would investigate the nomination within a week, since a democratic minority had pushed for it.
Flake was inspired in this section by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Congressman Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several lawmakers, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice is powerful because the American people will not vote for Kavanaugh's acquittal without a prior investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
UK Prime Minister says critics are 'playing politics' around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May and her critics have said they plan to leave the EU in a "political game" with Britain's future and undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to arrive at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In another of his press-cut interviews, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson attacked his so-called Brexit grain plan, referring to a proposal that Britain and the European Union should tax each other as "completely unusual".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
An official video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released, and police said that Sims had lost his eyelid during the fight.
Police recovered the window from the scene and said they found Simson's DNA there, WAFB reports on CBS Group.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he admitted to being a woman in the Wayde shooting.
His net worth is pegged at $350,000, according to the attorney's report.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Cemetery released initial reports on Friday, saying the cause of death was the use of a shotgun with a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The department is trusting Louisiana State Refugee Police, the state police Crime Prevention Division, the Southern Police Academy and local citizens to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva praised law enforcement on the ground for "integrity and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
His rebounds averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "saddened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"Is this what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
A volcano has erupted in Mexico City.
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it was hit by a volcanic eruption that produced 183 gas canisters and 24 hours of ash.
The unit examined several loud noises and vibrations.
Images on social media showed some layers of cyclists almost skinny in front of cars in neighboring Mexico City, such as Xochilco.
Physicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico City in September 2017.
The volcano named "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the final round of voting.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, followed by clashes between protesters and riot police, and meanwhile thousands of people took part in a protest to mark the first round of voting in the same direction in Catalonia.
The group of land-dividing tigers were arrested by riot police with egg-laying and paint-powder spraying, creating a black cloud of dust along the roads that had lasting consequences for tourists.
The riots continued the next day as police used riot gear in the fight.
For hours, the freedom protesters chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" in the face of a group of union members chanting "Spain, go deep".
A total of 14 people were treated for minor injuries in the protests, local news reports.
Protests remain high in the autonomous region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters chose to be largely independent, although the output was low compared to those who dissented. Most of those people were voting fraud.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the upcoming elections in which polling stations across the region were violently divided.
Independent groups camped out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The protests continued but were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the land-sharing protest with his wife, said: "I no longer hope to have a chance to see freedom in Catalonia".
"Last year we lived in the best of times.
I gave my parents tears of joy that we could choose but now we have to be quiet", he said.
Despite a major but decisive victory in the December elections, the Catalan pro-independence party has been a bit of a force to be reckoned with this year with many of its most prominent leaders either in self-exile or in detention pending evidence for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old nurse who recorded a protest in support of his telephone police, said the conflict originated from politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more annoying", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Confirming as a candidate for election to the European Parliament is the best way to say goodbye to the backlash against democratic values and the pressure we see from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Young man arrested after house collided with car.
Three young men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car collided with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the windows and the building.
The car may have been pulled from any point of the vehicle.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 lead over the Rangers.
The first goal from Dolly Menga gives Livingston the win.
Livingston's promotion has already upset Rangers to the point where Steven Gerrard has been relegated for the second time in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's suspension proved to be a different story as did Gary Holt's move to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are still one point away from winning the Premiership this season and face the heartthrobs, who are eight points behind on Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has expanded their division to six games, with head coach Holt maintaining a taste of the weakness since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against the Invisible Visitor.
Holt's team would have gone far before they scored, with their stalling making the Rangees trouble at every turn.
Scott Robinson scored but he pulled his effort to the goal, so Alan Lithgow was able to control his own intrusion attempt that came in front of Craig Halkett and made him shoot across the goal.
The hosts were intent on letting the Rangers play their own game, as they knew the Rangers might cause problems for the fans.
And that's the kind of goal that's important.
Rangers accepted a free-kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to arrange Menga, who intercepted and scored from the center of the court.
In the process, the Rangers took possession of the ball but the defensive development from the home side made the pass impossible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely attacked.
That format continued to be used into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was forced to record from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was kicked by goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow put the ball out of Livingston's other set.
The cut continued into Livingston's area and continued to be handled while there were two penalties from Glenn Middleton's challenge and another from the player's hand.
'Appearance' from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland correspondent Alasdair Lamont in the area of Tony Macaroni.
Show the play and the results for Livingston.
For the young men, they have been very successful, continuing to exceed expectations on this path of progress.
Their playing style and personality are unchanged since they returned from the first flight, but a good way to raise Holt is because he has impressed his team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
With Tan Halkett once a great, formidable defensive tackle, but in the meantime Menga also keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worral on their team.
Although the Rangers have always lacked inspiration.
Fortunately they had that time under Gerrard, they felt good about missing those criteria.
Their last ball was a defective one-off, which they cut off the opening home run and it was something that made the Rangers find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed response in Cologne
There were both rainbows and a bright sky on Saturday (September 29) as the captains of Turkey and Germany met at Breakast in Berlin.
It was President Erdogan's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have a range of issues including human rights, freedom of expression and joining the Turkish military.
Erdogan heads to Cologne to open a new and massive mosque.
The city is also home to the largest proportion of Turkish citizens living outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but large numbers of supporters showed up nearby to their presidential seat.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan Kurdish protesters were also heard condemning both the policies of Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The one-on-one protests reflected the alienated guest being hailed as a hero by some German Turks and denounced by others as a dictator.
Deptford Road Fault: Rider killed when hit by truck.
A cyclist died in a collision with a lorry in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at 10:15 BTS.
The bus driver stopped and called a doctor, but the young man died instantly.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his family.
There are roadblocks and buses in the area and drivers should be advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in a non-emergency manner.
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security male prison, prison officials said.
An anomaly occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Saturday and was continuous.
Special "Tornado" officers were brought in to deal with the tragic incident, involving eight inmates and a single winged man.
The officer was treated for minor injuries to his face.
A prison spokesman said: "The prison staff have been specially trained to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the police force were hospitalized for their injuries.
We tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will have to turn themselves in to the police and may spend more time in detention.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including those who have committed crimes in some countries.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden had been hospitalized for abuse by inmates.
And in October of last year, a riot police officer was called to jail for a violent riot in which officers were attacked with water balloons.
Hurricane Rosa hit Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a disaster response.
It's unlikely for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's likely early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa spread their power southwest into the desert, creating a flash flood threat.
The National Weather Service declared Monday and Tuesday's disaster time to be in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move through Phoenix on Thursday, approaching late Monday along with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Center reports that there have been only 10 tropical cyclones that have been able to maintain a tropical storm or low-pressure area within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) "Greatly affected Hurricane Katrina within 40 miles of the AZ border".
The latest National Hurricane Center forecast 2-4 inches of rain could reach a maximum of 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas in the southwest in the desert including the central Rockies and the Grat Basin are expected to get 1-2 inches with a possible up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of sudden flooding from the storm's rains, Rosa may be a blessing because of the dry terrain.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some rainfall may be beneficial as the southwest faces drought.
"Going to the United States, drought surveys cover more than 40% of Arizona, which is experiencing drought, ranking second highest in the country", weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will wander to the mainland across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia Mexico and is moving southwest at 12 miles per hour.
The storm was then facing colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, so the storm weakened.
A tropical storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or late afternoon.
Some parts of Mexico may be overflooded.
Total rainfall forecast of 3-6 inches from Baja California in northeastern Sonora is likely to be as high as 10 inches", weathet.com reports.
Rosa then followed northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Sunday, as did Tropical Depression, which followed through Arizona and entered southern Utah late on Sunday.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest and the southwest United States in the desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause sudden and dangerous flooding of desert marine life and the highland terrain of mountainous countries.
Midsomer Naton attack: four killers are wanted.
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were injured in the Exelsior area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
They were taken to the hospital where they remain in the same condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Police are asking for the cooperation of anyone who may have video to see what could happen in the future.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the wrath of the Democratic Party.
Voting for Kavanaugh's speech is a vote to reject the ugly and cruel ways of the Democratic Party", Trump said in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "gotten the wrath, the indignation" of the Democratic Party throughout the negotiation process.
Kavanaugh appeared before Congress on Thursday, strongly denying claims from Christine Blasey Ford that he molested him decades before they were teenagers.
Ford was also a witness at his impeachment trial.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the extent, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the most successful legal ideas of our time that has a record of service", he told a crowd supported by West Virginia.
The president has been vocal about Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of publicity in the election.
Five weeks from the most important election of our lives.
"I'm not doing it for the name, but I'm doing it for real", he said.
That's why I'm everywhere there's a struggle for good unity.
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and hinder".
The primary vote is critical to the balance of power in Congress on Kavanaugh's nomination, expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and death toll is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many washed up on beaches, when an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate on the beaches of Palu on Friday when a wave of up to 6 meters (18 feet) was hurled over the beach at midnight, killing dozens of people.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee and enslave them", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief unit, said in Jakarta.
"The snow wave didn't come by itself, it took away cars, trees, houses and everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the snow wave travelled across the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the coast.
Some even cut down trees to get rid of the bull.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial footage released by the disaster response unit found that several buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were rotted and damaged and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The quake on Tuesday continued to shake the coastal city area on Saturday.
The story of the earthquake caused a stir in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Promotion (BPPT) said the magnitude of the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the magnitude of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geology of the city, which is located at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have increased the size of the snowfall.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said more than a thousand homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were damaged.
The remains of some slaves were discovered under the rubble of the collapsed building, he said, leaving 540 injured and 29 others missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could increase along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, the area known as Donggala, which is near the epicenter.
The communications "have completely gone down without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there", the National Assembly said in a statement, adding that officials and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", is a common saying.
Saturday's unit was widely criticized for not giving notice of a Palu flood, although officials said the wave came within the time of the warning.
In a video that was shared on social media, a man on the roof of a building can be heard screaming loudly warning of a tsunami approaching people in the street below.
Within minutes, the wall of water flooded the coastline, engulfing buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a wildfire that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, and refugees are still in need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city has been reopened for relief purposes and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to a refugee center in Palu on Monday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really sad.
As World Vision officials from Donggala travel to Palu, workers are taking refuge in the shelter of a washing sheet in their office, which they have already experienced a period of devastation, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
It's a very sad story.
Although aid groups have begun to actively take up disaster relief equipment, some claim that foreign aid teams with expertise are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, the provision of foreign capital, equipment and personnel can only begin once a disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It remains a provincial-level deficit", Aulia Arriani said, the spokeswoman for the National Assembly said.
When the government says, "O.K. this is a national disaster", we can open foreign aid but not yet status.
After the earthquake and tsunami hit Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing are still hoping their love will be born as a natural disaster story.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from the toilet.
On Sunday, rescuers helped the woman out of a two-day-long cave with her mother's body separated from him.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national show jumping coach, has been training for two rounds of missing show jumping for the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others are being held at the Roa Roa Hotel, where Mandagi was a student.
"As a brother in the sport of show jumping, I have a feeling of my own", he said.
Gendon said that within hours of news of the Roa Roa hotel breaking in their isolated community, he sent a Whatsapp message to Palu's rival who was meeting at a beach festival.
His message was transmitted with only one yellow label instead of a pair of blue ones.
"I think that means the message was not delivered", he said.
John stole $26,750 while filling an ATM at Newport on Levee.
Jones stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a police press release.
The driver drives to the ATM at the entertainment venue and is ready to send more money. Dennis McCarthy writes in the introduction.
While he was holding the controls from another man, he "ran up from the back of the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of coins to pass on.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not identify the number involved.
Anyone with information about them should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Young rapper changes his name to Ye
Young rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
The change was announced via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Starting from being officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, is nicknamed Ye for a period of time which serves as the name of his eighth album due out in June.
The change will happen before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show which was cancelled due to "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
As with the acronym of his current occupational name, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'", West said earlier this year, speaking on his stage name with Big Boy radio announcer.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's from Kanye, which means one thing, just Ye- just a reflection of our good vibes, our bad vibes, our complexities and everything.
This week reflects who I am".
He was one of the first major rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs is popularly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his retirement from using the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former manager, JAY-Z, did the same with or without the use of labels and large print.
Mexico's AMLO organization vows not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vows to never use military force against civilians as his country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student uprising.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelol Plaza that "never use the military to suppress Mexicans".
Military forces peacefully demonstrated in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by providing a salary to those who are educated and opening up the resources of a more independent state.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have attracted young people to crime.
The U.S. should double its investment in AI.
As China continues to play a bigger role in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in analytics, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and entrepreneur who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Rumors arose after various parts of the US government made announcements with AI, although the US overall still lacked the mechanism to use AI.
In the same sector last year, China presented a plan: to push itself to the top of AI innovation by 2030.
"Increasing the AI standard would be a good start because there are many more countries behind the U.S. and we are pursuing advances in AI", Lee said.
Doubling up on investment could help double the chances of a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence to come in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpower: China, Sill Valley and the New World Oder" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an artificial intelligence operating system that won the top position of American Othello player and he later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee acknowledged past US federal technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be to help define the vision ahead.
Lee said: "Critics in the US often have to work hard to get federal funding.
"China is not importing professionals from abroad but is a private sector", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired celebrities from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies could help the US become more AI-powerful.
"I think the green card should be offered at the AI level automatically", he said.
China's State Council planned an artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation does not fund people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other state organizations do not pay U.S. scientists, but the quality of the work is lower than in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Artificial Intelligence Cooperation, which means that it will have partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Select Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For NSF, it now invests over $100 million a year in AI analytics.
Meanwhile, the US bill that seeks to create a national security committee is not likely to be a major advance on artificial intelligence this month.
Macedonians voted for a referendum to change the name of the country.
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia which has insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has voiced its opposition to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists said the change would erase the identity of most Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanove has said he will not vote in the referendum and won the office with doubts about the protests responding to the upcoming protests by at least 50 percent.
The referendum question: "Can membership of NATO and EU be accepted with a deal from Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, insist it is a price worth paying to join organizations like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the failed Yugoslav states.
"I came here today to celebrate the sovereignty of the country, to educate the new generation in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not in accordance with the law, the members of the delegation are more than willing to follow the results of the vote to be sure.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority vote of the National Assembly.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the output was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to the festival because my hometown and my hometown are in Europe", Gjose Tanevski, 62, a festival official in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev with his wife Zorica and son Dushko go to the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country to make way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and pulling a chair in front of the crowd.
"We join NATO and the EU, but with our leaders we will open doors", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity".
If they don't recognize our country, we can become like China and Russia and part of the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO members will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that most of the incoming will be beneficial because 80 percent of our citizens are the EU and NATO's demands", Zaev said after exercising his right to vote.
He said the secret of "agreeing" would be "what determines our future".
A poll conducted on Monday by the Macedonian Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters voted for the following demonstration.
Another poll by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents would go to the parade on Sunday.
More than 70 percent would agree.
For a successful referendum, 50 percent plus one vote is required.
The failure of the protests would be a reflection of the Western state policy since it was implemented in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City, Brighton's defensive midfielder to the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence to win 2-0 over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it easy for Beira to score his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward receives a pass from the center of the line in the first period.
He ran against Brighton's back three before being run out in the open.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by people in green suits.
He fought one man in the back before doing it several times at the gates of Brighton.
Then he fought and passed the ball to Sterling.
The England striker kicked the ball into the goal to return it to Aguero who, with his right foot, beat the goalkeeper through Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his foot", manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his play in the 55th, 60th minute.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he closed the door at that time".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues a shot at the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball from Brighton's play.
He passed the ball beautifully through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane takes a little time before he passes to Sterling.

Scherzer wants to play volleyball against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's little reason to force a fresh start.
But the game-loving Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but if still affected by the Rockies' championship series, the Los Angeles Dodgers are one game ahead in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least an unexpected berth by beating the Nationals Saturday night 5-2, but still clinched their first-round berth.
Even if we don't play anything, at least we can experience the atmosphere in Denver with the crowds and other teams playing at the highest level of every point I'll meet this year.
Why wouldn't I run?
The Nationals have yet to kick off on Sunday but there are likely reports that Scherzer will be in the situation.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, played in the Opening Game on Thursday and will take a regular break on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump has a protest in West Virginia.
The president refers to the situation at his Supreme Court Circuit that elected Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the Republican rally in the midst of the election.
Everything we do is risky in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big, big thing, I didn't run but I actually ran, which is why I fight for good candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see a very fearsome group of Democratic extremists, you see it happening right now.
And they're very determined to restore power by using a cover-up if necessary, you see the corruption, the corruption.
They don't care who they hurt, who they're fighting for, for power and control, they want power and control, and we're not going to let them go.
He said the Democratic Party had a duty to "resist and obstruct".
"And you see that over the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry and disgusted and disgusting and disgusting".
He referred to the Senate Rules Committee by name, naming seven Democratic lawmakers Dianne Feinstein, who received a roar of displeasure from the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the files?
What?
No, no, I'm waiting for something that's the most beautiful language, the most horrible language I've ever seen.
Workers are no longer a large church.
It can't stand people who say what's on their heart.
When Momentum activists at my local party volunteered to reprimand me, it was hardly a surprise.
Finally, I was the last in line of Labour MPs to realize we were not welcome, as we all speak our hearts.
My fellow congresswoman Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the Trump administration criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy to national security, to Europe is a similar issue that Jeremy did not see with his predecessors, surprisingly.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: "We want it to be well-controlled and effective".
For the past eight years as a local labor unionist, that's exactly what the GC meetings on Friday nights have been.
Sadly today it's not the voice of many conferences and the political promise of "softer and healthier" has long been forgotten if it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not accepted in the Labour Party and that all views are judged to be acceptable to the party leadership.
This happened after Jeremy had just become a leader, as a colleague who I thought shared the same political views began to expect me to turn around and take a position that I disagreed with, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, and it doesn't matter what I say, there's a social media buzz calling for a split, a political neutrality, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
And of course, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because my opinions are often political.
I respect the professionalism and commitment of those colleagues who are exposed to the daily flow of sexist or racist language but never ashamed.
One of the most frustrating aspects of politics in this era is the level of power that has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are not a broad church and that all the rules of "uncertainty" or changing the rules of the election are getting more narrow.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years that has made me go against the vote ban and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what you want to do when you're playing politics.
Since I joined the labour movement 32 years ago as a schoolboy challenged by the Thatcher government's indifference to throwing my extensive school classroom to the ground, I have sought better public services for those who really need them, whether as a local ambassador or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is in any way concerned about my policy stance and the extent of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those of you who are promoting Monday's resolution, let's just say that when the country is rushing to Brexit to destroy our homes, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But one message I have not really for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my representatives whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that the threat of election in any number of ways or political threats will not stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: No one can stop Ayr from going to the top
A second attempt could have undid the final result but there is no doubt Ayr will win Tennent's Premiership in a grand final today.
They are now at the top of the table as the only undefeated side out of ten teams.
In the end, it was a defense that was more than their chances running home and Coach Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've done our game testing so far and we're not afraid of anyone so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Give Ayr credit, they took their chances better than I did".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, delivered by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Rory Hughes, Scotland's ton, knocked him out of the game with Warrior leading, allowing Melrose to tell with the numbers and Jason Baggot to take a no-show attempt.
Climo took the lead with Ayr on a penalty earlier in the half, he scored from a single-player conversion attempt to make it 17-5 to Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose started the half well and Patrick Anderson's effort, sending Baggot to the half, cut the lead to five.
Then came a badly injured time-out to Ruaridh Lnott, who was sent off but recovered, Ayr rising to the front through the opposition of Stafford McDowall, replaced by Climo.
Ayr retained his place with Tony Blair Macpherson again receiving a yellow card, Melrose paid an additional fee to Bruce Colvine who was still unrepentant at the end of the intense stress.
The home side came back, and when Struan Hutchinson took the yellow card from the deal with Climo without a ball, from the penalty spot MacPherson went to bat behind Ayr Maul who was approaching.
Climo sent, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe collected a penalty kick from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry out to the side for a fifth-place finish.
The Star Games is still a new career in the restaurant industry.
Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the service industry after discovering he's running for a position as a licensed restaurant manager.
The 56-year-old actor was cast as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC soap opera, which he wrote and co-starred in with his long-time pen pal Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming series 9 would be the final chapter in the show's life and it appears that Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although the Scottish Sun said Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".

"Bolivia has a dynamic, spirit of unity and peace and hopes for a positive outcome", said Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the World Court trial on big screens across the country, hoping the court in The Hague will agree with Bolivia's demand that after decades of negotiations, the country must negotiate an independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous president who faces a bitter battle for re-election next year, is also facing a massive trial on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he declared in late August.
But some critics believe that the court will not be able to decide in favor of Bolivia and that it will make little difference if it does".
The UN in the Netherlands has no authority to award the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The World Court's hearing comes just six months after the last hearing of the case, which proved to be unsuccessful, said Paz Zárate, Chilean international lawyer.
And the far-reaching force of Bolivia's cause, four years ago, could cause another problem.
"The issue of access to the sea is being solved by the Bolivian government now", Zárate said.
He suggested that Morales's rhetoric had attracted the support of the rest of Chile.
Sometimes Bolivia and Chile will have to have a point to talk about again, but it will be very difficult to talk about it now.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was faster than usual.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new chapter of relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of conflicts of common interest", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using his intelligence to navigate a political dilemma.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The trial is an opportunity to show that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless the United States can be trusted.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would not denuclearize first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the pledge made during the Singapore Leaders' Summit between the leaders of the twin countries.
His views are on the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume negotiations on a halted nuclear test more than three months after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un withdrew from Singapore.
Ri said the "dream pipe" that remains and the US opposition to a Korean War ceasefire would force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang before making a major arms move.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another leaders' summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about lifting the curfew, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump leaders' summit.
A Paris fashion show showcases the latest in a huge collection of clothes on the High Street near you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection or block out the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a large, bizarre collection for their SS19 collection on the sidewalk, which made Paris Fashion Week a sensation.
The low-top hat was removed from Instagram this summer, and these designers have been posting their eye-catching designs on the fashion show.
The outstanding dress by Valentino is an egg-colored hat decorated with a wide feather like a bird's nest that protrudes from her head.
Other large accessories include a pear-shaped cotton ball, a special hat and even a nut, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a bizarre Halloween mask.
The multi-colored mask has a mouth-squeezing and more Hannibal Lecter-like look than high-tech cutting art.
One of the creatures looked like a submarine with a water feature and glasses, while the other looked like a melting pot.
And if you're still in the big fashion statement, you're in luck.
Modern observers predict that large hoods can be worn along the high street near you.
The big hat became popular following 'La Bomba', the 2-foot wide-brimmed hat seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat on the back of the used hat was not high enough and was shared on social media, which led to other big fashion innovations such as the sandbags that were as big as the swimsuit samples that were packed in them.
A pink burnt palm tray decorated with a palm tree and featuring a white paper handle was featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see the big-box and big-box bags coming to high street for the summer next year because the designers have made a huge impact it can be hard to ignore the huge demand for jewellery.
John Edward: A vital advisor to the citizens of the world.
Scottish private schools maintain a record of academic excellence and this continues in 2018 alongside a series of other outstanding achievements that are only strengthened by individual success and partnerships in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With a growing number of 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As a field of study that can be specifically designed and implemented in school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will go into his head.
If you talk to them in their own language, it goes to their heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the last results of this year's survey, we can see that languages ranked high on the consonant scale with the highest pass rates among private schools.
68 percent of all students who study foreign languages get A or above.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students received A or above in Middle Chinese, while 72 percent of German, 69 percent of French, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Now languages as electives are being put in the same category as STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects in private school curricula and so on.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Authority found that of the reasons employers gave for the difficulty in hiring candidates for vacant positions, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
With job opportunities that require more languages, these skills are important in the age of globalization.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will be stuck with this skill for the rest of their lives.
The ability to communicate in a coordinated manner with people from abroad will allow people to speak in multiple languages automatically before the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% are not fluent enough in a foreign language to create a conversation, and French is the only language used in the top two, 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important for kids today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance at meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will have a different language of instruction.
Many schools will focus on more modern, classical languages, while others will teach languages considered to be of major importance for the UK by 2020, such as Central Chinese or Japanese.
Whether you are interested in it or not, your child will have a variety of languages to choose from in a private school with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing learning environments that prepare children and their families with the skills they need no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied now, in the global business environment that language remains of great importance to the future of the country so this will have to be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be considered as "techniques of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it.
Jonh Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron is opening for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But when it comes to when he will play, it is not yet set.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website that it's going to be more than one and less than 48.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell speculated that James might be playing in a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't want to have a preseason game during this time to fully prepare myself", he said.
The film is based on the true story of the first man to fly a plane to the moon.
President Donald Trump begins his campaign speech tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of a planned five speeches next week, including a stop-gap at various sponsors including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a standing vote already in place for his choice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in which Republicans risk losing control of the House when the polls close in November.
What time is it tonight at the West Virginia River Fishing Fair, and how can you watch it online?
The Wheeling, West Virginia, city of the river is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the world premiere of the show live on YouTube below.
Trump may be referring to this week's rally for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained by sexual misconduct allegations with a Senate vote upholding a stay of up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the speech's plot is to help the Republicans face the November election with some additional support.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that five speeches next week will focus on "volunteers and strong supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the large support base they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of the House is crucial to your presidency as the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter a complicated campaign season", a Trump spokesman, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's game could bring in fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw press coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in the past month that Trump has landed in West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come down and try to manipulate a poll on him", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows determination to keep up its hopes for Sunday singles
After three singles sets, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The broad, broad, bell-shaped fruits of the kinetic energy are a completely new sporting concept, but one that the players really believe in and no more than races like these.
So they're going to say, where's the momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I guess we're running low on momentum", Jordan Spieth said as he walked out for the day.
The European side equalised, of course, a four-point lead with 12 more in play.
The Americans, Spieth said, felt they had a little leafy wind and a lot of energy for them, at least Spieth's toy form and Justin Thomas's, who played together all day and each took three out of four shots.
Spieth throws the baby from the cradle to the grave and is leading by example.
The sound of those cheers was heard as his round continued, a crucial knock to win the game four times as he and Thomas were two-down two laps later.
His knockout in the 15-game win against them received similar votes, which tells you that he believes the U.S. team is not out of the tournament.
"You get into real depth and worry about your own race", Spieth said.
It's all these players, each one of them, that's gone now.
18 Points to score.
The top scorers over Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champions.
It's a European rare breed, but a happy couple is four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to bogey on Saturday night, but they also skipped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and returned on Friday morning.
That's the continuation and the way their energy will flow to and from the excited crowd that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that no more drunken players will be able to claim a European victory when West passes Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Well, they were both in different caves at the same time.
The talk of European peace is not yet happy.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hosted Sergio Garcia, the fourth Bishop of the morning, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
One four and two double-doubles on the first nine holes or the first nine holes drove the Spaniard and the Swede into the hole they never got close to dancing out.
Even on the Sabbath, no one helps you to get out of your well.
Four kids and four are a catch to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and how the strategy can now change.
Europe played better as a team and were a key lead into the final, but the four-man draw also showed that the United States team still showed a willingness to fight, especially as the Stateside remained in doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 in the final Ryder Cup
Europe will have a better chance of making it to the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming up from Saturday's four-man and four-man draws with the United States leading 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's partnership was inspired by the two-time defending champion Tiger Woods trying to climb the ladder at Le Golf National four times.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, fighting to keep the lead they had lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, against the American side who had been beaten in the morning four, won 3-1.
The United States had a four-point lead, two wins, but they couldn't make up for what was missing.
Jim Furyk's side needed a draw from Saturday's 12 games to keep it going.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four straight draws while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the weekend's sensation, were only the second pair to win four draws since their opening four in Ryder Cup history.
With Woods and Patrick Reed tied at four, they were then able to match Woods and new American hand Bryson Dechambeau's winning streak by adding 5&4.
Woods, who pitched himself two innings on Saturday showing his ultimate explosion coming off a sometimes-black, now has lost 19 of his 29 innings in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had taken a four-child break in the morning, returned to pair up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to become 2&1 winner over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have it their own way, despite a happy, wild day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the stage for the United States with two points on Saturday.
They beat Jon Rahm's 2&1 North and Ian Poulter's junior Spain on fourballs to come back from a 4&3 loss to Poulter and Rory McIlroy on four at the opening two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history that a team has come back from a four-game deficit to go to the Notting Hill, although Furyk's side has always needed a single to keep the lead.
After being second best for two days, however, the Sunday night debate seemed to be over them.
North Korea says there is 'no way' to unilaterally denuclearize without confidence
North Korea's foreign ministry told the United Nations on Saturday that continued escalation is increasing mistrust of the United States and there is no way the country would unilaterally denuclearize itself under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had used "important goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, moving nuclear test sites and pledging non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any consistent response from the United States", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we will disarm ourselves unilaterally".
While Ri spoke to the already-concerned North Korean about Washington's opposition to a "temporary" approach to nuclear weapons under which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually progresses, his statement underscored the importance of not eliminating a single nuclear weapon from the hands of the United States as it has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to move toward "the denuclearization of Korea" as Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must first eliminate its own nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for maximum foreign pressure on North Korea.
"The United States stands for 'nuclear deterrence first' and has increased pressure by forcing to achieve their goals in the form of sanctions and even opposition to 'end wars,'" Ri said.
"The idea that power can make us bend our knees is the impossible dream of people who don't care about us.
But the problem is that the continuing violence is only deepening our mistrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that U.S. leaders highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the side to the nuclear issue is South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear issue of North Korea would not come to such a situation".
However, Ri's tone of speech was markedly different from last year, when he addressed the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after the "President of Evil" Trump called Kim "a man of sorrows" in a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who has threatened to "destroy North Korea completely", extended his praise to Kim for his courageous move to denuclearize, but said more had to be done and tensions remained until North Korea reached a nuclear port.
On Wednesday, Trudeau said he had no time frame for this, saying: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Beijing for the steps taken.
Nevertheless, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The use of the Security Council's powers must continue vigorously and without fail until we are convinced that nuclear deterrence has been checked, finally, all of it".
The Security Council has consistently supported the use of force against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for its nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Beijing again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was unlikely to be very successful.
He left Seoul in July, saying he had made progress, only for North Korea, in his few hours to create "a demand like a bald head".
North Korea pledged at a Moon summit this month to sell its nuclear weapons and development facilities if the United States took "consistent measures".
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and moved to reestablish relations with Washington.
A Harvard graduate student takes a course in proper rest
One of the new courses at Harvard University this year is to get graduate students of Massachusetts enough sleep to combat the male culture of studying through 'all-night study' with caffeine.
One study found that professors at one of the world's top universities tend to be foolish when it comes to the most basic of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and a consultant at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed what he believes to be the first course of its kind in the United States.
You were inspired to start the course after talking about the effects of sleep on learning.
'At the end of it, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I only being taught this now, when I am in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of good sleep habits for academic and athletic performance, as well as how to improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief of health services, said the university decided to recommend the course after finding that students were sleeping a lot on weekdays.
The course, which lasts several hours, includes a series of interactive worksheets.
In one section is a picture of a living room in the hall, where the teachers go to get coffee, cloths, coaches, and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and lights, and the physical effects are affected by insufficient sleep and the importance of time in daily activities.
In another section, participants were told how sleep can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, depression, and cancer.
The school district map with interactive audio helps guides the students in their daily activities.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of the teacher overnight.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", adds Professor Czeisler.
He says that a culture of 'all-night reading' is still alive, with more modern technology and increased pressure on teachers, meaning sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough quality sleep is a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and resentment, he says, but also to avoid weight gain because sleep brings the brain into a state of restlessness, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physics major, helped Professor Czeisler design a course when he joined one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard University.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue courses across the university system.
He hopes that the next step will tell students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
Dr. Czeisler advised students to consider setting an alarm clock or bedtime warning, as well as waking up at a certain time, and to be alert to the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can take your self-image from a state of discomfort to a state of insomnia.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gate, Gerrard's men's team
Rangers suffered a setback in the Blue Day game when Dolly Menga's shot sent Steven Gerrard's side down 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox were on the verge of their first victory since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second injury in the 18th minute as manager to relieve his side of eight defeats to Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga was tied at seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' shot in the move was unlikely to be permanent.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and just behind Hibernian just behind the loser.
And there could be another storefront problem for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to undergo treatment for a head wound after an apparent misfiring.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances, which put Ayr into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt goes with the same Livi 11 that drew one from Hearts last week and he's going to be pleased with the way his set came out that he's been hitting his opponent's side every time he comes back.
The Rangers may have more balls, but Livingston has more balls than they do.
They should have scored just two minutes when Menga's first out sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's door, but his big-time centre of gravity opened up.
Keaghan Jacobs's kickoff was then heavily injured by captain Craig Halkett, but his back-up Alan Lithgow was able to make a wide substitution in the back-row.
The Rangers were in control but looked more hopeful than confident about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty in the fifteen-minute arrest because of his clash with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian players' protest.
Rangers scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only defended by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's light attack.
While the 34th-minute opening of Leviticus may have resisted continuing the play, no one can deny that they deserved it for their single offering.
Once again the Rangers failed to protect Jacobs's table.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson, who was still calm, and chose to finish the manga easily.
Gerrard was sent off at half-time when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and almost all of the substitutions came immediately when the pitcher was injured in Morelos, but Kelly jumped from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to entice fans to play the game they really loved, with Lithgow and Halkett always in control.
Holt's side could have pulled them out in the final, but McGregor was determined to defeat Jacobs before Lithgow took the lead out of the corner.
Rangers traded Glenn Middleton for a penalty when he got involved with the Jacobs, but again Thompson was not interested.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and counting . . . the day the world-famous physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring color diffraction, the latter of which led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
The Geiger counter has become a popular cultural reference, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where stars are seen as unlikely to be the same as the famous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "The Geiger counter, used to detect unstable minerals like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the sound of the atoms' effects emitted by the diffusion of light in the metal".
"It's happening right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the miracle that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines may teach the immune system to 'see' the virus
New cancer vaccines can teach immune systems to spot and kill viruses
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize pathogens as part of treatment
The treatment is based on the principle that the immune system is the body's first line of defense against infection.
They can then see the protein that is common to many cancers and then be injected again.
Trial vaccines are showing promising results in many types of cancer patients.
One woman who received treatment with a vaccine, which teaches her to overcome a malignant immune system, found that her ovarian cancer disappeared after more than 18 months.
The method involves isolating the immune cells from the patients, changing them in the laboratory so they can 'see' a common protein with many cancers called HER2 and then inject it back in.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", says Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "drives the spread of many cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar technique of removing the immune cells from patients and "educating" them on how to target the cancer cells has been done in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West began to speak out about his fan base, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was hanged in his studio during a Saturday night recess after a performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would be running in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a giant American-made hat, he spoke harshly of Democrat and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So a lot of times I'm around white people and they say, 'How can you love a man who's racist and racist?'
Hey, if I was worried about racism and racial discrimination, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began with Matt Damon's performance as Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not released, West's graphic memoir was posted online by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to emulate West with the post.
In addition, West continued to tell the audience that he was being bullied in the dressing room about the device on his head.
"They harassed me in the isolation room.
They said, 'Don't go out without your hat on.'
They persecuted me!
And then they say I'm in a coma", he said, according to the Washington Post.
West goes on to say: "Do you want to see the end?" saying he's going to "put on my suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
"I have a lot of love for you.
His comments made the audience laugh at least twice and the cast members of SNL were stunned, with one of them giving a speech to the audience, Variety reports: "The whole studio feels quiet".
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose longtime fan, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has made a lot of people laugh with his performance of I Love It, disguised as Perry Bottle.
West was supported by TPUSA's head of conservatism, Candace Turner, who said: "To one of the bravest minds: Thank you for standing up for the people".
But host Karen Hunter said West "was who he was and that was the most amazing thing" in a simple way.
"But I choose not to reward certain people (by buying his music or his uniform or by supporting his "art") who I believe are embracing and encouraging outlets that are harmful to my community.
He was free.
We have too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "Kanye West as he is officially known".
He is not the first artist to change their name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the former rapper changed his name to a pseudonym and the artist was then known as Prince.
The charges of attempted robbery at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
He is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the state prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington thinks he's letting go of his manly suspicions
Kit Harington is best known for his swordplay role as Jon Snow in the HBO horror-thriller series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has released a traditional version of the priest, saying that such a role on screen means that young people often feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture's culture chief, Kit said he believes 'something's wrong' and asked questions about how to deal with the problem of male skepticism in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels 'too heavy' about talking about problems.
'I feel so heavy on my personal name right now, what's wrong with being a man?' he says.
'What have we taught the men when they grow up to face the problems we see today?'
Kit believes that the telephone may be partly responsible for the rise of male skepticism thanks to its authentic masculine identity.
He continued: 'What is natural and what is taught?
What about the TV and street news that make young people feel that they must be on the side of masculinity?
I think that's one of the really big questions of our time, how do we change that?
'Because there is clearly something wrong with the young man.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do anything before or after Game of Thrones when the book came out the following summer, saying he was 'done with the battlefield and the horses'.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a tanner and his brother, who is a businessman.
The actor recently revealed that he is considering meeting his wife Rose to make the best of what's to come from Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife at this show, so in that way it gives me a permanent family and my life away from here,' he says.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning television series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has predicted that the number of its own citizens living with HIV and AIDS will increase by 14%.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been tested.
There were 40,000 new cases reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
Almost all of the new cases are sexually transmitted, making a difference from the old.
But then, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan city.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but LGBT preferences are said to be widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying a woman.
Many of the genetic diseases that come from contraceptive use are not confined to these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatments as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP senator's spy is corrupt, blasting 'dangerous lies' and 'compassion theory'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters named an allegation on Saturday that one of her staffers posted the personal information of a U.S. Republican senator on the legislature's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claim was being backed up by experts and a website of the "Special Right Wing".
"Lies, lies and disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided by the report included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The scandal erupted shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Anonymous websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the post's compromised IP address was linked to Waters' office and leaked the details of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"The unsubstantiated allegations are all lies and obviously false", Waters continued.
"My employees, whose privacy, personal information and security are being compromised by false and untrue allegations, cannot be held responsible for this leak.
The accusations are baseless, all false and obvious".
Waters' statement prompted a quick online investigation, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is disgraceful", wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she has no ambition to be a member of Congress.
When people are accused of something they did not do, they get angry.
They must not be challenged.
They should not question the accusers' reasons.
They need to be quiet and peaceful".
Fleischer has drawn comparisons between Waters's behavior and that of Democrat Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too mean during Thursday's ruling.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to keep Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate agencies and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the culprits are exposed", she continued, "and so they will be held legally accountable for their actions that have caused harm and harm to any and all of my employees".
The book was published in the United States on December 15, 1921.
It is now customary to find the importance of Brexit in a new paper with a British slant and see that this cannot be applied to this revival of the Johnny English stock market monopoly, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was quickly revived in 2011 with the rebirth of Johnny English.
Is the glass in the glass going to be a disgrace to the subject of the garbage we're clearly in as a new export opportunity?
To some extent, Johnny English, the eye-catcher, had his license to paint things that had been renewed a second time - that of a sign more than anything else that he was creating a broad-based logo designed for a non-English-speaking area to see the paper.
He is of course a representative of Bob, who despite his bizarre treatment of the water spray, has a small Clouseau, Mr Bean's life and a dollop of thanks that was featured as the theme song for the Chariots of Fire opening ceremony at the London 2012 Olympics.
He also initially relied on the traveler and the mysterious alien Atkinson when playing in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, causing a commotion in his wake.
There was one or two very important events on this recent JE trip.
I like Johnny English going into the helicopter while he's hiding in the middle of a robbery and the helicopter leaves briefly wrapped around his hat.
Atkinson's gift for real humor is on display, but humor feels drained and subtly phony, especially since "real" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently feature humor.
The joke feels like it's more expanded than it is in adults, and to me Johnny English's strange, unconventional reasoning is not as creative and focused as Atkinson's book-closing on Bean.
The main reason for this has been that the Kingdom has been in serious trouble for many years.
A cyber hacker hacked into the top secret network of British intelligence, exposing the UK intelligence services' personal information on the ground, to make the unit perform a disastrous task - a minor embarrassment for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final nail in the coffin for the Prime Minister, who is a handsome, combative individual, experiencing the breakdown of all political disfavor: Emma Thompson does the best with these four Teresa-May characters but has little in the way of roles to work with.
Her secret counsel informed her that since the ever-present secret had been destroyed, she would have to remove some of the people from the command.
And that means ignoring Johnny English himself, who now works as a school principal in some of the most prestigious institutions, but giving extra lessons on how to record would be a secret job: some good silence here, because English offers a secret school of rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for a quick performance and reunites with long-injured former tight end Bough, reprised by Ben Miller.
Bough, now a married man, is faced with a submarine captain, a good-for-nothing role in which Vicki Pepperdine narrowly escapes death.
Batman and Robin are thus given the heavy lifting to get Her Majesty's Secret Service back on the action, with an encounter with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful girlfriend Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being lured into a circle of high-tech economists who claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their high-profile escape attempt: they posed as robbers, set fire to a French restaurant, lit a light on the roof; they created a riot by robbing the Volta's boat; and English caused a stir as he tried to use a fake earpiece to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops were obviously pushed out for that last episode, but being friendly and exciting as it was, there was a little kid's TV behind the whole thing.
The Bible says: "The eyes of the blind one will be opened, and the ears of the deaf one will be unstopped".
And as with other Johnny English books I can't help but wonder: Couldn't the British paper industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that could truly do justice to his blessings?
Labour denies that it is promising Britons a four-day workweek but five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a basic plan that would see Britons work four days - but get paid five.
The party reportedly demanded that the company's head pass on the AI-enabled disruption to employees by giving them a special day off.
It would see the employee have three weekends, but still get the same pay.
The idea, the source said, would "fit in" with the economy and the party's plan to isolate the country to the benefit of workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was adopted by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to adjust to the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'The New Year's resolution is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a desire that is consistent with the Party's strategy to rebalance the economy in the interests of workers as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, now the wish has not been fully accepted by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not a party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow chairman John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to elaborate on his vision for economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was destined to wrest back power from "unknown directors" and "extreme profiteers" at the utility company.
The shadow government's plan also means current shareholders in the water company may not get all their shares back because the Labour government can make a 'takeover' on the basis of recognised wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the board and create an Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of the company's equity to employees, who stand to pocket up to £500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case could not change their mind.
The FBI investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised questions about whether the agents' findings could persuade any Republican Senators to rally their support.
In an interview with Sunday's "60 Minutes", reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy is usually more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to go into the garden, I said, 'I've already dated Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the accusation came out, and I said, 'Did you do it?'
He was innocent, determined, and unquestioning".
However, Graham's vote rule suggests that the penalty is difficult to achieve.
"My heart goes out to Brett Kavanaugh and it will be a blast", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it in a very strong way", Graham added, citing Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names can't verify it.
He was 36 years old.
I see nothing new".
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
New York City is hosting the Global Citizen Festival this weekend, an annual concert featuring a number of talented performers and an equally passionate theme; the end of poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create a memorial to the event's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get free admission to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers must complete a number of tasks or "processes", such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, telephoning, or other meaningful means to help build memories of their goal of ending poverty.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded in 12 years to achieve its goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free advertising a genuine way to encourage people to call for action or another case of "clicktivism", where people feel they are making a difference by singing a song online or posting a message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters, pushing for various goals.
It says that these actions have helped motivate world leaders to make more than $37 billion in pledges and policies that are set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group claimed that 390 pledges and forecasts resulted from its own operations, at least $10 billion of which had been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the recently guaranteed funds have directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
Some notable commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementing partnership that has pledged to "help children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's hunger after more than 4,700 attacks from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice or under-nutrition a story in the media", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live broadcast in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 campaigns calling for the U.K. to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition programme that will reach 5 million women and children with commercial assistance.
In response to a frequently asked question on his website, "What makes you think we can really end poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, and sometimes we will fail and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances shown at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US Navy could use the "interference" to block Russian energy exports - Interior Ministry
"If necessary", Washington could deploy its own navy to protect the power of market forces, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as claimed by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore a new energy market.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they need to be the head of the force as they do in Eastern Europe, Central Southern Europe", he reported.
And according to officials, there are many ways and many ways to handle it.
"With our navy, the United States has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary to close, to ensure that their forces do not go to market", he said.
Zinke told an audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, seeing that they have similar capabilities.
"More or less, the economic options to Iran and Russia are stagnant and are testing oil", he said, referring to Russia as a "cheating horse" with an oil-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is in talks to support exporting its own liquefied natural gas to Europe, rather than Russia, a more affordable option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "king of Moscow".
Moscow stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which was set up to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven by simple economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we are changing the view that force cannot be a tool to use pressure and therefore consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance predicted dire consequences for Germany, which reiterated its own commitment to the program.
Germany's leading trade union, the Bund of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the European Energy Charter and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when third countries interfere with our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of the Energy Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will watch the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at the presidential race after the midterm elections.
While at the Central Assembly Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted that she would consider applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that one with women in the top spot", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider running for president".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump in the middle of the convention center, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my core about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren spoke out in her trial against Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we want an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large group of her eligible voters did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters "probably" say a senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent support such a resignation.
A poll of public opinion showed increased support for retirement by Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of retirement and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats who have discussed their 2020 retirement include former Vice President Joe Biden and former Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in February, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin claims PTSD from Track Palin at a speech by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through is coming back, I can relate to other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have come back from", she told an audience at a speech for the river in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "silent in the room", and said of his son and other veterans, "They come back little different, they come back feeling better, they come back wondering if there's that respect for what it is that their soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given back to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, interfering with domestic violence reporting and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. Supporting the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing cold or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories filed a companion court brief on Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers challenging the ban, NBC News reported.
Jody's full name is in Grace v. The complaint the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal government was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his gang member's son" had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum offer on July 20.
She was confined in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, because those countries face common problems with cold and internal violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy updates the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals agreement that allows immigrants to apply for asylum without a violent agent.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that New Jersey "is not subject to decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the facts and particular circumstances of the claim, and such a bar association violates that principle", the court's amicus brief said.
Lawyers further argued in the brief that Norway's denial of immigration is detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying they may become a conduit and "provide the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the June crackdown.
"Asylum is available to those who have fled their homeland due to persecution or fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", the Assembly said in its June 11 declaration.
Refuge does not mean that all the problems that people face every day around the world will be solved, even the worst ones.
Rescue efforts in Palu are in a state of despair as the death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation worsened.
"It feels so stressful", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, giving warmth to her leper-like baby boy in a refugee camp in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, a body is brought in by a hospital bus.
Clean water is scarce".
I saw residents returning home with their losses, picking through the dirt, trying to grab whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized as a result of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and arm, are staying outside Paris' military hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to the ongoing strong earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how the quake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There is no time to save us.
I was pushed against the wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe".
The US accuses China of 'cold' with 'traffic ads'
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper urging mutual benefit from China-U.S. trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election marks what US officials told Reuters as a new step in a growing campaign by Washington to increase pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to launch campaigns to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in the form of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariff response at the start of the trade war was designed to counter exporters in several states, such as Iowa, that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday op-ed in the Des Moines Register, "China is now doubling the traffic by advertising in our own free newspapers".
"In its own propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's rich culture of free speech and free press by placing advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the street newsstand here in Beijing, you will find limited opposition and no real reflection of the different views that Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic cycle, which is still under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Members of the Republican Party are divided over women voters ahead of the midterm elections with the lavishness of Kavanaugh, the analyst warns.
With many prominent Republicans still waiting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual harassment allegations, analysts have warned they will see consequences, especially from women, in the run-up to the upcoming midterm elections.
The mood around this is very high and most Republicans are on record saying they want a head start on the vote.
"The world is a dangerous place", says Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected last-minute pressure from Arizona Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for an FBI investigation would be enough to silence angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior counselor and national spokeswoman for the MovOn group, said on Friday, according to The Washington Post.
On Saturday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested on the Senate floor as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the presence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and drive for democracy is going out the window", Stu Rothenberg, a moderate political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's too high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and young voters 18 to 29 years old, while those who dislike the president tend not to vote".
Even before Ford's testimony detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested the consequences could follow if Republicans pushed further with the confirmation.
"This has become a turbulent time for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier in the week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is put down, it's about how the Republicans handled this and how they handled her", Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news outlet.
However, it is sometimes seen that Americans are divided over who believes in following the Ford and Kavanaugh gifts, with minor interference.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents either really or probably believe Ford's words, while 35 percent said they really or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might lie or lie in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh molested her while she was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the nominee exposed his male genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying medicine at Yale in the 1980s.
The creators of the World Wide Web plan to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology company, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee also said that the Internet behind Inrupt is "taking over the world".
"We have to do it now", he says at the beginning.
"It was a historic event".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal information store" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, routines, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about a private online store is that it is up to all users who have access to what kind of information.
The organization calls it "personal empowerment through information".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea for Inrupt is for the company to bring the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Now the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security software brought by IBM, some contracted developers on projects and a group of volunteer hackers.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to create apps from their own community hub using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team didn't talk about "Facebook and Google about bringing all the changes into a place where all their business models are put head and tail across the board.
"We didn't ask their permission".
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide a single commercial and ecosystem to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new Web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee turned the Internet on its head when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain the founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the web and open data institute's founders.
"I would have a lot of hope for this next generation of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A WW1 Victoria Cross recipient
Only a Church of England knight would win the Victoria Cross during World War I when the hero was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot dead four days later and he never knew he had received the British Army's highest honour.
The monument was unveiled by his two grandparents at Ward's Square in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "the ultimate secret" that the painting would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award ceremony.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick mud and under heavy fire from the field and cannon".
He then rushed up to the female fighter and with "great courage" took the lead before he shot the gun into the dark arena using a single shot and struck three times in the liberation.
On October 4, 1918, Colonel Van was killed by German guns - just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I couldn't do but something I believed in".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the ceremony, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the Brotherhood movement", adding: "The courage of the true priest is being demonstrated by the support that will be received by many".
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, they've got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine watching this, you don't sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206 that was put on hold just to keep ignoring the original show.
The San Jose commercial is 13 minutes long, including six minutes in the main card and is being shown live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, Sir Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, the UK audience was left shocked when the taping was changed to a Peppa Pig cartoon.
Some people become depressed after staying up late into the night, especially for the night.
A Twitter fan described the adaptation as a "kind of a teapot".
"It's government policy at 6 a.m. that content is inappropriate, so they have to change to kids shows", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the airing of the program.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to bring in UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the back-up, I think we might be able to fix it", Coker said.
"But it is only the sixth hour of the week, and we cannot go out until the day of the week, because it is the day of the week.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it changed, there were messages back and they were all unfriendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it's not, it's a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to cut it down to five minutes to six minutes like we normally do, and we've tried to overdo it with the guys, and we're already past the point.
It is a shameful situation".
Tom Daley feels 'deficient' in his sexual character
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he entered high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about his rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less focused on winning the Olympics.
The host of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of illness.
Appearing as a villain in Laverne's first episode, Daley says that he feels "less than" everyone else growing up because "it's not as socially acceptable as a boy or a girl".
He says: "To this day, those feelings of less and less and different emotions are real things that give me the strength and vigor to succeed".
He needed to prove he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally met about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT publicist and used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to end the criminalization of homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - U.S. leathermaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "touched me with surprise".
Daley married Oscar winner, who is his twin brother 20 years ago, but he says age gaps have never been an issue.
"When you've been through so much at such a young age" - he took part in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it's hard to find someone his age who has similar abilities, both high and low.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "entire perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be about 'I want to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what, there's something bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be on the front lines.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be in front of me,'" he says.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he died that I finally realized he couldn't win", he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew what I had dreamed of my whole life - to jump in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he says.
It also inspired his first song selection, Proud by Heather Small, which sent him to the Olympic Games and also made him a star.

Mickelson was arrested while sitting in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays 47th in his Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to his form to avoid a disappointing performance.
Mickelson, playing in the 12th annual statistical bi-annual, was seated with Jim Furyk for four and four Saturdays.
Rather than being the center of the action, as he prefers to be in the United States, his five-time major champion split his time between being the head of the race and continuing his game on the sidelines in the hope of resolving what was interfering with him.
Never having achieved the utmost integrity of a batsman even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in perfect shape for the difficult Le Golf National, where long-distance hardball is regularly penalized.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth minute on Sunday, faces defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four shots down from a 12-point lead, come off to a strong start, Mickelson's score could prove crucial.
Furyk shows confidence in his people, not that he can talk much anymore.
"He understood all the roles he had today, leaned behind me one beat and took his arm to me and he said he would be ready the next day", Furyk said.
"He was very confident.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's been inducted into many of those teams in the past and this week.
I probably don't remember him playing for two seconds.
I'm more of a visionary, but that's the way it turned out and that's the way we think we should go.
He wanted to go there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson would surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that would never match the height of his personal best.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven, although Furyk said his arrival brought some unwanted things to the team.
"He was funny, he was colorful, he was funny, he liked to make fun of people and he was a great presence in the team room", he explains.
"I think the young player has a sense of humor with him, too, and this week will see a sense of humor.
He gives more than he plays".
With the European team, Thomas Bjorn knew that many of the leaders could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, with the European team, knew from experience that a lot of leading up to the final round in the Ryder Cup could easily turn into a very uncomfortable move.
The Danes made their first appearance at the 1997 tournament in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros was the five-point leader against North America but also crossed the line just to beat the hosts by a final score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're too far ahead at Valderrama; we're too far ahead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and we're too far behind at Valderrama, where we won, but that's it", Bjorn said, showing a photo, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You'll have a full day.
Get out there and do the right thing.
This isn't over until you paint it on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus is.
I've said it all, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know what's going on on the other side, the best players in the world".
Pleased with what his players did in a difficult stadium, Bjorn added: "I can't go through this alone.
The next day was a different person.
The next day is the result of the individual coming out and that's a different thing to do.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there by yourself, you're testing your own abilities as a fighter.
That's the message you have to give to the players, make yourself better the next day.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and play his best".
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk would find his players to play individually better than they would play as a pair, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who drew three out of four draws.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those great final outcomes, being part of the team that won in Brookline before finishing with a loss because Europe had established a "Medinah Mission".
"I remember every one of its incantations", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, with the 1999 Ton, had gathered his players for the final.
"We have another 12-minute key, but you want to get down to the early start like you see in Brookline, like you see in Medina.
When the force is moving in the opposite direction, it creates more pressure in those centers.
We set our players up and we put the players out in the way we feel they should be, you know, trying to do something big the next day".
Thomas was hired to try to lead the fight back and face Rory McIlroy in the top of the standings, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter on the other European side in the top half of the standings.
"I go with this group of players in this lineup because I think it takes the way through everything", Bjorn says in his selection of the singles.
The German battleship was again moved
The German Navy's newest warship was supposed to be delivered in 2014 to replace an old Cold War-era battleship, but it won't be there until at least next year due to faulty procedures and cost overruns, local media reports.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper quoted a spokesman for the force as saying.
The ship was supposed to enter service in 2014, but after delivery problems prevented the completion of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class battleships.
Understand that they will highlight powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic reduction.
Another important point is the longer maintenance period - it should be possible to disembark the newest warship from home port for two years.
However, speaking for Germany on the foreign power project, the continued delays mean the submarine will be obsolete by the time it enters service, Die Zeit said.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cite a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that render the ship useless if left unattended in combat.
The lack of software was particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would be operated by a crew of 120 officers - only half the manpower of the older Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ships are clearly overweight, which reduces operational efficiency and limits the fleet's ability to make future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne battleship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have been twice the weight of the same-sized battleship used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost tag of the entire program, including crew training, was another problem.
It said it had reached a staggering price of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problem of attracting the newest battleships became especially important in terms of recent warnings that the German navy's power was waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the fleet was "deprived of a weapon capable of launching".
Officials say the problem has been solved in time, since the old boat is regularly removed but not replaced.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could join the navy.
The National Trust has heard of Jay's secret life
A new study being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how geese use the environment in their hunting.
Hopefully, the findings will provide new explanations for the behavior of the baby birds with milk and help guide future reproductive activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and small pipistrelles (soprano pipistrelles) as well as the saltwater long-eared bat and the Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the study area to keep track of the activities of the JJ throughout the season.
NHS officers and volunteers will also conduct a mobile detection survey using a mobile detector.
All expert voice recording analysis will look for the frequency of the call and what the person is doing.
Then, a map of the area and a report will be made to establish a picture of the mountain of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, an archaeologist at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the species and how each species uses the land.
This information will help determine the benefits of resource management activities, such as the creation of green spaces, and how well the forest landscape will preserve the flora and fauna involved.
The number of geese in Scotland and throughout the UK has fallen dramatically over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development that has a negative impact on habitat isolation and loss.
Wind and light can be hazards, and some food handling and chemical equipment can be hazards, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, Jay is not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they are tired.
They use a blink-reflective technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes serious care of the case.
It has ten trained specialists who conduct regular surveys, inspect lying islands, and provide occasional assistance.
The organisation also established Scotland's first special and only conservation fund at Threave Field in Dumfries and Galloway, the home of the eighth Duke of York.
The area is a perfect habitat for them, says David Thompson, a property manager.
"At this Threave we have a field set for Jay", he said.
"We have old houses, lots of big trees, and all of them are good places to live.
But there is still much that is unknown about the Jays, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of finding the J before maintaining within the areas because it is possible to destroy the dormant islands of loneliness without pain, killing up to 400 children and mothers, potentially multiplying the total number available locally.
The Jays are protected and killing, abusing or evicting them or destroying their nesting is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a scout officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the congregation to come to the rescue.
"We still have a lot to learn about our ancestors", she says, "and for many of our species we still don't know how many exist".
Ronaldo denies allegations of intimidation as lawyers plan to sue Germany
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the allegations of bullying against him as "fake news", saying that people "must promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer has scheduled a lawsuit against the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portuguese and Venezuelan officials have been holding accusations of harassing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was accused of paying her $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video with 142 million followers less than hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, responded to the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they say today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to preach themselves in my name.
It is normal.
They wanted to be famous to speak my name, but it was a career move.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, cheering.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unacceptable reporting of suspicious content in the sphere of privacy", according to Reuters.
The players will seek compensation for "the psychological damage in an amount commensurate with the concern of the violation, which may be one of the worst violations of privacy in decades", said lawyer Christian Schertz.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a classroom at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a secret meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he was accused of assaulting her, according to the letter filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt after the case was brought and told her he was a "good guy" "99 percent" left "one percent".
The source claims that Ronaldo insisted that the couple had a check, but that was an admission.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographed her injuries at the hospital, but later settled out of court because she felt "scared of the settlement" and worried about "social embarrassment".
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking a settlement because she continues to suffer from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and this summer moved to Italy's top-flight side Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will always regret' losing car makers
The UK "will always regret" if it loses its position as the world leader in car production after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the factory would temporarily stop production at its own plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
Japanese automakers say the impact of a delayed border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost time and jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the crisis breaks out of the EU at the end of March we will still see production stop at our plants", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its own Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern about what automakers say is the risk of supply shortages in a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production lines run on a "just-in-time" basis, with suppliers arriving every 37 minutes in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border freeze which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of food.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than the value of its stock at its own Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "adapted appropriately to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We need a better deal that will allow, as I say, not only the success of now to be enjoyed but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we all need to be able to continue on the high success story of supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, warned that the positive costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually take time off work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union organizer at the plant, says that his members are growing anxious: "In my experience, once these jobs are done, they will not come back.
"We have a proper and credible plan for our future relations with the EU", the spokesman said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "extended by a week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein followed the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump and Russian aides, and obstruction of justice by the president.
Trump's firing of the deputy attorney general and the implications for Mueller's credibility have been a topic of debate in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday he went to the White House where it was reported that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the then-United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" a shoot-out at Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid a clash between Kavanaugh's Democratic House committee and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate within a week the appeal against Kavanaugh, which delayed a full House vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Monday.
Asked about the meeting Rosenstein said: "Not yet fixed a specific date, probably this week. I think it can be postponed to next week so that everything goes on in the Supreme Court".
But they also recognize each other, and I like to keep updates".
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not held a White House interview since September 10.
The funeral director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the difficulty in the meeting was not due to the dissatisfaction of the "famous" TV anchors. He said: "I agree with the fact that they are famous".
He then suggested that direct interaction with Trump and the media would be more interesting.
"The president has done more questions and answers than the previous president", he added without citing evidence: "We've seen from those numbers".
Sanders said the meeting would still take place, but "if the media had a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be much better to ask me.
We're trying very hard to do that, and you've seen us try very hard in the last few weeks, and a brief press release will come when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump is often asked if he is leaving the White House or attending an inauguration or press conference with distinguished guests.
It's very difficult to find a single media.
In New York this week, the president may showcase why the free and sometimes bizarre appearance comes before the press conference.
The Health Secretary has written to the EU's NHS Scotland staff about the dangers of Brexit.
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff at NHS Scotland to express his goodwill to the country and wish them well after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP delivered the remaining letter less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the visa application costs of EU citizens working in its public service.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal remain ongoing, with a decision expected this autumn.
But the UK government was prepared for the possibility of no deal.
I know this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to reiterate to everyone that the participation of all members is valuable regardless of their nationality.
Partners from across the European Union and beyond bring valuable experience and strong expertise and create jobs in healthcare services that benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to live here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
In Tennessee, Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
He came to the side of the field and fell on the pole, Reed said.
The coach and doctors examined Abercrombie's chest on the sidelines before taking the bag up and taking it for further evaluation.
Officials from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not available for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details on the type/scope of the injury yet" and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee after retiring from Illinois.
He had five sacks on Saturday before leaving the game, making him 18 sacks for the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher tax stamp fee when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers would pay a higher tax stamp fee when they bought property in the UK with extra money to help homeless people under the Tory scheme
This move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The tax stamp fee will be charged to non-taxpayers in the UK.
The Home Office is estimated to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers set to pay higher tax stamp fees when they buy property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's campaign success in attracting the younger elite with a promise to make housing cheaper and target higher income earners.
The tax increase would record calls from individuals and companies not paying taxes to the United Kingdom along with special funds that increase the government's push to fight the seven-year housing scheme.
The extra money raised - in addition to the current tax stamps, including the introduction of a higher rate two years ago on second homes and the purchase of rental properties - made up as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Transport estimates that the traffic will increase to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London were bought by foreigners, due to rising prices and making it harder to buy a home for the first time.
Many areas of the country's wealthy - especially in the capital - have become "garbage cities" due to the rise of large numbers of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help more young people so they can have their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by leasing land but not using it and called for May to lift the modest housing quota to address the "damages to housing" of the British population.
Corbyn announced some interesting housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions of "innocent people".
He also wants the minister to have more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate myself to being prime minister to help fulfill the dream of the British people - that life should be better for the younger generation.
And that means a permanent housing shortage in the market.
The UK will be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it can't be easy for non-UK individuals, as well as foreign companies to buy a home as hardworking Britons.
For many people who want to have their own home, it has become a dream too far away and shows that there are still many homeless people".
Jack Ross: 'My highest calling is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "top priority" is to one day become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is challenging the North-East's ability to recover from a third-place finish in League One with three draws in the top flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season.
"I want to play for my country.
I turned on the B switch and that's what happened", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I brought it with me watching the Scotland team in Hampden with my dad as a kid and it's something that keeps me thinking.
The opportunity will come when I succeed in managing the club".
Managers before Ross as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic captain said he felt no qualms about living up to the name established at such a big club having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success now will be judged by 'Can I lead this club to the Premier League?'
"Given the facilities and facilities in the club, there is no doubt that it is definitely a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would look at my own success here if I could get the club back there".
Ross has spent just three years in his managerial career, after being assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in charge of coaching.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and convert St Mirren from relegation to championship winners in the season-ending relegation play-offs.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing days at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It could be a real separation", he recalls Alloa's responsibilities.
"I really believe that directing is more for me, than acting.
It sounds strange because I'm doing well, making life meaningful and enjoying coming up.
But playing can make it difficult.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through the hassle and stress of work, but team management feels like it's the right fit for me.
I've always wanted to manage a team, and now that I'm doing it, it makes me feel more comfortable than I ever was".

The summer heat increased revenue for the UK's failing nightclubs but added pressure on more restaurants.
Entertainment venues and bars saw sales increase 2.7 percent during July - but restaurant sales fell 4.8 percent as the figures were released.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant who compiled the figures, said: "The sunshine is continuing and England's long-term involvement in the World Cup means July is on a similar pattern to June, when the station had a 2.8 per cent increase in sales except for the restaurant drop.
The restaurant business decline in June was down 1.8 percent and even worse in July.
The clubs and bars that sell drinks are the best sellers and people prefer restaurants.
A restaurant and a sheep entertainment center are still in crisis but still not heavily in the restaurant business.
It seems people go out just to drink.
The sales of drinks in bars and nightclubs are up 6.6 percent a month, but food is down three percent".
Paul Newman, RSM leisure and tourism analyst, said: "This trend has been continuing since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when selling in outdoor markets.
It's no surprise that the restaurant group is still struggling despite a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales, but it's also a pain to deal with the pressure of the costs involved.
A long dry season cannot happen when it is not good for restaurant operators and time will tell if the moderate temperatures we encounter in August can make up for more holiday time".
The growth in total sales in bars and restaurants including new stores was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new store openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker's industrial production tracking for UK venues, bars and restaurants collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups totalling approximately $9 billion and is an established industry standard.

Percent of students say they make harmless "main" accounts to show their parents while also having private accounts.
A mother who visited her 13-year-old daughter's secret website encountered a teenager who urged others to "bully me".
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Council (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two pictures, with half of those accepting private collection.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Eilidh Doyle to be the "voice of the sport" of the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most highly regarded track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for the athlete's mentor to benefit from his vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and the global sports community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will greatly benefit from bringing him to the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be a voice for the sport and hope to be able to get involved and lead the sport in Scotland".
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 in Atlanta in all of his four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, is unable to walk after suffering a temporary brain aneurysm.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a ruptured cerebral artery.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time would tell how well I would recover.
It's been hard work but it's made a full recovery, learned how to walk and now is doing bodybuilding!
Thank you for your encouraging comments!"
A dairy farm ad comparing a mother to an elephant has caused a global split.
The breast milk company has been divided in its opinion comparing the breastfeeding mother to a milk cow.
To kick off the launch of what has been described as "the world's first silent, covered milk bottle", consumer technology company Elvie launched a full-length ad that inspired a new, independent, mother-like bottle.
The mother dances in a factory full of dried cow dung with songs that say: "Yes, I give my own milk but you don't see the milk" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not the milk, it's my milk".
The voice goes on: "Fuel it up, fuel it up, I'm giving milk to those babies, fuel it up, fuel it up, I'm giving milk to my girls".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use a cow to promote this product.
"Like those who need to get pregnant and have babies to get milk unless their babies are stolen on the day of birth", one said.
Elvie's milk pump fits in the milk suit.
Another commented: "Of course it's scary for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise milk products for mothers who choose to breastfeed their babies?"
Others added: "He is a promoter who cannot be admitted".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "a good ear".
"I think this is a very cool idea.
I'd buy one if I could still breastfeed.
The water makes me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit lame, but I bought it for what it was.
This is a fantastic product", one wrote.
Another comment: "This is a satirical ad and is aimed at breastfeeding mothers (who are breastfeeding before work or the bathroom) and feel like 'elephants'.

At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they all dance to a soft drink hidden in their sweatshirts.
The idea behind the ad was based on the understanding that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie breast pump is extremely quiet, with no ropes or hoses and hidden inside a suit, giving women freedom to move, conceive and even go outside while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother comments: "The Elvie branded milkshake is a revolutionary product that deserves to be launched with pride and attention.
We want to bring mother's milk and all the challenges that it brings to the fore, while also showing how to enjoy it and the sense of freedom that this new milk machine brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk has made headlines.

Hundreds of refugee children have been quietly moved to camps on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased despite the monthly border crossings remaining unchanged, in part due to the harsh rhetoric and policies used by the administration to make sure the children have supporters.
Usually, the sponsors are mostly undocumented immigrants who are afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country by moving forward to claim children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that able-bodied supporters and senior family members would be required to submit fingerprints and information would be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, told Congress that the unit had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be pedestrian child advocates.
The organization confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior record of violent drug abuse.
"Nearly 80% of the individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters are in countries where the law is not in place and most of them are criminals.
So we are continuing to follow up on the individual", Albence said.
Authorities have proposed new rules that would require some children to appear in court within a month of being held in detention for more than 60 days as a previous standard, according to the Labor Relations Center.
Many people will appear via video chat instead of meeting in person to file their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who do not feel entitled to assistance will be deported immediately.
Children who remain in long-term care will also become anxious or snort, which may lead to violent confrontations or attempts to escape, according to reports from staff staying at the facility who have been out of the system in recent months.
Archaeologists say these concerns are heightened in large places like Tornillo, where signals that children are in trouble are often overlooked due to the large size of the city.
They added that moving children into cities without enough time to prepare for mood swings or to speak well to peers can cause injuries that many still struggle with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
US Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally under the charge of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the meeting.
Moualem asserted that "the terrible war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "in this holy struggle until I wipe out all Syrian territory" of terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in war zones.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said these conditions could be modified to allow them to return, and said that "some Western countries" are "spreading unjustified fear" that keeps refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return", he said.
"They are working on a political agenda that should be truly humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the Russian-Turkish deal has established a safe zone in the most stable group of Idlib's leaders, creating an opportunity to announce ahead of political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevents a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that military action would remove terrorist targets, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which would be "eliminated altogether".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes to hold the first meeting of a new commission made up of government and opposition members to draft a constitution against Syria and launch elections.
Moualem proposed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited "to reviewing the text of the current constitution" and warn against interference.
Why Trump won a second term
For that reason, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberal fans are likely to hope that the nomination and the scandal will end with the presidency.
In what is undoubtedly "the most exciting final chapter of the presidency!"
At this point there is no sign of fan fatigue.
Since 2014, the PM rankings have more than doubled to 1.05 million people on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million people on MSNBC.
Fox News had a total audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years earlier. According to Nielsen, MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" reached 3.5 million on a major news night.
"This is a fire that is making us panic because it is not what we understand", said Neal Baer, ABC's production controller, "a determined survivor", according to the deputy prime minister who became president after the attacks devastated the capital.
Nell Scovell, novelist and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And the Few Facts About Breaking into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled riding a bike in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me a head,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, there's nothing like being on television. His blood that comes from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade.
It is only for exclusive viewers who can afford it.
And it's more than an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour of watching a panel discussion with Bob Woodward using the "behind the scenes" information stream of his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("Pride-comes-with-the-sandwich", The Washington Post said), and Stormy Daniels's meaning as a frightening interpretation of Trump, a caricatured idiot.

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.

Money flows out of the race, midterm elections in the village.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th state will have plenty of cash, thanks to the reorganization of two land-based congregations in the same seat race
Pittsburgh's recent boundary changes pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won election to another council seat last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th oldest district, which covers most of the 17th largest district.
The plan was brought into play again in the boundary issue after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old city was not allowed to divide its electoral district at the request of Republicans.
The 17th re-run of the race was financed in a vote between the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March's election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A record seat held by the Republican Party for decades and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
Political experts have made the Democrats a little more conservative.
The United States sanctions El Salvador, backed by China, then pulls out.
The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already learned that Beijing had little to show for Washington.
Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his traveling companion drove Trump's tour.
Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the US State Department, said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to call US diplomatic officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama during the "final decision that there is no longer a Taiwan".
But only sanctions have been considered against El Salvador, which received US aid in 2017 of up to US$140 million, including narcotics control, development and economic support.
The sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and restricting visa issuance to target groups, could have consequences for Central American countries including high unemployment and murder rates.
While holding a domestic meeting, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting highlighting security and economic security issues to continue a similar meeting that was held last year and was a step in trying to protect refugees from traveling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior leadership officials made a clear statement at a meeting on El Salvador's sanctions review.
The diplomat said Vice President Mike Pence had scheduled a meeting in mid-October as a sign of bringing the leaders together.
And the three American diplomats returned to discuss the problems of El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any sanction from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that the three US ambassadors had discussed, including the two diplomats agreeing to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by outside analysts close to the administration and also cited conditions of anonymity.
The Bible says: "The earth is the work of your hands.
The next event could be Robert Mueller's special report on Trump's obstruction of justice, which now has important evidence on record from the public.
Mueller reports on the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump colluded with Russia in the attack on our election.
If the US federal government's constitution changes, Trump will find himself facing responsibility in an institution that he is prepared to go before the voters and perhaps even the backbone of his colleagues.
That's a lot of problems, and I don't mean to suggest that the failure of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
There are many choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect a long-term battle.
In 1938, German authorities prepared to protest against Hitler, if the West opposed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and had the opportunity to avoid repeated killings.
Major historical events such as the turning point and the unstoppable march of democracy have been accelerated or delayed.
The American people are facing these issues right now.
What should we do if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the top criminal investigator, who controls the Mueller investigation?
Mr. Rosenstein has been in a state of flux since reports last year suggested he had secretly recommended a record of the president's actions and assumed he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein said the Times's report was incorrect.
"How would we react if the FBI's re-investigation of Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair - or he was confirmed by the Senate despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle of the conference on whether to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis who once occupied my hometown.

Graham Dorrans, Ranger team, is looking at the world in a positive light before the clash with Rapid Vienna.
Ranger hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, beating Austrians in a draw between Spain and Villarreal this month. This put them in a position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans injured his knee from the first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers could use the score to reach the win.
"It's a good score for us because Villarreal is a great team", the 31-year-old said.
We went down there and we believed we could dig something up and draw something.
Sometimes we should be full at the end, but the result is always the same.
They did better in the first half and in the second half, our team did better.
Moving into Thursday, another great night of European competition.
We were hoping to get three points, but it will be a tough game because the last game they did so well, but with the fans that are there, I believe we will be full of energy and we will get a good result.
This past year has been a very difficult one with everything that's happened with my injury and the changes in the team, but now I feel like something good is coming.
Good training, a good team, and the players enjoy playing tennis.
We hope to do that and put this game behind us and be successful".
Women don't sleep because they worry about saving for retirement.
Survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, but few had talked to family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they consulted with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of them have talked to their kids about it.
Holly Snyder, vice president of the national insurance business, said people want family members to care, but they don't start talking about it.
It should start like this.
When taking a spouse and children: You cannot have your family take care of you if you do not tell them your needs in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where treatment is available and what care is available, as these options can be a major factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you with how to pay for those expenses.
Your options for long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, cash-value life insurance policies to help cover these costs, or insurance with your own assets provided you have the money.
Details of your legal documents: Ahead of the recent legal challenge.
Buy healthcare software to identify trusted people to take care of your care and ensure that professionals will follow your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider your financial literature.
You may choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that you pay for your medical treatment if you cannot afford it.
Do not overlook small details, such as the fact that your elderly parent has an emergency that requires transportation to the hospital.
Can you give me answers about medication and tell me about what your parents are worried about?
Summarize the plan in writing to be ready.

The victim did not see the gunshot.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police appealed to the witness.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Palu province on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to communication disruptions, the security forces were unable to receive information from Donggala Governorate, located north of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been displaced after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary as the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 kilometres (180 mi) in the north of Sulawesi island.
The Regency, the lower administrative region of the province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Mining and farming are the main economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by multiple tsunami waves over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Reduction Unit.
In 1938, more than 200 people died and hundreds more houses were destroyed in Donggala.
The 1996 Donggala West Tsunami killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in the past year:
2004: On 26 October a major earthquake struck the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province on the northern tip of Sumatra Island. The tsunami affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 along the Indian Ocean coast and more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A severe earthquake struck the western coastal area of Sumatra in late March and early April.
More than 100 people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake causes a tsunami to hit the southern coast and kills more than 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Mentawai Island causes a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A small-scale earthquake in Pidie Jaya in Aceh causes destruction and people are alarmed as they are warned of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed many people.
This time there was no casualty, but more than 100 people died from the tower.
2018: A major earthquake struck Lombok but mostly in the north of the island, killing over 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on terrorism charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence and obstruction of justice, according to an Alaska police report on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone away.
KTUU reported that Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held in an unsecured bond of $500.
The news reported that on Saturday he appeared in court, when questioned about his claims, he declared himself not guilty.
Palin faces one to three felony counts, which means he could face a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
This case is before the Military Court for the State of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he was cheating on her.
Sarah Palin was once criticized by military groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: More than 100 dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused flooding and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications systems down due to the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.

The U.S. Attorney's Office is seeking a rare death sentence for the New York attack suspects.
U.S. federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York attack that killed eight people - a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle lane on a west-side freeway in lower Manhattan, killing several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To impose a life sentence, prosecutors would have to prove Saipov had "intention to kill all eight victims and "intention to cause serious injury", according to a death warrant in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by death, according to the court's ruling.
Several weeks after the attack, the US federal prosecutor's office indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder by false assistance, commonly used by US federal prosecutors on charges of premeditated murder and use of violence and vehicular manslaughter.
The attack would have required "serious planning and pre-planning", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's behavior as "malicious, brutal and malicious".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the state announcement.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the southern district of New York put the death penalty on the last count.
Inmate Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murders of two drug manufacturers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The most recent execution in New York was the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, both executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of consciousness in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told the interrogator that he felt good about what he had done.
Saipov told the leadership staff that he was motivated to attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the complaint.
Police added that he had also asked to have ISIS flags in his room at the hospital.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public prosecutors, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
Patton said: "We think that the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole would only prolong the impact of these incidents for all involved".
Saipov's legal team has asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of negotiating Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "make the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be "excited" by Eurosceptics - one of Theresa May's MPs who advised him on negotiating with the EU.
Peter Bone, the president of the Peace Keeping, told a trip to Birmingham UK 'will come out' now if Farage is the Brexit secretary.
But the challenges Maye faces in negotiating his split have been highlighted by the Tories' entry into the city's anti-Brexit protests.
The Prime Minister is scrambling to get the Chequers customs plan on track amid attacks from Brexit, survivors and the European Union.
The Alliance has insisted he will go ahead with an attempt to protest the deal with Brussels despite the anger - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his proposal and his 'confused' one.
Mr Bone said that by quitting the Solihull meeting he wanted to 'stop Chequers'.
He suggested that Farage should consult with colleagues and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
'If he is responsible, we will leave now,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: 'I will support leaving the EU but we need to stop Checkers.'
Defining his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We did not fight the World War to be slaves.
We need to make our own laws in our country.
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed and still want to keep the story is wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, also at the march, told reporters: 'I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition has not voted for them, it is dissatisfying to our party and our activists all the way and it makes us the first to get elected.
Please put down your Chequers and start listening.'
In a message pointing to May, she added: "The Prime Minister is consistently on duty when they keep their promises".
Farage said politicians should feel 'happy' if they are going to recover from the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us - our people and our politicians", he said.
"They are trying to break Brexit and we are here today to say 'we will not let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want to do our political education, whoever is going to back Brexit, feel excited.
We are mobilizing the people of this country to win Brexit and will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters marched in Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city.
The activists' actions have sent shockwaves through the Tories Against Brexit ban following the group's debut this weekend.
Lord Adonis's staff criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with the parties when opening the meeting.
'These are the people who told us they could have a ready IT system and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a borderless, borderless free trade in Ireland,' he added.
'It's the most amazing story.
Nothing is good about Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to be elected president.
U.S. Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren said she will work hard to be elected president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat Party discussed his term in the midwestern Massachusetts branch on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP incumbent Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign.
He was central to the prediction of Trump's side in 2020.
Saturday night's event at Holyoke was the 36th meeting with lawmakers using a mid-term format since Trump took office.
The meeting participants asked you about the election plan to take the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to travel to Washington to address government issues and that included women going to the top.
Arrest for the shooting death of Sims on the LSU basketball team.
Officials in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that suspects have been arrested in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police say they have arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m., ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help from one of the men seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday on 247sports channel that "Wayde Sims was shot in the head and ultimately died.
Wayde came in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing a weapon and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Station.
A 6-foot-6 kid who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in all 32 games for the 10th time last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes close to world title after team orders him to beat Sebastian Vettel
It became clear at the time that Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, on Saturday the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas started well and almost knocked Hamilton out as he defended his own position in the first two corners and made Vettel attack his team-mates.
Vettel entered the first hole and allowed Hamilton to run into traffic at the end of the group which should have decided the score quickly.
Mercedes entered the race from a lap behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a tyre challenge saw the Ferrari driver slowly get out of the way without risking a break after using a pair of protective gears in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and finished seventh by finishing first on his 21st birthday.
He was in the lead for most of the race, aiming to finish early and beat Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth time.
He finally got into the lead on lap 44 but could not speed up on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and the real bulls told me to pass.
The team did such a good job to get one-two", Hamilton said.
That's unhealthy language.
President Donald Trump criticized lawmakers at a meeting on Saturday for her insistence on not releasing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At the West Virginia meeting, the president did not address Ford directly in front of the House Appropriations Committee, but commented that what happened in the House showed that people were "shy, shy and insincere".
He said that one of the things that could happen and the beautiful thing that happened in the last few days in the House is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and shy and dishonest.
He added, "When you watch the news and you hear the news, you're like, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the news?
Remember his answer... you released a press release about the document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I was just...
I didn't release the news.
One, if you catch one.
Did we release the news? No, we didn't release the news.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing Kavanaugh's allegations by Ford in July and the news was released in early September - but Feinstein denied the allegations that the rumors had not left his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release any news about him", Feinstein told the panel, reports The Hill.
He asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, as he asked me.
But his refusal was not listened to by the president who in a Saturday night meeting commented: "Oh I'll tell you, that's unhealthy language.
Sometimes he might not, but that's the most unhealthy language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president commented that the Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the low, the black, they don't care who they hit, they have to run to who to get power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars returned to the Elite League on Friday losing to Belfast Giants from a 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a two-point lead on the first pitch from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the lead before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard always scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen both won.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving Beauvillier an assist to double the lead four minutes later.
During a difficult opening period, Sullivan brought the game back in at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became Cownie's point guard at 15:16.
Dwyer wanted to make sure the Giants had a break in the first period as he shot into the second frame at the end of the first period.
The hosts scored a new goal and Bouchard put them in the level with another goal in heavy play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee their first lead in the semi-final and he was confident of winning the team's fifth-half of the final.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, were at home in Milton Keynes on Friday night.
Dead air traffic control to ensure hundreds of people on the ground can escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was promoted to a revolutionary after he sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board landed safely.
On Friday, in Sulawesi, after a massive earthquake that caused a tsunami, more than 800 people were killed and many more were missing.
Large earthquakes continue to affect the region and many areas of Palu are covered in debris.
Despite his partner's desperate escape, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He was at the control to convince that Batik Air Flight 6321; which was then running on the runway could take off safely.
He jumped out of the control tower when he thought the control tower was breaking.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for the Norwegian Air Research Unit, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision by Anthonius Gunawan Agung could save hundreds of lives; Australia's ABC News reported.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear about this", he added.
While authorities fear the death toll could reach a thousand, the country's disaster relief unit says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is difficult and very limited.
"The death toll is believed to be on the rise; as there are bodies of victims still trapped under the rubble; while many bodies are still inaccessible", a correspondent from the newspaper Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported.
A 20-foot-high wave destroyed Palu, causing the city to sink in the east.
Military and commercial aircraft were bringing in relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a van is coming to bring the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Convenience stores are everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of International Relief Society Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Relief Society is speeding up the rescue of survivors; but we don't know what they will find in the area.
This is a very bad sign, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the nationwide military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to rescuing the victims from this dangerous place.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by a massive earthquake in Lombok that killed up to 550 people.
Air Niugini says man missing behind Lagoon flight
The airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia; the current says before the plane sank into the ocean. One man is missing after all 47 passengers and crew were rescued safely.
Air Niugini said: "On Saturday afternoon before the release of the victim, no male passengers were seen.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and search teams to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately provide details on the age and nationality of the passenger.
After the plane crashed into the water; while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport; a local rescue boat rescued the passengers and other crew.
Seven passengers were reportedly taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline reported that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in normal condition.
The exact cause of the crash and the events that followed are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy said the plane made a brief landing at the runway of Lagoon Airport.
Witnesses reported that the plane was attempting to stop at the airport.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said: "The plane went down very low.
"That's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were preparing to walk through the deep water to the emergency exit of the submerged plane.
He said: "The flight attendant was confused and couldn't control himself and screamed, which caused him a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said: "House workers working nearby to improve the harbor came to the rescue using a lifeboat to bring passengers ashore before the airport sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) in the sea".
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that in the past two decades 111 passengers of PNG-registered airlines have died as a result of crashes; but not all of them were related to Air Niugini.
Analysts have revealed the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the trial revealed the facts of a case in which the defendant was a Mississippi woman who was burned alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett at the United States Department of Justice detailed the evidence in the field analysis to expert witnesses for several hours.
He detailed to the jury how he used cellphone data to learn about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said: "He has been able to locate the source of the data from a cell phone or multiple devices that suggest Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death; which contradicts what Tellis claims or said earlier in the Clarion newspaper report".
When the information showed that his phone was with Chambers when he spoke he said he was with a cellmate named Michael Sanford, and then the police spoke to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford confirmed and clarified that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night; Sanford said he was "crazy because my car was in Nashville".
Another contradiction that Tellis says is that on the day of Chambers' death he had known Chambers for only two weeks.
Cell phone records indicate they have known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He removed her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin closing the debate on Sunday.
The jury said: "He expects the official evidence test to reach the jury later that day".
The high breed: What is the legacy of hip-hop?
Hip hop groups need to challenge the negative attitudes of their music by filling the hip hop genre with positive or positive messages.
The high breed: from Bristol says hip hop has moved away from its original lyrics with its political message and social commentary.
They wanted to go back to basics and create a platform to make hip-hop popular again.
Composers such as the Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in popularity in the UK as the work of composers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Who is the other ghost?!
New York nanny sues couple who kicked themselves out after receiving "racism-hating" text messages
A New York nanny sues her racially motivated firing after receiving a false message from the child's mother claiming she was "a ghost again".
The couple denied that they were not racist; rather, it was a comparison to "take advantage".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she discovered that a new nanny named Giselle Maurice, who had just returned to work for her family's first day in 2016, was a leper.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is a message that Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she texted Maurice twice.
According to The New York Times, after admitting her guilt "in a state of depression", Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying: "The African-American nanny is doing a bad job and so he hopes to get a Filipino nanny instead".
Maurice gets her day's pay and is sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for damages for self-exclusion and is seeking damages of £350 per day for six months at the original agreed price; although there is no contract.
"I want to show them that you won't do that", he told the paper on Friday, adding, "I know it's racist".
The couple responded to the accusation that they were racist by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a valid reason to act; for fear that they would not be able to trust her after having been unfaithful to her.
"My wife sent something that he didn't mean.
He is racist.
We are not racist", her husband, Joel Plasco, told reporters.
But how can you give your son into the hands of someone you have been angry with? Even though you have not sinned in your heart,
What's your newborn?
Is that right?
It's a tradeoff for profit", Plasco said, adding that his wife had just given birth to a baby two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Will you work with someone after such an incident?
It is a bad thing to do that", the bank investor added.
As the legal process in the public court was underway, the social media couple was quickly denounced; their behavior and ideology were denounced.
Paddington Press is concerned that when a new edition is released, readers may not be interested in the bear eyeball.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, commented on the letter: "It's hard to understand someone after the first reading before publication.
It's fascinating to know what we know about Paddington's great achievement.
It's exciting to know what we know about Paddington's great achievements", said her father; who worked as a BBC beautician before starting was inspired to write a children's book from a small toy teddy bear; which was a positive reflection on his rejected work; he said on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet" following his passing last year.
Of Paddington, who she professes to be "the most important member of our family", she adds that her father is very proud of his achievements.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But because Paddington is so close to him; it's like having a little kid who accomplishes something: you're proud of them even if it's not a real act.
I think he might look at Dr. Paddington's success in that light.
Even if it is his invention and his imagination, he will give it as Paddington's own work".
My daughter is dying, and I need to talk to her on the phone.
When the plane landed his daughter was taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital where doctors worked to try to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was so bad that he would not survive", said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in two minutes and I had to tell him.
And I did just that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much; dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll stay with you.
The doctors kept beating his heart, but his heart seemed to slow down and he passed out.
He died a few minutes before and everything was closed.
I sat there and waited until I realized everything was in my hands.
I can't cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
We need to encourage one another".
Ednan-Laperouse finally mourns the loss of her daughter; she passes the ticket alongside the other passengers - without her realizing how she got through the incident.
"No one knows", she said.
"I bow my head and my tears run all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's in the way I feel about Nad's loss.
My daughter needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
Sad woman hangs suicide prevention signs on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys once posted a sign on the Welsh Bridge with a message of encouragement and a phone number for people to call for help.
Davis' son Tyler, who had been struggling since he was 13, struggled with depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I do every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a global contagion.
"Everyone knows him for his beard.
They like to say his feet brighten every room".
However, he resigned before his death because he "fell into a world of darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's then 11-year-old sister was one of Tyler's cousins who saw her brother's body after his suicide.
Davis said: "I am also constantly worried that it might have an impact.
Davis created the sign "to let people know there's someone out there they can go to and talk to as a friend.
Don't sit in the dark - you need to speak out.
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her husband Mark 15 years ago, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He didn't say he was really upset or stressed or anything", she said.
"Two days before Christmas - we noticed that he changed his mind.
On Christmas Day he was like a rock - when the children opened the container, Mark didn't use eye contact with them or react at all.
She said Mark's death was a great trauma for them; but they had to live with it: "It's a big family wound".
It separates us.
But we must live and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) begins its investigation.
"I think if we could get something as he asks - from a limited time frame; limited scope - we might bring a little bit of evidence", Flake said on Saturday; adding that he was worried the committee might "fail" because it was in the middle of a military siege.
Why did Kavanaugh and his conservative supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is to be overcome by this limited time investigation.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if the Republicans are to be expected to act corruptly; then they will suffer the consequences of their efforts to impeach the person they want on the US Supreme Court.
George W. Bush had received a call from a congressional staff asking them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and had met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI writes a report?
It is likely to be voted on in the House of Representatives, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the US Congress.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to secure the 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of refugees has declined.
Since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees coming to South Korea has been declining, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Refugee Affairs, said there were only 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tight border controls between North Korea and China and high prices paid to road leaders were key factors.
The Korean government in Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
Most North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship.
The South Korean government in Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean refugees have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most cross the border through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China says they are illegal migrants rather than refugees and are being forced to return to their country.
North and South Korean relations - technically still at war - have improved this month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Beijing to discuss key issues related to the nuclear disarmament talks.
This was followed by the first historic meeting between the two leaders, US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed to work together to move the DPRK towards denuclearisation.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of being too lax in its actions to make any progress on the nuclear deal.
"Now that the trust in the United States is gone, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that context, there is no way we will agree to disarm first", Ri said in an address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotionally ill", saying he was unfit to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
House Leader Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "emotionally disturbed" and said he was in too bad a mood to serve on the United States Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments during a press conference Saturday at the Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but wonder; if women have that design, they might call it 'emotional issues,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony ahead of the Senate Judiciary Committee's ruling on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denies allegations of sexual abuse by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the beginning of his keynote address, Kavanaugh was so excited that he cried and couldn't breathe as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also has a clear accusation against the Democratic Party committee that accused him of "inciting and coordinating a murderous conspiracy" carried out out out of anger at the loss of Hillary Clinton to the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed his inability to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court because of evidence of a bias against Democrats.
"I think he has no qualities that fit with himself from the speeches he made and the way he acted behind the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the Senate.
"I would say - right now if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he's not only unfit to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, but he's going to have to go to court", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington, DC, court.
Pelosi added that on behalf of the Democrats, she is concerned about the possibility of Kavanaugh opposing the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he considers it to be a conservative justice.
The confirmation heard questions about whether Kavanaugh would reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision.
"It's not the time for a person with an emotional problem to have a career on the Supreme Court, and we expect to say it's not a miracle", Pelosi said.
And women want to control it.
It was months and years of oppression of the violence that occurred and she couldn't control it now by screaming.
"We cry when we feel bad", 45-year-old Steinem said later.
"I thought it was a cover-up; what do you think?"
He continued, "I was helped by a woman who was an executive in some areas; who used to yell when she was angry; but developed a technique that means when she gets angry and starts yelling; he would go talk to the person he was talking to.
I was angry.
And then he goes on.
And I thought I was smart.
Tears can be part of anger because they have a basis in misunderstanding.
One of my fondest memories from my early days in a male-dominated office; finding myself screaming from inexpressible rage, being held by a woman's neck; being the crazy manager who used to pick me up at the steps.
"Don't let them see you cry", he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and would be happy for you to be".
Patricia Schroeder, who later became a congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987 when Gary Hart was arrested for a girlfriend problem on a foreign ship named Monkey Business and bowed. Schroeder was nervous; he vowed that there was no reason he would not have the idea of researching the reasons for running for president himself.
"It's a non-circular decision-making mindset", she told me with a thunderous voice 30 years later.
"The truth is there are seven candidates who are competing and the last thing they want is another person.
Some call it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was a delayed campaign; he was behind in finding funding and so she swore that she should not run until she could raise $2 million.
It's a battle that won't be won.
He found that some of her supporters gave male candidates up to $1,000 while giving her only $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" she wondered.
When she spoke on the floor announcing that she would not officially run; she felt pressure - from the emotions of her supporters; a dissatisfaction with the system that made it difficult to find funding and candidates to target were harder to represent and a rage against sexism - that made her almost a whore.
"You might think I'm nervous", Schroeder said of the way the reporter treated her.
"You might have thought Kleenex was a good partner for me.
I remember thinking they were gonna put it on my tombstone?
"She came out crying"
How a US-China trade war would be good for the Chinese government in Beijing.
The opening of a Sino-US trade war is a sign of calm and while the battle is far from over; the split between the two countries could be good for China in the long run; experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched his first war-opening campaign earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels and aluminum.
Most importantly, through the calculation of import duties, up to 200 billion dollars (£150 billion) of impact is made on half of the Chinese imports to the US from China.
The Chinese government in Beijing has responded each time by category; currently raising tariffs from 5 percent to 10 percent on US goods worth up to $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the US head-on, and the world's second-largest economy must be in constant peril soon.
To make Washington lose economic power means finding the will; but publicly bowing to the US may be difficult for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Experts say that if China is caught in a trade war between the two countries, it could benefit China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision, whether it be the United States or China, can create an uncontrollable situation in a country; which may actually be a more dangerous threat than mutual acceptance before", said Abigail Grace, Asia-specific researcher at the US National Security Policy Institute.
The Syrian foreign minister said:
Syria is ready to welcome refugees back. Syria is ready for refugees who want to return and need help to rebuild the country from more than seven years of war.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem speaks at the UN General Assembly.
"The regional situation today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in countering terrorism", he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to rebuild the country.
All the current circumstances can make it difficult for refugees who wish to return to their home countries to leave due to terrorism and the economic impact that this has on the lives and livelihoods of the rice farmers.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still about six million people living in countries that need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the country.
But he said it may not be acceptable from the perspective of aid or aid from countries that support the opposition.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team in the final by 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Stadium outside Paris; the Netherlands.
The current U.S. team has lost to a European team on European soil six times in a row and has not won the European Cup since 1993.
Europe scored a point as Denmark's Thomas Bjorn had 14.5 points to beat the United States.
US golfer Phil Mickelson struggled throughout the tournament, but he scored a goal on the third hole of the 16th hole, which caused him to lose to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari won his round; becoming one of four players to achieve an unprecedented 5-0-0 score since the tournament began in 1979 to date.
American Jordan Spieth hit 5&4 to place him in the bottom of the European team standings behind Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one golfer Dustin Johnson dropped to second and Ian Poulter of England to last.
The eight-time Ryder Cup champion was Spain's Sergio Garcia, who became the all-time European winner with 25.5 points.
"I never cried; but today I couldn't help it.
It's the year of the landing.
So thank you, Thomas, for bringing me on the team and believing in me.
I am very proud and very happy to win again.
It's a team thing and I'm happy to help the team", Garcia said after the win.
He sent a lightning bolt to his follower John Ram who could beat the US golf course Tiger Woods 2&1 by one play on the day of the draw.
"I felt a tremendous sense of pride, to be able to beat Tiger Woods; I grew up following that man", said 23-year-old golfer John Ram.
Woods missed all four of his games in the Netherlands and is currently 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A rare statistic from one of the greatest golfers of all time; having won 14 majors, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team battled throughout the weekend to take the field with no exceptions including Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, the top players of the entire tournament.
U.S. National Team player Jim Furyk said after the game, "I'm proud of these golfers; they fight.
It was this time of morning when we got the heat in Europe.
We lost.
Drop the hat and bow to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We're going to re-merge; I'm going to work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm so proud to be a part of this team.
You've been rewarded.
We played very well".
Red Tide breaking news: What's happening in Pinellas County, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission indicates that a slight decline in Red Tide is occurring in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC report, the state of the lily is occurring in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - meaning there is a significant decline in concern.
The seaweed in Red Tide extends over a 130-mile wide area of coastline from north of Pinellas to south of the community of Lee.
Patches can be found over 10 miles off the coast of the Hillsborough community but only a few sites have been available in the past week.
Red Tide has also been observed in the Pasco community.
Outbreaks in or off the coast of the Pinellas community were reported last week; low-level outbreaks in the coastal area of the Hillsborough community; and but there was an increase in the Manatee community and medium to high-level outbreaks in the Charlotte community and high-level outbreaks in or off the coast in the Lee community and low-level outbreaks in the Collier community.
That pressure continues to be reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier communities.
Last week; an unreported phenomenon was in northwest Florida.
