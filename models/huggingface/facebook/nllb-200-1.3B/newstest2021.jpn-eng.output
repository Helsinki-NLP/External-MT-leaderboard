I'll start with the cut before I cut my hair.
細くてやわらかく、多め。
クセがある、特に梅雨の季節はボワッとしてしまうためストレートパーマをかけることも。
流し前髪を合わせた重めのセミロングです。
The cutting is finally starting!
カットしやすいように、まずは全体軽く濡らします。
Then, we divide the happi (the upper part of the head that is most exposed) and cut it from the bottom.
And, by the way, hair points are here to get closer to everyone!
1 タブルバング 前の髪 前髪の内側をほんの少し短くすることで、フルで下ろすとやや厚め、軽く分割すると肌が透けるシースルーに... etc、スタイリングによって変化を楽しむ。
2 クセ 生かしたカット 多毛のクセありさんが毛量を減らしすぎ、よけに広がるということも。
KeyPp balance, so that your own life can live, while consulting the balance, and also to spread the balance.
3 顔周りのレイヤーとおくれ毛レイヤー=段差をつけて切るカットのこと。
If you put a layer around your face, the movement becomes easier.
お毛くれは、こめかみ、もみあげ 前後の3カ所に作れば,サッとまとめ髪にした時もおしゃれのように見える。
If you cut your hair together, you cut your face around your face.
顔周りの上部の毛束を前に引き出し、毛先をちょんちょんと切る。 顔周りの上部の毛束を前に引き出し、毛先をちょんちょんと切る。
This makes it easier to move when the hair is cut down. (this is the layers cut)

吉村知事、対コロナで『ぐるなびと提携する 」 (サンケイスポーツ ) - Yahoo!ニュース (Spanish for "Spanish for "Spanish")
The mayor of Osaka, 吉村洋文文知事 (45) announced that he is considering a partnership with the restaurant information website "ぐるなび" as part of the new coronavirus infection prevention measures.
In Osaka, from the beginning of this month, the "infection prevention declaration stickers" were issued to the operators who adhere to the guidelines to promote the prevention of the spread of infection and provide comfort to the people of the city.
However, the number of stickers issued in the 府下, which is said to be more than 120,000 in restaurants alone, remains at 11,000 stores.
So the governor of the village said, "I want to do it at the end of the month, but I'm going to partner with the " ぐるなび " company, and when booking, I'm going to put out the issuing store of the declaration sticker, and make it known at the booking stage".
"The important thing is not to combine '夜街' and '夜街' together. We should clearly distinguish between shops that do and do not do infectious diseases. It is also important to increase the number of shops that do and do things".

写真=Getty Images ヒートのスクリメージ(練習試合)初戦はキングスとの対戦。
This match, which was won by a 104-98 score, Duncan Robinson scored 18 points for Team High, Tyler Hero scored 15 points for the rest of the game, and the backcourt was very active.
Robinson, a top-seeded player in the Liga, will obviously be a key factor in the draft, as the entire 13th-seeded team will be a key player in the draft, and the hero's step-up will be a key factor in the heat.
ヒーローは足首のケガにより2月~3月間の15試合を欠場し、戦復帰した3月12日のホーネッツ戦を最後にシーズンは長い中断期間に入った。
ヒーローは"時間たっぷりだったから100%のコンディションを取り戻せました. 〜今まで感じた最高の気分だ"と語っているが,スクリメイジでのパフォーマンスが言葉よりも説得力があった。
先発ポイントガードであるケンドリック・ナンの合流が遅れたためにヒーローのプレータイムが増え、そのチャンス生かした形。
15 points for a different role and a better performance than usual, so it's worth a lot.
Team leader Jimmy Buttler also praised the hero of 『 お気に入り 』
"あいつはハンドラーもできるし、得点を取れるし、ディフェンスもできるし、チームのために何でもできる選手である. どんなポジションでもできるのは,考え方はルーキーのものではないから. 映像を見て研究し、チームメイトがどこでどのように動いているかフリーになるし、自分はそのために何をすべきか,自分の頭に叩き込んでいる"
From the start of this season, Batler likes the hero's "ルーキーらしからぬ負けん気の強さ" and his "ストイックな姿勢" in the basketball game.
That's why I invited him to the personal practice of the morning 4 o'clock start, and we trained together.
Butler once said, "He never backs down from telling anyone his opinion, he never backs down. Such a fight can be respected".
The batter is the type who always speaks his mind, and if he thinks it's for the team, he will take a hard line, knowing that there will be a conflict.
This has also led to deterioration of the relationship with teammates in the past.
Batler is probably putting himself on the hero if he is younger every day.
The character of a batsman who is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, becomes a good guide for those who have enough guts to come up with ideas about it.
If the relationship between two disciples who respect each other and are good friends can spread to the whole team, the team can become a team that can aim even higher.

As stated in the initial, 冒頭上、冷やし中華は、中国的"涼面 (リャンバンミエン/冷やし混ぜそば) " ≫ is based on a designated 、日本発祥の中華料理 (日式中華) ≫
Therefore, 、もももは, in China does not exist, 、食の多様化から, 、夏になると日本料理店で見かけるようになってきた。

Naturally, though, the taste of Japanese Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people as well.
Therefore, they tend to be dismissed as not tasting, lacking in impact, and poorly judged.
『冷やし中華』 is no exception, and China is still a minority.
Because、中国で冷やし中華の名称は 、 『 日式冷 」 。
It is recognized as one of the Japanese cuisines by the Chinese.
The Summer's Time is "Summer" (sometimes called "Summer")
China in the summer feels like a meal, when you say "cool (リャンピー) " you don't mean?
I think there are many people in Japan who are not familiar with it, but 涼皮は、西 (シャンシー) 省発祥の小麦粉や米粉、デンプン etc.

"涼" is written on it, but 、 Japanese冷やし中華のように、氷でしめる事はしない。
Rather, the usual temperature is basic.
 on top of that, add the flavor of the medicine, such as 千切りにしたキュウリやニンジン、でたモヤシなど、好みの具材をトッピングし、パクチー、唐辛子、生、ニンニク、
Finally, mix 油やラー油、お、胡麻ペストやピーナッツペスト, etc. and finish with special seasonings 
喉越しがよく、プルプルしているに、酸味が爽やかで濃厚なピリ辛いタレがよく絡みつき、夏バテ気味で食欲がない時でもスルッと入る。
It is also a characteristic of the 涼皮, as it is permeated throughout China, and there are various toppings and flavours, and a lot of variations, and it is one of the ways of enjoyment.

"Cold water" brings health and happiness to the body and mind - Yahoo!
肌痛等炎症を抑える
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy found that the effects on physical and mental healing can be expected.
By taking cold water after exercise, you can control muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Kassa, who is the director of the Korea Stringer Institute, and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold shower as quickly as possible without wasting time. Lowering body temperature immediately after exercise can help you recover faster from exercise-related inflammation and fatigue".
疲労を軽減する  It is a great way to reduce fatigue
If you exercise at high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin will usually need more blood flow.
"When exercising, the heart rate increases, which increases the blood flow to the heart, and the muscle blood flow increases, which requires energy to contract the muscles. And when it comes to the skin, there is also a lot of blood flow to regulate body temperature", Professor Kassa says.
" "Having a cold shower can reduce the amount of blood flow to the skin by lowering the temperature of the skin, and thus reducing the amount of blood flow to the skin. Instead, it can be sent to the intestines, such as the stomach, so that water and nutrients can be absorbed more easily after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise".
Hopefully the effect of the HORMISIS
ドロゼフスキーさん、 also explains that you can expect the "ホルミシス効果" effect when you take cold water.
The concept of the "hormonal effect" is the idea that it is better to have a little harmful substances or stress than not having any at all.
"Low-oxygen exercise, fasting, and cold showers are prime examples of the health benefits of hormones. Cold showers can stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, increase physical strength and resilience".

There are museums where anyone can touch art for free, whenever they want.
The variety of the collection ranges from famous painters such as Kloord・モネやグスタフ・クリムト to unknown artists in the country.
The online museum "HASARD ((((アザー)) " has gained even more attention since its "開館" in April 2019, when its convenience and novelty captured the hearts of users, and the coronavirus pandemic brought a new way of life.
サイトを立ち上げた八戸市出身の野真之介代表代表 ((26) =東京都在住=は"Everyone wanted to create a service that could easily enjoy art. つらい状況下こそ、芸術に触れてほしい」と話す。
アザを訪れると驚かれるのが、展示の豊富さと画像の美しさ。

"We want to let in those who are not interested in art" (野代表) with思いからで、絵の中にいるような感覚を味わえる。
野代表とアートの出合いは小学生の頃。
When I visited with my family at the newly completed 青森県立美術館, I was struck by the force of the three huge paintings of "アレコ" by Márク・シャガール.
The next day, art classes were changed to fun hours, and after I had finished university, I started to go to galleries.
At the same time, I also felt that many people, from different perspectives, did not have much opportunity to come into contact with art, such as the museum was not close by, large exhibitions were held only in the capital, it was difficult for the child to go out, etc.
So, after working at an IT-related company, I spent about two months and started a website where I could see art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 users per month in the first 10 months; after the spread of the new coronavirus infection, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone could enjoy art in a free form whenever he wanted to ― 。
アザーの狙いは、コロナ禍により、図らずもより多くの人に受け入れられた。
The representatives of 野 stressed the importance of the Kunst鑑賞, and emphasized that it enriches the imagination.
"If imagination is enriched, you can reach out to those in need".
"We want to be a better society by getting closer to each other".
China's quality age is over, Japan's quality age is coming Simple reasons (((現代ビジネス)) - Yahoo!ニュース
The transformation of values in the pandemic
There have been many predictions and debates about the world of post-pandemic.
In the business world, the changes mentioned in the article "The jobs of managerial jobs are beginning to disappear in Japan now ... !the cruel reality" and the article "The world of the 4th of July" ("The world of the after the coronavirus"), "The job of managerial jobs is beginning to disappear in Japan now ...!" and the article "The world of the 4th of July" ("The world of the after the coronavirus"), "The changes mentioned in the article "The manufacturing industry of Japan is beginning to disappear now ...!" and so on, may occur.
写真 Japanese only know the true nature of "日本強さ"... Asian reality is unexpected
Also, mentally, it seems that the streams will become mainstream, such as the article of June 26 "The 'totally burning of the mind' to give to those who became aware of the end of life in the corona" and the article of June 10 "The corona, full of violence, now let's review the effectiveness of the 'hard time of the Lord's trust'".
And the fact that the two "matter (経済・ビジネス) " and "spirit" appear to be clearly visible to our eyes as a composite form is the great trend of "China quality to Japan quality".
For example, if T shirtやデジカメで不良・欠陥があるなら腹立たしいことだが, 購入した人の命には別条がない。
In contrast, the recently talked about quality of Chinese-made masks and artificial respirators ... ... "Chinese quality" in such products directly related to life and safety is fatal ...
How much cheap it is, such a product cannot be bought.
They would pay a fair price but they would want "Japanese quality" goods.
Of course, this trend is not unique to Japan.
It is also evident from the fact that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to the lack of masks and medical equipment, nevertheless made repeated "returns" to the very bad of "China quality".
安さ is more comfortable than 安・安全
Also, goods such as vehicles are goods whose defects can be fatal (accidental death).
Even if countries that start with the "安かろう悪かろう" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安かろう悪かろう" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安かろう悪かろう" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安かろう悪かろう" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安かろう悪かろう" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "安売り戦略" of the "中韓韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of the "中韓" of "中韓" of "中韓" of "中韓" of "中韓" of "中韓" of "中韓" of "中韓" of "中韓" of "Japan" of "Japan" of "Japan" is "Japan".
And, this pandemic reminded us that many other goods also need "安心・安全".
、安心・安全 is also important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and services".
トイレットペーパー騒動のように、生産能力が適切にあるのに、中間流通が滞留して手元に届かないことが起こる。
Additionally, as in the article "Who is the real culprit of lack of masks? Who is the real culprit of lack of masks? The Chinese Communist Party government's fireplace thieves?
It is very important that, if possible, every country should be able to give priority to its own needs, so that it can procure essential goods such as medical equipment and food at home.

Whether or not the white is white, or whether it is a painting with properties that reflect more light, do not absorb heat, or not, was also the latest area of research.
Recently, the Henry Samuel School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA, in collaboration with researchers from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, announced that they have found a method of matching white paint that can most efficiently reverse solar heat and increase the cooling effect of buildings' interiors.
                                                                                                                                                                                           
The white painting with the highest solar reflectivity ever was the one with the highest reflectivity of 85%, using titanium oxide.
White paintings already using titanium oxide are already applied to the roofs of buildings in high temperature environments, etc. They are used to block the sun and increase the efficiency of the refrigerator.
However, newly discovered is the white painting of poly (PTFE) based on the resin of the wood used in the preparation of fried bread.
It is believed that a significant heat cut is possible with the white painting that applies this teflon effect, reflecting sunlight up to nearly 98%, and the use of a solar cell.
In the summer, even in the summer, thanks to the unexpectedly made white painting with teflon, the interior is easy to spend without being exposed to the heat.
Maybe that time is coming soon, right?
I'm worried that the roof of Japanese houses is a lot darker, but from now on, the white roof will be the mainstream.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan has formalised the consideration for the revision of the MNP (Money Transfer System) which allows the use of the same number as the existing telephone number when changing a mobile communications company.
At the 21st-day Authors' Conference, the government has outlined its policy to amend the MNP's guidelines, which were adopted in 2004.
The specific points of discussion are various, such as the nature of the MNP hand count, the absence of a drawback for the candidates for the transfer.
The reaction from the communications companies is also expected in the middle, and the promotion of sound market competition can be concentrated attention.
ケータイ乗り乗り換え放題がほど遠い通信各社の闇 MNPが導入された06年 当初の利用者負担料は2000円だったが、現在3000円。
携帯通信大手3社のMNP手数料収入は, according to estimates, is estimated to reach 15.9 billion yen annually ― 。
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea (MNP) has listed the current situation regarding the MNP at the 21st "Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG) " (有識者会議) to discuss the competitive environment of the telecommunications market and other issues.
 The MNP予約番号の発行受付時間も、やり玉に挙げた。
The major telecommunication companies are accepting on the web, but from the convenience of the operation of the root system, etc. 、 接受時間帯は9―20時間が主流。
The WG materials contained a statement that would be the direction of future considerations, and the principles of the end-of-day response.
For those who wish to transfer in MNP, the mobile telecommunications company also considers it a problem to give points, such as to give points.
Excessive drawbacks are judgments that hinder fair competition and are not admissible.
The WG member, the northern partner of the North-East Asian Research Institute, which is a member of the WG, recommends that "if you have time to explain the provision of economic benefits, or if you have permission from the user, then you will quickly issue a number and end the process for the user who does not allow it.It is important to thoroughly complete this process first".
However, in a series of discussions, the MNP fee is the subject of a structural problem: "The higher the customer, the harder it is to get out, the more difficult it is to get motivated to go down".
If there is a business that takes the lead in lowering the MNP fee, there is a concern that the company will increase customer outflows or that the business's efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry also noted that many countries overseas do not charge user fees for MNP, and that Japan is likely to do so.
The General Ministry of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea considers that the results of the WG should be compiled as a report in the period 9―10 months, and then the procedure for the revision and revision of the MNPA guidelines should be initiated.
If the amendment is made, the period of time will be 21 years afterwards.
Mobile communications companies are likely to be a headache, including the type of sales and customer support they provide.

A Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of the river│復元はせず作品へ(octane.jp) - Yahoo!ニュース
In 1994, there was an incident in the Netherlands where a Ferrari Montdial was stolen.
The police had not been able to solve the problem for some time, but 26 years later, miraculously, the monument was discovered.
The phenomenon that led to the discovery of the "Ferrari" (foto 4 point) found at the bottom of the river was the "dives training" of the fire department.
On 8 July, a trained diver found something in the shape of a wedge at the bottom of the river, and the police and the Dutch army moved, and when they lifted something, it was a monkey.
By comparing the VIN number with the stolen car database, we were able to link this incident to an incident in 1994.
The car is handed over to the insurance company, the legal owner, and then to the scrap seller.
Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, a scrapper, said: "There are still some parts that are left, but they are for the art of decorating.

A子先生 is in total control of the household.。
Because the months of the university examination were more than the month of the school leaving, my husband negotiated to reduce the amount of the college leaving, but the decision was rejected.

Later, A 孫 さんが夫にインタビューしたとき, "小遣いなどが管理されていることに不満があるものの,家計の様々な出し入れ (例えば学校教材費とPTA費など) を管理する時間や気力がない,とは本音" ということでした. 
旦那が家計を管理する:B子さんの場合 専業主婦のB子さんは、旦那から生活費を渡されて毎日切り盛りしています。

Then B子さんは思わず『旦那はドがつくほどケチ』と友達に愚痴してしまったと伝えました。
