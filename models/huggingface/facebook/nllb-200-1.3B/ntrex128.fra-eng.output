Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about being puppets
Welsh MPs are appalled by a proposal to replace their titles with MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is the result of a proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, some Members of the House feel that this could be ridiculed.
One Labour MP indicated that his group is concerned that the acronym  rhymes with Twp and Pwp .
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (the Welsh Party) is not satisfied and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative Party is reportedly open to a name change, but has noted that the gap between MWP and Muppet is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced like the letter u in the English region of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, has indicated that the final decision on the appointment of the members of the Assembly is up to the latter.
The Government of Wales Act 2007 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was widely supported.
On the question of the title of Members, the Commission is in favour of Welsh Members of Parliament (WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove a real headache for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The final decision on the name will be taken by the members of the Assembly during the debates on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called  Republic of North Macedonia .
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its neighbour Greece, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long insisted that the name Macedonia constitutes a claim to its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbour's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in trouble, St. Martin's bells silenced
"The elderly people I spoke to said that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street corner", Mr. Adams said.
 There are none today 
He thinks it's normal that bars have become scarce.
"Today, we don't date the same way", he says.
 We used to go to the bar like we were next door, but that's not the case anymore. 
As for the churches, the money from the sale of buildings will be used up much sooner than the authorities think and this worries him:  sooner or later, they will return to the starting point .
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
 The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will rush the closure of all the churches, as they are unlikely to become members, he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built both churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which was preaching in the area, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, where blacks struggled to get jobs or get promotions.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
which Father Johnson's son and successor at the head of St. Martin's Church, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "Bells of the Poor People".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name:  a cultural treasure  and  an irreplaceable historical instrument .
It also mentions that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took a seat in front of the larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin did not replace him.
In recent months there has been much talk of the architectural and entrepreneurial stirring up of the church's secular elite on the one hand and the Episcopal Diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, the governing body of lay people, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese might want to impose the costs on it, even though it had not participated in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old boy injured by shark during lobster fishing
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television station, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and started paddling to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the boy was screaming for joy at having a catch, but then he realized that he was actually
He was bitten.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was yelling for everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark!' " Chad said.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is not known.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles said a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to launch an offensive in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's has a small presence in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and provides them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK £2.8 billion aesthetics market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home goods are falling, wider beauty product ranges will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experiment proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's has indicated that it will increase its range to 3,000 cosmetics, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also have more space in areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reopening its Boutique make-up line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and a second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket executives must work hard to attract consumers, who are increasingly shopping online and heading to local stores for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets will increasingly resemble large stores, as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores since purchasing the two chains two years ago, which the group says has helped boost sales of consumer goods and make the acquisitions profitable.
Previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetics shops of the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended following a controversy over the distribution of profits from supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy was implemented after the sale of its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty product shelves has been modified to improve the environment for customers.
 We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now unquestionable and is changing shopping habits", added Mr Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones's anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
The star of the television programme Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, is furious after the announcement that host Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from an £11million contract linked to her home decor brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the Truly brand of interior decorating and accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their successful textile and interior design business at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV darling revealed, at a tense meeting at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den star's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new £1.5 million contracts no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their interior decoration and accessories brand.
The Truly brand has been likened to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and could have doubled the value of the entertainer's estimated £11million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on her private jet to one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to a source, Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
and is set to secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's headquarters is full of ready-to-sell products.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most bankable celebrities, could cost the company millions, due to the heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and underwear, and the risk of a delayed launch.
And it could end a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of that year.
The couples were on vacation together, and Peter Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night he didn't want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but we loved each other.
Trump has mocked the media for criticizing him for his comment that some consider unworthy of a president, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
"I'm not going to be able to do this", he laughed, taking the voice of a TV reporter.
I didn't give up anything.
He said Kim Jong-un had expressed support for a second meeting, after Trump called the first, held in Singapore in June, a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearisation are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
He deplored that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain the pressure exerted.
In his rally speech Trump offers a far more optimistic outlook.
 All is well with North Korea , says the US president.
We're on the brink of armed conflict.
 Millions of people are said to have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of US servicemen to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there are barely more than 200 standing in front of me", he said, pointing to the crowd.
Tsunami: A devastated island and hundreds of dead in Indonesia
After the earthquake that hit Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10% of the population of Lombok was dispersed, but no national disaster status was declared, a prerequisite for the deployment of international aid.
 Unfortunately, they have made it clear many times that they do not want international aid, which complicates things a bit, Ms Sumbung regretted.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant earthquakes, the country is severely short of resources to protect itself from the caprices of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm sirens sounded in Palu, which may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make it more difficult to use transport.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made the reform of the dilapidated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums on repairing roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined Mr Joko's government, which is expected to stand before the electorate next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from persistent ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Muslim majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, amidst street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has scored a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute, on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goals and his team led 1-0.
He shot the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The ball flew over the repair surface before heading towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its way to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to get in position, to get the ball but players like Shaq always shoot as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking I decided to shoot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward kicked a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before running into midfield and sprinting to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth in midfield,
Then he fired a magnificent deep-bore shot that brought Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overtook the defence and finished his run in the second-row net, with a left-footed shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League, which will take place at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: 832 victims of tsunami
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami had killed 832 people.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its population of over 380,000, was strewn with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death in John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging residents who may have seen or heard something to come forward.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I particularly appeal to the taxi drivers who may have caught something on their dash cam and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation. 
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a Birkenhead property where she was staying.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police have indicated that they are informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building will be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene,
I repeat: "This is too horrible".
At 2pm, two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several agents were watching the building from the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, according to the register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the latest victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be a just reversal of the destruction of countless religious and cultural assets in England by its puritan supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr Crick's proposal unreasonable and called it a revisionist attempt.
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that given the current debate over the removal of statues, it was obvious that the statue of Oliver Cromwell erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is probable that he sacrificed himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to the esteem in which he was held in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated. 
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
The man, identified as M, Yuan, was found dead, with his artery slit and covered in blood near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pigsty was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and blood was flowing from its mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the 250kg animal mutilated the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the rancher's cousin, said his legs were crushed and covered in blood.
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 0440 on Thursday to feed his animals.
Her body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that killed Mr. Yuan was neither his farmer's nor his cousin's.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked away to prevent further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
The family of Mr. Yuan and the market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig had trapped a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife had managed to drive him away.
In 2012, when a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not aggressive in principle, but that the taste of blood could cause such behavior.
They're rather playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting anyone.
He said that all that was needed was to show them the respect they deserve.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will bring intense tropical humidity northward in the southwestern United States.
It's going to rain up to 25 centimeters in parts of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest over the coming days.
At local level, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
Rainfall is expected to be between 5 and 10 centimeters in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains can cause flash floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms could produce gusty winds and dust storms in places.
The approaching depression will lead to heavy local rainfall in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
Rainfall totals can be more than 1.3 cm, which could cause small debris flows and make the pavement slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will hit all four corners of the country on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
This can cause a dramatic change in weather over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will experience considerable temperature variations on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees over the southern plains and other parts of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial draws more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television stations on Thursday, the stunning hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were watched by more than 20 million people.
As the political deadlock continues, the broadcasters interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theatrical stunt: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford assured that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had touched himself and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed he was also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of over 20.4 million.
The company calculated the viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people who watch TV in the office.
By way of comparison, the trial drew as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched channel on the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
The next three were CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), also according to Nielsen.
Interest did not diminish after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing out on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras uncovered a scene in which the senator is caught by protesters as he attempts to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake looked down for several minutes as CNN broadcast the arrest live.
"Don't look away, look at me", one of the women said.
Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are destitute.
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering the session live a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure for advancing Kavanaugh's nomination by the full Senate.
Flake said, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, which was demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after consulting Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice was a heavy one, as the Republicans would not have actually gotten the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a preliminary inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making  small politics 
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of making "small politics" at the expense of Britain's future and national interests.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attacks on her so-called Chequers plans, saying that the proposed free trade between Britain and the European Union was  purely ridiculous .
Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was stabbed and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail has been set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, which determined that the death was caused by a gunshot wound that went through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department acknowledges the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police, as well as by citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their commitment and their quest for justice.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3, 200-pound player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and in shock after news of Wayde's death.
"We're afraid of this kind of event all the time", Wade regretted.
Mexico City: A volcano spews ash
Ashes escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended that Mexicans stay away from the volcano, after recording a spike in activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several rumblings and tremors coming from the Popocatepetl.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, located 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists as the anniversary of the independence vote approaches
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of protesters joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not empty tourists.
Clashes also broke out later in the day, as police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting 'neither forget nor forgive' faced unionists shouting 'long live Spain'.
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by the separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped out on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
The same thing happened, but they had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year we witnessed a great moment.
My parents cried with joy at the thought of being able to vote, but now we are at a dead end, he laments.
Despite their crucial, albeit slim, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders in exile or in detention awaiting trial for organising the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for the blockade of the situation, on both sides.
He regrets that the tension is only rising.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"I think this is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government", he added.
London: Men hit a house with their car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly raiding a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly shot.
Livingston wins game 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures the victory of Livingston
Livingston's recently promoted team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games to Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to finish in second place in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are without a win away from the Premiership this season, and face Hearts on Sunday, who lead by eight points.
But first, the Rangers will face the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston's undefeated streak extends to six games, and their head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, can boast of not losing a game.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of stifled opponents
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before they scored, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson attempted to break through but was stuck in front of the opponent's goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass from Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers have the ball, knowing they could get in their way with elaborate tactics.
That's when the decisive goal came.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to corner Menga, who took a touchdown and scored from midfield.
At this point, the Rangers were dominating the game but faced an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half was the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped a shot by Scott Pittman with his foot, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston goalkeeper repulsed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed at Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul.
The Livingston phenomenon - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and team composition have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
It's a big city with a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was magnificent and beautifully organised, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in check for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their previous talent.
They missed one last chance and only managed to break through once; this is a warning to the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the board.
Mixed reception of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques in the world.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Citing security reasons, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to their country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects this dual vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and called an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 local time near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, emergency services arrived on the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about a mile from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing everything possible to identify the individual and alert his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been set up.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison guards were injured in a riot.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin, located in Worcestershire, at around 0930 local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialist riot police were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a wing of the prison.
On the spot, officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison administration said: "Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be held accountable by the police authorities and may face prolonged sentences. 
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, are held at HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison warden was hospitalized after being assaulted by a prisoner.
In October last year riot police were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could benefit areas affected by drought)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's likely to do so early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwest desert with what's left of its power.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecasts as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained depression or tropical storm status within a 300-kilometer radius around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall, and up to 15 centimeters in locations in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated total measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be a lifesaver for drought-stricken areas that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring System, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second-worst category, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its path along the coast of the Baja California Peninsula.
Still strong Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It's expected to hit the Mexican coast with hurricane strength Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall could lead to a risk of flooding.
 A total of 7.5 to 15 centimetres of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora and could reach up to 25 centimetres, weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression.
 Heavy rains are expected in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert and are the main danger , the National Hurricane Center explained.
It is estimated that these precipitations will lead to potentially deadly flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. local time Saturday.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Avon and Sommerset Police said they had arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have issued a call to anyone who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh was the victim of the Democrats' malice and anger
A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the Democrats' malice and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, energetically and emotionally rejecting allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage today.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished jurists with a brilliant career in public service", he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President made indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever, he said.
 That's why I'm fighting on all fronts for great candidates. 
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party source on CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, and the toll is still rising
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them swept away by huge waves that hit the beaches as an earthquake followed by a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when waves six metres high flooded the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
When the tsunami threat came yesterday, everyone was still on the beach, people did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (NDCA), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long, narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and property could be greater on the 300 km of coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were  completely paralyzed  from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
 The situation is dramatic and could well get worse, she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not releasing information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the roof of a building frantically shouting at passersby in the street that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water slammed into the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has started delivering aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of the relief effort, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll from the tsunami is on the rise, with more than 800 people dead.
This is a tragedy.
World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in shelters set up in the courtyard of their offices, and encountered devastating scenes along the way, Doseba said.
They told me they had seen many houses destroyed", he explained.
This is a tragedy.
When aid groups started to help the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And it hasn't happened yet.
 This disaster is still considered regional,  says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 As soon as the government declares this a national disaster, international assistance can intervene. 
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday hit Palu, the relatives of the missing were still hoping for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were held a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr Mandagi added.
"As an elder in the parasailing discipline, I experienced my own tragedies", he explains.
In the hours after the Roa Roa Hotel collapse was announced in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages went unanswered.
I don't think they ever got my messages.
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 while reloading a vending machine.
Friday morning, robbers extorted $26,750 from a Brink's officer charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was draining a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for the vendor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities is requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now calling himself Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote:  Formerly known as Kanye West. 
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made the change just before going on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces Ariana Grande, who cancelled her appearance for emotional reasons, the show's creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional nickname, the nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think Ye is the most used word in the Bible, where it means toi", West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the one", to Ye -- the reflection of good, bad, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.
West isn't the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, also played on the d union and uppercase.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly 50 years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he will never use military force to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for research in this area, according to AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several US government actors made announcements related to AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the US.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
 Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries are way ahead of the US, and we're looking for the next big AI breakthrough, says Lee.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next key step in the AI field will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player. He later joined the management team of Microsoft Reasearch and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held, in order to identify visionaries.
Lee says that American researchers often have to work hard to get government funding.
 It is not China that is taking over academic leaders, it is the corporations, says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited top academics to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support US efforts on IDA.
 I think that green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers , he says.
The State Council of China unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, as do the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, which give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, involving partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
In parallel, the US legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians take part in referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining the minimum 50% turnout required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was:  Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece? 
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which saw 66% of registered voters.
 I came to vote for my children.  Our place is in Europe, says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change to open the vote for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and seating in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
 We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door , said Kavadarkov.
 We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments.
I think a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO, said Mr Zaev after submitting his ballot.
He added that a  yes  would be a  confirmation of our future .
According to a poll released on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would be willing to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected turnout rate.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70 per cent of those intending to vote said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 percent of the vote plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before he went down the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before dismissing the others just outside Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet, Pep Guardiola, the team's coach, told reporters.
We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial lead in the Premier League game,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball straight on the Brighton field.
He sent him to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Skyblues forward sent the ball into the net just before it slipped off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the party-turner against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of a playoff for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West.
The Rockies took a 5-2 lead over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their division title.
Even if this game is not a big deal, we want to step on the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level that I'll have to face this year.
Why wouldn 't I want to participate ?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they'd be inclined to give Scherzer the spot, in this situation.
Scherzer, who's 34th start, will be in training Thursday and will pitch on his usual day off on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's speeches in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation that his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court generated when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
 All our actions will have an impact in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
"I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever, and that's why I'm fighting on all fronts for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they're determined to take power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
"You can see it in the last four days", he said, before calling the Democrats "angry, mean and lying people".
He mentioned the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public scolding.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you release the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. lt was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it once was.
It is intolerant of those who express their views
When activists from the Momentum movement in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said:  We want the rally to be inclusive and productive. 
That's exactly what Friday night general meetings were like during my eight years as a Labour MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the case at many meetings today, and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if it has ever been taken into consideration.
It has become clear that opposing views are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on its acceptability by the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared a political vision began to expect me to turn my back on my beliefs and take positions that were the opposite of my own, whether it was on national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive rant on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I received were political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist talk every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the normalisation of different forms of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party must encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that big community and the party is shrinking with motions of no confidence and changes to the selection rules.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years: keep your eyes down, don't express your ideas so loudly, and everything will be fine.
But I'm not in politics to do that.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the negligence of the Thatcher government had caused my classroom to collapse.Since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my differences with the current party leadership.
All I'd like to say to those who supported the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services, and I don't think this is the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me from acting for the causes I stand for, which are in your interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for the constituency of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose , Ayr is undefeated
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day's play in the Scottish Rugby Championship.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defense and the way they seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the scoring.
"We have been tested so far, but we are undefeated, so I must consider myself happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose congratulated Ayr:  Bravo them, they were more effective than us and were able to seize the opportunities. 
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute shot, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak.
Climo made matters worse for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at half-time, he scored and turned a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
Melrose started the second half well and Baggot's conversion of Patrick Anderson narrowed the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, was then given a yellow card and again Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed try by Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team took over and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, from the penalty spot, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's progressive basket.
Climo turned the test around, as he has done almost every time since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home try.
The star of Still Game is going into the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to pursue a career in catering, and the comedian was appointed manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his long-time stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's finale, and Kiernan seems to be gearing up for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving restaurant scene in Glasgow.
 The sea is ours : blocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in an armored boat at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the following motorcycle:  The sea is right back at us.
It's a duty to get it back.
Across the blockaded Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
 Bolivia has the will, the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome,  explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim.Bolivia wants Chile to negotiate an agreement for a sovereign ocean passage to Bolivia after decades of sporadic negotiations.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for reelection next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean", he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Chile and that little will change, even if the decision is positive.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chile territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice issued its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case  was not complicated , explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from helping Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt it.
 The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has undermined all the goodwill left in Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to organise talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia  an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile  and a chance to end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements , he said.
Calzadilla also disputed that Morales - who remains to this day one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
 Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
 The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past. 
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
The European Union is committed to the implementation of the UN Charter.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He made the remarks at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy in the stalemate more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is "chymical" to think that maintaining sanctions and opposing a declaration that will end the Korean War will make the North bow.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of prior meaningful disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang's decision to give up an arsenal that it regards as the only guarantee of its security is debatable.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest headgear trends, perhaps soon to be available in your stores
If you want to add XXL to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their delirious oversize hat collections at a PE19 fashion show that celebrated the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Increasingly fancy hats have been flooding Instagram this summer, and designers have decided to incorporate their wacky pieces into the shows.
Valentino's flagship was an eccentric beige hat with a wide brim that evoked a feather, which swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included jewelled watermelons, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of original masks, just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had lips sewn and were more like Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creature resembled a diving kit, with a tube and glasses, while another resembled a cone of melted ice.
And if you're following the fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to fashion watchers, the big hats could be found on your shopping streets.
XXL hats follow in the footsteps of the Bomba, the wide-brimmed straw hat that stars rip off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that has flooded social media has unveiled another of its flagship designs on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus's PE19 La Riviera show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL:  I'm looking forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags coming to stores next summer.  The designer has so impressed the minds that it's obvious there will be a demand for oversize accessories. 
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a record of academic excellence, a trend which continued in 2018 with new excellent test results reinforced by collective and individual achievement in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said:  If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are speaking to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in the examinations this year, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of pupils achieved the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did 72% of pupils who studied German, 69% of pupils who studied French and 63% of pupils who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an absolutely essential skill for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organised alongside science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates are linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future from this lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically put the multilingual person ahead of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 UK adults, 75% of them did not have sufficient command of a foreign language to hold a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, particularly those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country.
Modern languages should be considered as  international communication skills .
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' head coach, announced that James will play Sunday in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one, less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule.
 At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to be ready. 
Trump's campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops are planned, particularly in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular.
With the confirmation vote for the vacant Supreme Court seat postponed, Trump is seeking to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do I watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow him online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week, and the Senate confirmation vote for Kavanaugh is expected to be delayed until a week into the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily about helping the Republicans gain ground in the run-up to the November election.
According to Reuters, the US president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.
 Control of Congress is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign, a spokesman for the Trump team, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media attention in Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is coming to try to get him back in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight for hope as Sunday's singles draws near
After three singles, Saturday afternoon's four-way could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swinging movement of the moose is a sporting concept invented from scratch but in which the players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments like this.
Where would they find the moose now?
"They were leading by six points and now four, so that gives us a little bit of wings", said Jordan Spieth as he headed back for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points to go and 12 more to play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel a bit windy and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of each having scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been terribly effective from tee to green and is setting an example.
The energetic cheers intensified as his play progressed, with a crucial putt allowing him to tie in the fourth half as he and Thomas were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, which won the game on the 15th hole, has caused a similar outcry from those who tell you he believes the American team is still in the race.
"You really have to stay determined and focus on your game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the history of the Ryder Cup testifies.
The strange but adorable European pair have won four out of four matches and have no right to make a mistake.
Not only were  Moliwood  the only ones not to do a bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the raving crowd, they're the players to beat on Sunday, and there's no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to capture a potential European victory as the sun sets on Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's foosball, as he teamed with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
But on Sundays, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and what they don't give, and how a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and made a considerable headway on the final day, but this foursome session also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which was doubted by some, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a strong lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's four-ball and foursome.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods in distress, giving them four points so far.
Determined to retain the title they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made a difference by winning 3-1 in the morning's fours, against a disorderly American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a disappointing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball, they beat the pair of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and an already tired Woods by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who was out for both games on Saturday, has had a few good starts, but he's now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning's fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning the 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared in the tournament, which took place in the southwest of Paris in cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, the latter having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had to tie the game to retain the trophy.
After being runners-up for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament can never be done unilaterally without trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions reinforced his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken important goodwill measures last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
 However, we see no corresponding response from the United States 
If there is no confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, we cannot be the first to unilaterally disarm.
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticisms of Washington's opposition to a phased approach to denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, his statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made on June 12 in Singapore at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to ease the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea denuclearize first and intensifies pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of end of war".
Those who think that these sanctions can make us cringe don't know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our suspicion. 
Ri made no comment on the second Kim-Trump summit highlighted at the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding:  If the party concerned with denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock. 
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at North American territory after the evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened at the UN last year to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim's courage in implementing disarmament measures this year, but added that there was still much to do and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that "no deadline has been set". "It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday that:  The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, final and verified denuclearisation. 
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea denounced his  gangster methods .
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the US took equivalent action.
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a break from school
This year, Harvard University has launched a new course that allows all undergraduates to get more sleep and fights the growing male-dominated trend of studying with caffeine all night.
One professor noticed that most students at the best university in the world don't know how to take care of themselves
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that he came up with the idea.
At the end, a student came up to me and said, "Why do you only tell me this in the last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, teaches students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, said the university decided to introduce the course after noticing that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One section presents an image of a dormitory containing various objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books, etc.) which students click on to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
 We know that this will not change students' behaviour instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know this information - just as you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,  added Professor Czeisler.
He says that the culture of pride in staying up late is still there, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be the secret weapon of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, leaving them permanently hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had led him to insist that it be offered throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar programme of study before joining the reputed institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students have an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythms and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men off the field
The Rangers suffered another blow away, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed Livingston team to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's side had hoped to record their first away win since their 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard with his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side adrift, eight points behind Ladbroke Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers, short of inspiration, failed to tie the game.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston are moving up to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And more difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury from a throw from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, chose the same Livi 11 that took a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team smothering its opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored two minutes into the game, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot in the direction of Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their play in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been awarded a penalty after the free kick when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only got two shots in the first period, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike from Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's 34th-minute opening goal was against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it through their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to score on Jacobs' stolen kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard responded at half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the trade almost had an immediate impact when the winger came up to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston still continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last moments, but McGregor managed to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a late game penalty as he struggled with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the computer was turning... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger meter.
A mainstay of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: What is that ?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
These headphones can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity. 
It's going to be a big jump.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to detect cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to detect and kill cancer cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then detect a protein that is common to many cancers and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine is showing encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which is designed to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and then re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
According to Dr. Berzofsky, the HER2 protein  leads to the growth of several types of cancer , including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, involving the harvesting of immune cells to train them to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
In a MAGA hat, Kanye West has embarked on a pro-Trump rant after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West has been a sensation on the set after a wild performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live and announced that he will run for president in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang while wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took a crack at Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
 I often talk to white people and they say:  How can you like Trump? He's a racist! 
"Well, if racism was my concern, I would have left America long ago", he said.
SNL started with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had spent a bad 15 minutes backstage because of his cap.
They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They pressured me !
And then they say I'm in a hole, he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see it, the abyss?" and stated that he would wear his Superman cape, because no one can dictate what he does.
Try love.
His comments drew at least two howls from the audience, and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reports.  A deathly silence fell over the entire set, a person at the scene told the magazine. 
West had been called in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West has baffled a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative Group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted:  To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR BEING TENU TO THE FOLLOW. 
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply true to himself, and that's absolutely wonderful.
 However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying their music, clothes or supporting their art) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
And we too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and of course the legendary late Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: attempted murder charge after assault with a deadly weapon in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death last Friday in a restaurant in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is due to appear in Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, is taking on toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is caught up in the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to pose as tough to get respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something was wrong and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, said he was "very determined" to tackle the issue.
 Personally, I deeply believe that we have mismanaged masculinity. 
What lessons have we taught young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem now facing us?
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He went on:  What behavior is innate, what behavior has been instilled?
What do television and the street teach young boys that they have to behave like this to be a man?
I think that's really one of the fundamental questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Something's obviously wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prologues or sequels when the series ended next summer, claiming that he was done with Battlefields and Horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his thieving brother.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life", he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland at Leslie's family estate.
HIV / AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the cases were contracted during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country following transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of HIV-positive people with AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee leaked data on senators, and denounces dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were backed by experts and right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies, and more shameful lies", Waters tweeted.
It appears that the leaked information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after all three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office and have leaked the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters,  this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie .
 The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information .
 This false allegation is completely false and a real lie. 
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
"This denial is anger", he wrote.
This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
She mustn't be provocative.
She must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
 If it's true, it's huge , he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted  the relevant law enforcement authorities and services  about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are exposed", she added, "and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team".
Johnny English has struck again, a parody of Rowan Atkinson, the under-achieving spy.
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this remake of the action comedy Johnny English, which debuted in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the Return.
Will the ironic self-satire about the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity for our country?
In any case, the uncompetent Johnny English, with his eyes splattered and his face rubbery, has had his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - a name which indicates above all that he is a great comic creation designed for a non-English speaking film audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a little note in Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was also inspired by the traveller and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving the chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although the humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when serious comedies like 007 and Mission Impossible confidently compose themselves with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me, Johnny English's wild misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson's silent film gags in the Bean character.
The premise that is always relevant is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the operatives on duty - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for a prime minister who is a pompous figure on the brink of crisis and already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there's not much to put under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she'll have to bring someone out of retirement.
That means you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a fancy establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice pranks here, because English runs a Rock Academy-style spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his longtime partner, again camped out by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are causing trouble for Her Majesty's Secret Service, get back in the game and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful and fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the thumb of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of farcical pranks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking aboard Volta's luxury sailboat; and English unleashes anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality headset, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are secured for this last shot, but still, there's a lot of kids in it.
It's a rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really bring out her talent?
The Labour Party denies having devised a plan for the British to work four days but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week - but be paid for five.
Apparently the party wants business leaders to give workers the benefits of the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still receiving the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic programme and plans to orient the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times:  A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year. 
 This will not be done overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party pledged a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said:  A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party. 
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell has expressed his determination to take back power from the hands of the anonymous directors and profiteers in the public utility companies.
The acting Chancellor's plans also foresee that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire stake as the Labour government may make deductions due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into company boards and to create an inclusive shareholder fund which will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will receive up to £500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy confide in 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has been delayed by at least a week following the FBI investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
However, Graham's vote seems to be set in stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and we need an explosive charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the people she's named haven't been able to verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don't see anything new that changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission: to end global poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or doing any other useful effort to raise awareness about the fight against poverty.
But how far can the Global Citizen organization still reach its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of clicktivism - a situation where people really think they're making a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded over 19 million shares from its supporters, who are advocating for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to inspire world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and implementers who have pledged to help children develop their full potential, while also pledging £35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
 With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history , said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition programme, to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the launch of more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, what makes you think that it is possible to end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen said:  The road to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
US could use the Navy to create a blockade to impede Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
To prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington may, if necessary, call on the US Navy, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for it to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe", he would have said.
According to the official, there are ways to remedy this.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct them to ensure that their energy is not put on the market", he added.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation which describes itself as the spokesperson for energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in fact identical.
 As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less to exploit and replace fuels, he said, referring to Russia as having more than one rope in its bow with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has pledged to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is making Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and constitutes an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said: "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers".
The United States' position has been met with negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
 After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for President. 
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58% of the likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 per cent were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick had more support, with 38 percent in favour of a potential campaign and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democratic names mentioned for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks about Track Palin's PTSD during the rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in connection with a domestic violence incident.
What my own son is going through right now, what he's going through coming home, I can relate to other families who are going through the aftermath of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with, she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a taboo subject and said about his son and other veterans that they're coming back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the Air Force, and every other military, have given to the country.
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 States and the District of Columbia in favour of a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a court challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the District filed a motion in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case brought in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner and her sons, who are members of violent gangs, had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
 The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle , stated in his memo the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary work.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
 Asylum is granted to people who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear on grounds of race, creed, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions,  said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on 11 June.
 Asylum was never designed to alleviate all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world. 
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting more and more dramatic.
 I feel very tense , said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center in the empty city.
Every second, an ambulance is bringing bodies back.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, collecting wet goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulders, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the powerful earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of intimidation through propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the additional fee paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation China denies.
By accusing Beijing of trying to meddle in the US election, Trump marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, is doubling down on its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.
 In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, writes Branstad.
 On the other hand, at the Beijing press box, you will find few protesting voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media firmly obeys the Chinese Communist Party, he writes. 
He added that one of China's leading newspapers avoided publishing his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating voters as the midterm elections approach because of the Kavanaugh debacle.
While many senior Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, particularly among women, could emerge during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published in The Hill on September 29, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said that "there is no going back".
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm voter anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow, not in November", she said on September 28 according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, reports Mic, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate aisle as Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to push forward Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
 Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of proportion, said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban women voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote. 
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction might be strong if Republicans pushed for confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week that it has become a confusing mess for the GOP.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it's not just about the nomination of Kavanaugh, it's about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the television news.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem divided about the credibility of both parties, with a small majority leaning in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of those polled believed Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were students at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee's free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is authorised to access this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aiming to dominate the world.
"We have to do it now", he said about the launch.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal data store online or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time on one browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this personal responsibility via data.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not yet in discussions with  Facebook and Google  about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upended in an instant.
 We don't ask their permission. 
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that the mission of [dInrupt] is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem with the goal of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
 I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web , added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, however, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was brilliantly symbolic to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the St Quentin Canal through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later he rushed to the line of fire and, with the greatest bravery, led the line before blowing up a field gun on his own and knocking out three soldiers from the detachment.
On 4 October 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were  something I will never be able to live up to, but that makes me humble .
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him.
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, and instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you spent the whole night watching a loaded Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main screen, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy that they had stayed up until the early hours of the morning, especially for the battle.
A Twitter fan described the move to the children's cartoon as  sort of a bad joke .
Regarding the broadcast, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said that government regulations say that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's shows.
"Peppa the pig", yeah.
Scott Coker, the chairman of Bellator, said they were working on their programme to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution", Coker said.
 However, it is six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages going both ways and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you that won't happen next time.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give more for the fans and we blew it.
This is a regrettable situation.
Tom Daley felt  inferior  sexually
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like me.
On the first Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to her illness.
Appearing as a shipwrecked man in the first episode of Laverne, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said:  Even today, those feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength I needed to succeed. 
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was something, he continued.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist is now a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give hope back to others.
The three-time world champion said he did not expect to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years her senior, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
When one sees so much at such a young age - he competed in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he confides that it is difficult to find someone of his age who has experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have thought that I would have won a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
Her son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you're not going to be in the front row anymore", he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and die before I finally realized he was not invincible", he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was everything I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's nothing better", he said.

Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back on his feet to avoid an unfortunate stint.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biennial competition for a record twelfth time, was dismissed by captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's four-ball and foursome.
Instead of being in the thick of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time world champion has split his day between the role of supporting and tweaking his game in the stands in an effort to remedy his ailments.
He was never the greatest of the leaders, even at the peak of his career. At 48, he is not the most suited for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes misses.
And as if the course wasn't scary enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, is up against Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, at four downs in the first 12 games of the singles, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I didn't expect more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun competing with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's doing a lot more than just playing.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not insignificant lead before the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult course.
The Danish played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually climbed to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep remembering that we were leading by a wide margin in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won but with accuracy", said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Rankings win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at Golf National to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and to every member of this team that this is not the end.
Go all the way tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until we get the points on the board.
We have one goal, which is to try and win this trophy, and that's what we have to stay focused on.
I've always said I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's happening on the other side - they're the best players in the world.
Pleased with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added:  I would never go further on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be presented and it's different.
It's great to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're being tested to the fullest extent of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message to the players, to bring out the best in you tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go out and get the best of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of the reversal on the final day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing at the Miracle of Medina, where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had managed to rally his players on the final day.
We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you'd like to take this quick leave like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We've established our lineup accordingly and put the guys in the way we thought we should, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
I followed this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course, said Bjorn about his singles selections.
Germany's new warship still delayed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the  Rheinland-Pfalz , the flagship of the newly-launched frigates of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubling issues that arose after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships - which should enable Germany to project its power overseas - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for this return were not well known, but German media mentioned a number of  software and hardware defects  that rendered the warship useless in case of deployment on combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, which is half the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to weigh twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached an astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared with 2.2 billion at the start.
The problems of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the navy is actually running out of ships capable of deploying.
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust is keeping a close eye on the bat's secret life
New research in a region of the Scottish Highlands is seeking to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
The study by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using portable detectors.
Professional sound analysis will help to determine the frequency of bat calls and the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be drawn up to give a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territorial level.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how these are used by each of these species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work which affects their perch and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Responsible for the protection of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct excavations, inspections at the perch and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a perfect place for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there's still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive. 
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before any property maintenance, as the accidental destruction of a single nest can result in the death of 400 females and young, or the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, urged the public to help.
She said:  We still have a lot to learn about our bats and with regards to many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations at the moment. 
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him  false information , and claimed that people  want to make themselves known  by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then paid her 375,000 dollars to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, called the news  false information .
 No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to get publicity using my name.
That's the way it is.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, "the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have called "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for moral damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's bedroom, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him he was a "99% good guy" but that he didn't know what was going on with the remaining 1%.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had turned herself in to the police and that pictures of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt terrified of reprisals and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement, as she remains traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would forever regret the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the UK would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need an agreement", said Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Burnaston director.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how crossborder trade works.
For example, BMW has indicated that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what carmakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run in  tight flow , parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-built vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be halted.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that will allow us, as I said, not only to enjoy the success we have but also to seize the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains. 
While Toyota was not able to specify for how long production would be halted, it did warn that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union coordinator at the factory who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly worried:  In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back. 
A government spokesman said:  We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU. 
The White House announces that the Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back a week while the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel charged with investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been a rumour in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House, when he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has indicated that he would prefer not to fire Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that witnessed Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said:  No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if we push it back another week given all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed.
The statement would be disputed by some journalists: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion to demagogic TV reporters, although she did say: "I have nothing against them blowing up the gallery".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that  the President attends more Q&A sessions than any other President before him :  We have checked the numbers. 
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to question the president of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this frequently, you've seen it in the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
He rarely gives solo press conferences there.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual and at times bizarre appearance to the assembled press.
On the fears of Brexit, the Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applying for status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter:  During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of no deal.
I understand this must be a very troubling time for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State's Sselon Mike Organ, Tennessee Tigers second baseman Christion Abercrombie, has been rushed to the hospital after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the touchline and collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for another examination.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had emerged from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was no further information on the type or extent of the injury and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore student-athlete, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before being out of the game, bringing his season total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative schemes.
This measure will undo the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will go to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by pledging to provide more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to £120 million a year.
Around 13% of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and prevents newcomers from making a place for themselves in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become  ghost towns  because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping property prices high by seizing land without using it, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to tackle the UK's housing scandal.
Mr Corbyn has put forward an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including rent control and the abolition of wrongful evictions.
It also wants to give councils more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said:  Last year, I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do that, we need to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy a home as it is for hardworking UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become a distant one and the plight of the homeless remains too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross explains that his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is delighted to take on the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in Ligue 1, three points behind the leader.
He joined Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I've been selected for Division B and that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland's games in Hampden with my dad and it's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would only come if I succeeded in managing the club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he has not hesitated to join such iconic names at such a big club, having already turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question, can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
"The club is a Premier League club, without a doubt, because of the structure and infrastructure of the club", he added.
It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably only consider myself a success here if I could get the club back there.
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa back from relegation to the third tier and turned St Mirren, who were on the verge of relegation, into the championship winner the following season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalls that taking over Alloa was probably a real crossroads.
I really thought being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I've done well, I've made a good living and I've enjoyed some considerable summits.
But sometimes playing is hard.
There's a lot of details to be worked out every week.
I'm still experiencing this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is very good for me.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever been in my entire adult life.
The full interview is available on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12pm and 1pm BST.
According to one poll, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat has boosted the revenues of struggling pubs in Britain, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy firm CGA, which compiled the data, said:  The constant sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July followed the pattern of June, when bars had seen a 2.8% rise, except for restaurants, which suffered an even bigger shock.
The decline of 1.8% in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcoholic beverages are by far the most popular, with more similarities than restaurants.
Food stores have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, drinks sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food sales decreased by 3%. 
Paul Newman, a specialist in leisure and hospitality at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales on the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales of 4.8% on average per year is particularly painful, in addition to the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have been less opportune for food producers and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved respite. 
The total increase in pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in establishment.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children - some as young as 11 - has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Insta pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of pupils reported having a  main  account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in  fake Insta accounts  - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported maintaining a cleaned main account to show to their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who happened to be on her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenager who was inciting others to rape me.
According to a study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have a double profile, with half of pupils admitting to having private accounts.
CSM leader Mike Buchanan said:  It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers cannot find them. 
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and Chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sport leaders to draw on his extensive experience gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is held in immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from his participation on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said:  I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I want to be able to really contribute and lead this sport in Scotland. 
The American, who won the 200m and 400m events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted:  A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a hard job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
An online advertisement comparing mothers and cows divides opinion
An online advertisement by a company offering a milk drawer compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is being called the world's first silent milkman, Elvie, a consumer technology company, has launched a bold music video-inspired ad to show the freedom its new milkman offers to breastfeeding women.
In a haystack full of cows, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm playing myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these are my breasts, not breasts".
The chorus goes on:  Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help women who are milking. 
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
 A worse decision than using cows to promote the product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days after they are born, one of them wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented:  This is an understandable trauma for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who are babysitting?
Someone else added:  Such a disconnected advertisement. 
Others defended the advertisement, such as one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
I think it's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercials are a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
"This is a great product", someone wrote.
Someone else commented:  It's a fun commercial for moms who are sucking their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like  cows .
This is not an advertisement praising the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet milkshakes hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk drawer say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie is completely silent, without wires or pipes and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go outside while sucking their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented:  The Elvie milkshake is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while at the same time expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new milk drawer will provide.
This isn't the first time the milkman Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children with respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by rescuing a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their households would be required to submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
 Nearly 80% of the people who are respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to prosecute these people, said Mr Albence.
According to shelter advocates, in order to speed up the process of the children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some children to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible will be promptly expelled.
According to the respondents and reports submitted by the shelter network in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
In a facility as large as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many find difficult to deal with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they would be dealt with accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and without conditions, he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to wage this holy battle until all Syrian territory was purged of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has over 1,000 troops.
Moualem said that the conditions for refugees were favourable for their return, and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational concerns that discouraged refugees from returning.
 We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to ensure that these returns are facilitated , he said.
 They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue. 
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end this war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale assault on the province, home to three million people, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for  precise deadlines  and expressed the hope that the military measures would target the jihadists, especially the Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who  will be eliminated .
Staffan de Mistura, UN representative, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work should be limited to revising the articles of the current constitution, and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave the presidency prematurely.
What would be arguably the most spectacular end to a presidency!
At this moment, the audience shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers at prime time, is the number one cable channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand", commented Neal Baer, host of ABC's drama series Designated Survivor, about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And Some Undeniable Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,' said Mrs Scovell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, unlike anything that happens on television, the scenarios in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the richest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used a profound expertise for his book Fear, on Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a garment filled with pride according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' extravagant descriptions of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
As for me, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If some of what he does feels like watching a reality TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's changing teams and daily situation twists (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 90 degrees at his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was leaning inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money floods the closest midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is flooded with money, thanks to a re-alignment of congressional districts that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This recently restructured Pittsburgh suburban district is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district sparked a clash over campaign financing between the major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCDC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb has become a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory last March in a very popular special election in Pennsylvania 's 18th Congressional District .
This seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists gave the Democrats a slight lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not object to.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization management.
State Department officials have decided to summon the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest their recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only foreseen against El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in 2017 in aid, including for drug control and development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were ongoing, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate which were described by the three US dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying the history
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable to that body as he prepares to represent himself before voters and, perhaps, a jury of his peers.
There are many such cases, and I am not saying that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West would stand up and push back the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divisions.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation led by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the paper reported that he offered to secretly record the president last year and speculated that he was unfit to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
What will we say if the investigation recently requested from the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which had previously occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy, I cannot help but be optimistic about our future.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienne on Thursday, but the victory over Austria, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
"It was a positive for us, because Villarreal is a quality team", the 31-year-old forward commented.
We went into the game thinking we were going to get something and we came away with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result in their last match, nevertheless I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really tough, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there's a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are having a lot of fun; the training is good.
Let's hope we can move on now, leave last season behind and triumph.
Women are losing sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings.
Although the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
Almost half of those who participated in the national survey said they talked to their spouse about the cost of longterm care.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
People want a family member to care for them, but they don't do the necessary things to have that conversation, said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Tell your spouse and children that you cannot prepare your family for your own care if you do not tell them your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your financial adviser can also help you to establish a way to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions on financing longterm care may include a traditional longterm care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a repurchase value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your estate - provided you can afford to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles along the way.
Provide a healthcare proxy that will allow you to appoint a trusted person to check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who would make financial decisions for you and see to it that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think of the little details: Suppose your elderly relative has a medical emergency and has to go to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
 It's not just the finances that are at stake, but also who the doctors are? , asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who 's gonna take care of the dog ?
Put this plan into place.
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe

The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the incident, which occurred around 2:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were paralyzed, emergency services could not receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and particularly of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also a major activity in the province, but is mainly located in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on 26 December off the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the province of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Significant earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Center and is being held on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading not guilty, that's for sure, when his plea was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face a prison sentence of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Her partner claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the toll of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and a cyclist on its route last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to provide evidence that Saipov intentionally murdered the eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after that assault, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one for violent crimes and vehicle destruction.
The attack required "careful preparation and premeditation", prosecutors said, calling Saipov's method "abominable, cruel and depraved".
 Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco , the statement of intent states.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not sought the death penalty in a lawsuit for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiring and spying for the Soviet Union in the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities that he was prompted to commit the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilty and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole can only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilise the People's Army at a demonstration at the Conservative conference today.
The former UK Independence Party MP said politicians should feel the pressure from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative MP for Backben Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would have been free already if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been highlighted by Remain Conservatives who have joined an isolated anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay and from the EU.
The allies stressed that she would continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her programme and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by now", he said.
The member for Wellingborough added:  I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers. 
He said: "We have not engaged in world wars to submit.
We wish to make our own laws in our own country. 
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote:  The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false. 
The Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who is in favour of leaving, was also present at the march to tell the journalists:  I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not liked by the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and so will our party and our activists who are walking the streets and getting us elected first.
Drop the Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. 
Farage told the rally that politicians should be made to "feel the pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are telling them today:  We will not let you get away with it .
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd:  I wish you would feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has allowed us to win the Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Conservative anti-Brexit banners after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues surrounding the party's application at the start of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put the computer systems and all the technology in place for Canada, plus for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future Saturday at a public meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent voice critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP's state representative, who was co-chairman in 2016 for Trump's Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public meeting since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which means having a woman at the head of the state.
Arrested in the shooting death of Louisiana State University Sims
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department participated in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. today.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who appeared in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
 Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,  Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a firearm, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-4 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading for the world title after team guidelines allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became apparent from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and cornered Hamilton as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to head into the turmoil at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the pits one lap later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the interior at the risk of resisting after a double attempt at defence in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally made it into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job getting a one-two, Hamilton said.
That was very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not released Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that the events unfolding in the Senate showed that people were  mean, disgusting and dishonest .
"The only thing that could happen and the only good thing that's happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
They see the leaks and the leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember ?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak any information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't give anything away".
Well, wait a minute.
"We have not disclosed any information", he added, referring to the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not divulge his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential like she asked.
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the rally:  I'll tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using these allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means.
You see the wickedness, the meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the rest of the league
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have erased their Friday Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 home game in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead back.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing them the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being caught up.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer took the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan resumed the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt served Cownie at 15:16 with a tie.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening near the end of the first period.
The local team rallied and Bouchard once again tied with a goal giving them a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, securing his team's victory by scoring a fifth goal midway through.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died while helping hundreds of people on board a plane escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to devastate the area and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained on the ground to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower when he sensed it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The toll is expected to continue to rise as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves measuring up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News:  Every minute, an ambulance is bringing bodies home.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian President, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military:  I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has gone missing after a plane crashed into the lagoon.
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing after all 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it has been unable to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane had come too low.
"That's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slip into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He claimed the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy claimed that sailors working nearby improving a pier had also assisted in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case on Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' house when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk.
Sanford appeared in court Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's texts, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its hearings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury later today.
What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imbuing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The band wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message sent by mistake from the mother who complained that she was  still a Black .
The couple denies being racist, and liken the lawsuits to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay when she found out in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"A woman is still black", Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Madame Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his oversight,  uncomfortable , Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was rather expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, then driven home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and is claiming $350 a day for the six-month homework she was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want them to understand, look, we don't do this kind of thing", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing they would not be able to trust him after they had wronged him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn ?
Let 's see .
Plasco said that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a very delicate situation.
Would you prosecute someone like that?
"It's not a very pleasant thing to do", the business banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors were afraid readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter:  It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success.
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had taken a "bitter-sweet" flavor after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a very important member of our family, and adds that her father was very proud of his eventual success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a cocky man", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of him, even if it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his own creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself. 
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to be this good", Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors had given him to keep his heart rate up was slowly running out and leaving his system.
She died a while ago and it all stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not caring about the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I'd bow my head and cry all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women leave postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted on a Welsh bridge postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any of my relatives to feel what I'm forced to feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile would light up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was reunited with his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said:  I am constantly concerned that there is a train effect. 
Mrs. Davis created the cards to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep quiet - you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have any eye contact with them or anything.
She said that her death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get over it:  It's heartbreaking for the family.
It's ruining us.
But we all have to go forward and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the line as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a time-limited investigation, limited in its scope - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would collapse into a partisan stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are not five weeks away, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not score well, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We don't know yet if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to go ahead with the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: number of defectors falling under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said that 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the so far pending denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in broad outlines, to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress since then on US sanctions.
 Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, we cannot be the first to carry out unilateral disarmament,  said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have called her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screamed and choked when he mentioned his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated assassination" by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against Democrats.
"I think he's discrediting himself with these statements and the way he's taking on the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he's also unfit to sit on the court where he's sitting now", Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the question of possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
'This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and wait for us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'' said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs Steinem said 45 years later.
I don't think that's uncommon, do you?
I was helped considerably by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most striking memories of my first job, in a male-dominated office, where I found myself one day crying with an inexpressible rage, was being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold-hearted manager who had always scared me a little - who dragged me down a flight of stairs.
"Don't let them see you crying", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They're sad because you're sad, but they're happy because you're sad.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and had retired from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she confided to me, laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the running, and the last thing they needed was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was very advanced, she was late in raising funds, and so she vowed that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave men $1,000 were only planning to give her $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt dizzy.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Ms Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they were going to put on my headstone.
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first waves of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs on goods worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the US.
Each time, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will falter anytime soon.
To push Washington back is to yield to demands, but to publicly yield to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its part properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
 The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously recognized, Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is  prepared  for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
 Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing the rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, drilled his opening shot into the water at the 16th hole in the par-3 standings, giving up his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, which was first held in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the lowest placed player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World's greatest golfer, Dustin Johnson, has gone 2-1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the all-time European champion with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it, said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to fellow American John Ram who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup play.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the USA commented after a disappointing performance for his team:  I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're gonna get together, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow.
We've been overtaken by the other team.
Red tide news: Concentrations are falling in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - leading to concerns of decreasing concentrations.
The red tide covers about 130 miles (209 km) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
We're finding islets about 10 miles off Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations in or off Sarasota County, average concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in and off Lee County, high concentrations in or off Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, and the rest of the state.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
