Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mistaken institution where young people should meet today.
A crypt chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners cultivated the former ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to the day.
It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get upset, because the car of the Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but for this very reason very informative.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called primordial position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria ’ s first survey.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison earlier / today is most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as Munich district.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses in Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered land pieces from the so-called "original recording", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt in the area of the present-day district of Haidhausen one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
The Munich Circle of Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there in 1858 / 59.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called madmen.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has dealt with the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients had been first place, later was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
The Isar Amper Hospital Munich East, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatry, has been located there since 2006.
Young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.
West lies the football field of TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children ’ s house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural style following the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during bombing attacks during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as "Haupt Platz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs broke many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval crypt chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work took place and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri because of the state ’ s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," says the group's statement.
A recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for people to take action against discrimination, as well as the state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black Tennessee man.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state are more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring deposit money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state in 16th place in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary
The Fischerbacher pasture fence is a success project and will be continued next year.
The CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.
At the Right-Graben Court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU Local Association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his company, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, the "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt "elementary important".
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much needs to be worked on with the motorsense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography", stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bio-farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekts and is glad about the Leader's support".
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced into the fence.
This means that the area is 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was supported by leaders, a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
The farmers therefore had to invest 12 610 euros in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fences.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Also for Peter Weiß it was clear: "Here best food is produced".
The Landscape Flemish Court (LPR) Baden Württemberg enables the state support of willow fences.
The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.
A prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor set designated by the LPR.
Furthermore, the area to be fenced must not be tractor manageable (slope inclination above 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The application for the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The disclosure area is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime's change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence Saddam Hussein ’ s carefully staged fall on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump ’ s key ideologists, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the President ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta insulted: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable descent of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome to Trump ’ s US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical figurative representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but rather was an early neoconservative who brought the American flame into the night world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "
Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something encountered.
The meaning of the statue is completely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
The real aim is to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not illuminate the way, but kindle hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Director Neil Black says that the 16 Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that athletics in the United Kingdom must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find it out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are candidates for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in was great. "
The Commonwealth ’ s silver medal winner, who will compete at her fifth World Championships in the 400 metres hurdles, says that it is “incredible ” that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s so far best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir is on this path and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I have just said that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a Home World Cup.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don ’ t get around a public office if you can ’ t tolerate heating voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn ’ t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded criticism, certainly.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will be led like sheep to slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week.
The governor ’ s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with “Well, and? ”.
“It ’ s just Facebook, ” many people said.
But it is important.
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict observance of the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - who is a public forum, which is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax Dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news program "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea either, when a number of people comment on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and are not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".
What the governor ’ s employees called the “concentrated spam offensive ” would probably call others“ intercession. ”
Facebook ’ s era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it was in previous times to have done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But this is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter ’ s users who have been blocked by his Twitter ’ s Feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers beat his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are at the heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led links next door in the Archerfield to the final round, before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it achieved its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is an eager supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said Southport's native player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad how it went. "
With the trio on the field are former Masters Champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking.
This is the result of a study by scientists from the Hamburg University Hospital (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer are due to passive smoking per year," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", says the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than assumed, since much is hidden underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction works, is a major problem for the construction team of Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barrier grids is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken and swallowed up with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 5 pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote before the occupying forces by a public hangar.
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua and New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is barren. The trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car.
There are no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated metal roofs transformed by rust into various yellowish tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans venerated a god called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined gold and copper worth US $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated US $78 billion.
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military keeps a suffocating presence.
An investigation in the New York Times in 2005 reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal highlands in the 1970 ’ s became genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is stated in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of previous year's atrocities, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's premier Human Rights Watch researcher.
The screws have intensified as Papua ’ s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Maintenance and Canteens sell fried chicken and Gado's Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to keep up here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai Local who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has tasted the native Papua - the Mama and Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on their way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and nowadays the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, making sacrifices and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16 year old Yulianus Yeimo, was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita Dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago.
Some demonstrators started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, the soldiers were sent an order over an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was listening in the mood.
"When I turned, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was witness to the executions.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police Department, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman for the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta on the following day.
Three weeks Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical ills in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence referendum of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I am afraid of being arrested by the military, I am afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, Ravianus Douw, 24 years old, who had drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company ’ s office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29 year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of concern for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained on the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here cultivate everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the more educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua seldom have the capital or the skills necessary to conduct its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, the promises made by Jokowi ’ s election campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa's refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shootout.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group ’ s accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases. ”
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai firing," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai is in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai are looking at people like other Papua, their voice for Jokowi as a "fault" that he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai firing victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never be given justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee the 79 storey building, 337 metres high.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch's Tower (torch's tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, ” said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled down the building at around 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. GMT).
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of Torch ’ s building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from cladding, exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believed that the system of plates for isolation and cladding on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Championship reform: Continue Best Championship of five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed at the General Assembly with his large Davis Championship Cup.
At the meeting in Ho and Chi and Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis and Cup singles only on two wins was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five sets of classics, which are often very long but therefore also very valued, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member states voted in favour of the reform, so ITF president David Haggerty ’ s goal was scarcely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, it was not until the vote that the proposal had already come before to carry out the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: In the following year, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the plane, find out a survey
A survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously forbidden items were smuggling past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally forbidden knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they had discovered belatedly that they had gone mistakenly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey among more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they had knowingly carried objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It is no surprise that the people who most likely wear smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest number of objects seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care: Tens of thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far failed that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla ’ s CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different, less brilliant figure when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: those of cancellations on the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay a full refund of the €1000 (US $1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "Reservation Payment".
At present, 455,000 such non-binding reservations would be available, according to Musk in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it should be 500,000 - all models combined -, one million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If there are major delays, however, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA ’ s chief Pruitt withdraws to reduce emissions due to delay of Obama ’ s rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama ’ s era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone on 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year in order to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma ’ s prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the recent legal setback for the Pruit ’ s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the EPO ’ s administrator had exceeded his authority when he sought to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama Administration, which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal in ozone standards simply reinforced the EPO's willingness to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and agreed to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority we have. "
Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPO said that at some point Pruitt will use his "power of delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered on Pruit ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade to offer oneself to polluters and their particular interests. ”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius's church
750 years of St. Hilary ’ s Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery of the area of Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village jewel".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Trudeau sold "the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Trudeau and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church on the Tumlinger Berg there was also a stately court, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the noble center of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval canon law.
A lord who built a church, furnished it and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This involved the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger of the two were shattered on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be left later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hit and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower-tower still existing today remained as witness of the 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn cultivate the Hilarius plant.
As organizer, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilary Chapel on Sunday, July 16.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
To finish the serenade there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers present the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade ’ s organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It is illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen only a wind turbine had existed at the city border of Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone prevents the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent "paralysis" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days before by a change of the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved this zone due to a defect in form.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim gegen sich".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is therefore excluded from planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen County since last week," a speaker said.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to reconsider the matter.
However, they are unlikely to lead to a halt to the procedure.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four 200 metre high wind turbines on an area at Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11,400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach and Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine Lahn District).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The national road remained closed for hours.
After the accident, a 17 year old young woman from Bornich drove the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her 53 year old mother.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping possibilities in the city center in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city center for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" -weekend is to raise the awareness of the customers, which offers the own city apart from the usual supermarket and goods.
It is therefore planned to have a market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center are to invite to "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearby region.
According to Christian König, commercials are being prepared on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend.
Municipality and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This is a further step in the project "Attractive city centre".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest including a sales-buffet Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers to Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be reopened or reopened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Centers in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time in Germany ’ s third "home shopping" day.
Next to Bad Langensalza are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment with his or her buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more injured, some of them severe.
According to the fire brigade on Wednesday (local time) was still an infringer in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A first missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a disaster, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
Only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building during the holiday season.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia leaders were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You cannot tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the US southern border, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Trudeau were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "bad" and "stupid", and that the existence of trade, which was mediated by the Obama administration, would make him look like a "weird" after he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying “that ’ s the most unpleasant call for the whole day. ”
Moore ’ s Ford Major Massacre: Activists Restore Racist Lynchakt as Appeal for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rattled to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside the inmates hovered in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
Cries torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is only a reenactment.
But when a loop is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience threw out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It is really incomprehensible that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see her in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the tracking.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71 year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a civil rights activist for life.
For him, reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe ’ s community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A forensic physician places a bedbook on the corpse of one of the victims of Moore's Ford Lynchens on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI ’ s files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch ’ s actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ’ s decision enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy, and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses".
Brooks formulates it even more concise.
"It was an electoral right to massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and vote, then this will happen to you here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch's murders.
Their representation is vivid, poignant and is based on a kind of profound racism, many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It is difficult to watch and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about Lynchen, because we are then confronted with its ugliness in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've gone through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - crowded into a room and listened when Greene started a well recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes Co and director here.
He has played the role of the head of the clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who cries to Hester and afflicts him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- he'."
"But", one of the other black performers jokes.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And exactly there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of comradeship replaces the uneasiness.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the word "N", he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands above the corpses of the actors and executes Billie Holidays grieving praise "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the street.
They have experienced Georgian humidity for almost eight hours every time Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys tombs.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children crouch at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did that for one reason. "
Later the audience is composed with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatts about the reenactment with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that Lynchen is still going on," she added, "today is called only police shootout."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks holds his court at his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The reenactment is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like this, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat them. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful and frivolous production with a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with wall remnant and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plastic and elastic" logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it, an open Mercedes vintage car, in which the Rheintöchter pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" production.
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize like already in the "Rheingold" wonderfully.
They seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tug a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood and give the Krawallo's clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bows his hands to Merkel ’ s Raute, are celebrated with a storm.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - again in casual casual clothing in view of the great heat.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
In 2013, when he had to perform a gelling whistle concert, five years later, there was great cheering in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival boss Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this.
"One realizes that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where anywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt at the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at the school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years, a late volunteer.
How does this come about?
Quantity: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering study, let ’ s say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you are doing.
Do a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it is on the spot, in the focal point maybe, really.
And was it like that?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably at the youth office Herne do a social worker training and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.
Isn ’ t it something unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
One can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fears of contact?
Quantity: I am not the guy.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also times negative moments, but life is just like that.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business
The British educational group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The reduction, announced by Director-General John Fallon mainly for the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in a third cost reduction program in May a £300 million cost reduction plan (US $394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1 percent to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Counter attack of Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, a NATO statement was announced.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the Qarabagh district incident.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement states that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for NATO ’ s troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide of a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly militant attack in the country, since the US-led troops suppressed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US Federal President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US military and police forces supporting the country.
Correspondents say that in recent weeks, the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog rule after actions
The US Environmental Agency has annulled a decision to delay the regulation of Obama ’ s administration, requiring states to curb smog emissions, one day after 15 countries sued the agency for the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called "2015 ozone rules" and said it indicated the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," said EPO's head Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to determine where cutbacks need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has sought to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal council wants common area
In the end, the decision was clear: In two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future retirement home.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area belonging to the congregation is in the possession of the congregation, there is now no more obstacle to planning for the project to be initiated by a private investor.
There is a debate on this in relation to a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would like to see such a common room not only as a meeting point for the inhabitants of seniory-oriented housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitted café" made the round.
The decision, which was already decided last autumn by means of the allocation of funds for the current budget, is sweetened by means of funding.
The construction is in the renovation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a Community area would be eligible for funding by 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a resolution provides to signal to the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a stick between their legs, the finding that both saddle - which is based on ambient construction - and pulpit roof - which reduces the height of the truss and makes the construction more economical would be possible.
Not only Wilfried Sohmer believes that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps, it happens unanimously.
The common area is not that easy.
Daniela Ruf points to the many of her own buildings, with which you can ’ t really move forward, but now you lean out of the window in the common room, she says, “I ’ m hard to do with it. ”
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give any subsidy, but receives a real equivalent value, which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.
Strengthening the request to split the proposal accordingly finds three supporters.
Two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on road
During the crossing of the road a 82 year old cyclist in Garath on Wednesday was captured by a car and seriously injured.
As the police announced, the 82 year old Langenfelder had been on his bicycle on the black way road coming from Hilden at 12.20 o'clock.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove to the street, he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic on the opposite side.
He collided with a car that was driven by a 66 year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a retinue car.
FC Bayern München has to give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without it: David Alaba must let the game run against Dortmund.
The FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season with personal care.
Seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personnel care at the German football league Bayern Munich will be bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (8.30 pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
In a duel with BVB, coach Carlo must also give up David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the miners Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome and Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team has made responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said the speaker, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
That was not good at last. "
But the 58 year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
"We want to play intelligently," he said, expecting a "difficult, intense game."
The duel of the two German football league heavy weights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the resin
In the resin the first "Starpath" is to be created nationwide.
The Sankt Andreasberg Observatory is planning this.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-achievable installations in five to six locations" in the upper resin.
Inquiry would come St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the starpath train is to be extended by train.
"On the starpath, the viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star glows stronger than another, although it lies much further away.
It is also reported in which constellation there is a selected star and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda are visible to the naked eye.
Since 2003, there has been something similar in the university city at the initiative of the Society for the Promotion Planetarium Göttingen as the planned Starwerg - the Planetary Way.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the inner part of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end point degraded to the dwarf planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN ’ s Los Angeles offices until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization ’ s Super Boxing Featherweight Champion.
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former Four Division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound for Pound ’ s list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defended his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko ’ s manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect magnitude ”.
"I am a former featherweight," recalled Garcia.
“I ’ ve risen for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I ’ m not that big.
I am small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
The fans demand that.
Let us give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay per view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year, in order to agree next summer with Garcia a date (37 0, 30 knockouts) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares ’ Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay and view mode because all fans asked him," Garcia said and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he might take part in his Saturday ’ s match.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-match champion from Riverside would look "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the Ko...".
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top league fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Four injured after tire bursting
In case of an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the connection point market wide probably after a tyre breaker.
The car hurled to the right into the slope, where it crossed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed towards the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2: 2 start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points brings.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result as well, would not have been the two opposite at the 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is to be further optimized.
And a goal after a penalty match doesn ’ t want to catch any more.
"For the future, it will be the case that nobody will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three-chain than with the four-chain even after the experience in the preparation.
"I still do not know how we will operate in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build up well in the triple chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the setup."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance could be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"However, if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season."
His coach did not want to know anything about this.
"I only judge the start to the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a bad weather.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorites in the bones.
“But they don ’ t know so 100% where they stand at the moment, ” says Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a lighter favourite on Sunday into the encounter in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away, just because we have the claim to get under the first six, is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that has to be proposed from the outset," explains Fortunas head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Aged Evaluation Tests Published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80% of people tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are persistent in recent months.
“We don ’ t see any big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant, ” he said to The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "proposing that the person examined be 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI are taken of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans, to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can ’ t say it for sure, we shouldn ’ t pretend we could, ” he said to the Metro newspaper.
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case these are about 10 percent. "
Full in Plan
The work on the three bridges of road 108 between Lauterbach and ∑ is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going to be great," says Reinhold Leicht, Construction Manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Freiburg Regional Council.
In April, the work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of reconstruction in the vicinity of Osnabrück and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, which comes from Pittsburgh, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vault arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into years.
To ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge-cap.
This is a edge fastening, which is also used as an operation path.
A 2.20 metre bridge-cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing is that these are prefabricated parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridgecaps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach has required a special feeling of sensitivity.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
Local residents were informed about the project by leaflets prior to the work.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction Pittsburgh, the traffic is regulated one-lane by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed for construction work on the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700,000.
It is financed by the country.
Gerolstein: Bunter Protest bei deutschem Kartoffelsalat
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany, it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which peacefully shows flag on this day, because the mayor of Gerolstein invites Rondell to the poster "big campaign opener".
And well-known names bring to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on the spot hours before the start of the event do not want to listen, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally, the city's picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the convention in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the One World Forum and one of the leading organizers, really rejoices: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including an "urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat, which could also be eaten without problems", says the woman, who brought him with him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the offensive actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the German Volcano Eifel reported that he had made an effort for such an event and had been awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces are available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
In view of the event on Rondellvorplatz he says: "This is the good right of the people, main thing, it remains peaceful".
That ’ s what it does: Around 20 o ’ clock on Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle a number of speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate president Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for Alice Weidel, the candidate for the Bundestag election, and Beatrix von Storch, the deputy chairman of the Federal Parliament.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour the event takes, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 o'clock clean up.
The police can move away - no special occurrences.
trombone meets trumpet
Listening again with the Wolfgang trombonist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or just "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German training with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach resounds with the two in a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz hero Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating work of art.
This core of the programme was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try it all out, "Kristen Stewart says openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'."
The best-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately divided bitterly.
In spite of all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I've done.
Or do you think I had played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. "
Particularly under it she suffered loudly "Bang Showbiz" but in the school time, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the children told me I would look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself: 'Girl, be proud of you!'. "
Especially to the public she doesn't like to explain her love life: "People expect you to be in a certain way and that annoys me.
And perhaps some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public. "
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, democrats have moved away from me, ” Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said: "The change of party of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to get back into sport.
Russia ’ s Head of Athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country ’ s exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to combat doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were caught away from gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF's President Coe to reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized within itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships in Athletics, which will start in London on Friday, in accordance with the strict IAAF criteria.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF ’ s task force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden coaches are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Funeral act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who died during a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unresolved cause of the crash.
But she called the two faded pilots "experts of their profession".
"We bow down to this highest victim they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33 year-old Major and 47 year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse died a week ago on Wednesday in Mali, West Africa.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and transported on Thursday to the Cathedral of St. Peter in Fritzlar, accompanied by a service of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the members of the church took leave.
Afterwards the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Guests of mourning laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and experienced use.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained tigers pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also explained: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then nobody would have been able".
No doubt about the UN's mission to Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance 'for a country from which we are separated only by two states', she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken from the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr gave no information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband ’ s decision, as she said in the message.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ’ s accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
In 2016 he retired and took the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not have the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after his death, Lene Balleby, the chief advocate of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Born in Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, the sympathies of the people always flew, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand with the Danes in his nearly 50 year regency.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia ’ s tobacco and which had the reputation here to be the brand of socio-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
These were two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s day after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday we were in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) had plunged into a severe crisis the surprising withdrawal of a Green Euro MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony.
Five months before the official date of the election, the red green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Euro MP Elke Twesten founded her step by not nominating for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his faction to accept them.
This means that the CDU and FDP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red green government now has to decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it indispensable that the parliament should decide its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its way forward.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament withdraws confidence from the prime minister and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined properly, "said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed calmly if they are properly examined."
Thümler called Twestens step "something strange".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She called herself a follower of Black Green.
The Greens called on the apostate MEPs to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country mandate, which she received on the green country list, with immediate effect," said the country chairmen Meta Janssen and Stefan Körner.
The Group leader of the Greens / European Free Alliance Anja Piel said: "We very much regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Greens of Lower Saxony to the CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters, but also betrayal to Red Green," wrote the Federal Social-Democrats chief on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the parliament re-elected quickly.
The withdrawal of Twestens costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician put "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the well-being of the country", criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it".
Lower Saxony's CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputies to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the results of the 2013 elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament.
Interview with Agriculture Minister - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de the federal states discontinue the latest information about the affected eggs.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know at the moment, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of the concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005 mg / kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not transportable.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time the plants are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production plants are not directly responsible.
Instead, they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency.
Is there only a lack of personnel or of coherent competence?
It was the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences can be committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated means have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in keeping food supply animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and completely.
The impact of football ’ s financial rules on Neymar ’ s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to Paris ’ s French Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint Germain from UEFA, because the senior organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair and Play Rules, which were launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and the Brazilian will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team ’ s financing by Qatar ’ s power-rich ruling family.
Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but have to counteract them with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their business related to football.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA ’ s president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And, though Platini fell in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid a flat rate for the Buy out clause, it may distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
He has signed a five-year contract so that the total amount of redemption can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG with the most severe sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the Mannschafts league members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standards of market rates, UEFA would not make this a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG ’ s payments to Qatar could come from payments made by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that the World Cup will become ambassador and that such a maneuver could be easy to find out for the UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to respect any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They talked to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover after the signing will increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s withdrawal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership to PSG.
Arsenal ’ s manager Berlusconi, whose club is owned by an American sport ’ s tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi-supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey Bord has produced chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is on the verge of a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the speaker said.
Approximately 17 million small red-white packaged Schoggitafeln to 14 grams distribute per year the flight attendants before the landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume in accordance with "Northwest Switzerland" to be CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around CHF 1 billion.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a Schoggihersteller it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new tender.
But only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss entered into a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Lindt ’ s Schoggi Business Class passengers and Chocolat Frey ’ s Economy Class Schoggi.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short-haul route, both in business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and was only able to watch the discus contest from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90's' years of the 'Grunge' era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the sketch comedy 'The State' for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By getting stiffened to the core of the day - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they still managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the watering can principle, including a reef on the Stalkers' films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there ’ s another crazy and malicious plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved in, now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's under-lip beard of "Singles", whose former Big's Man's Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
These are the moments of accidental madness that might fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the gang how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east wing against the West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism.
The leading roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon and Levitt.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda -drama - a murderer wearing Reagan's mask is included - that it often plays like a single.
There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop Satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a Gelage.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own recent history and with their own.
Blow on Drugs - Mafia in the Country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest and Baar District, as reported by the Konstanz Public Prosecutor ’ s Office on Friday.
15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of more than 300 policemen were deployed.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the Konstanz Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Criminal Investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia were targeted.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the gang ’ s account.
way complains large gaps in the foreigner registry
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigner registry in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for the Management of Refugees, Frank Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to data, the register covers ten million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality had not been good in part so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
"Erroneous data inputs can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
Furthermore, the statistics on expatriates include EU citizens who do not have to leave.
Such incorrect allocations, however, led to 'a distorted debate on how to deal with those who are required to leave', the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they arrived from there.
This is the result of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrück Newspaper".
The paper states that the BAMF has carried out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, EU State Refugees are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
As a justification, the Office is now writing: "In the meantime, reception capacity for families with underage children has increased substantially in Italy".
Italy has given guarantees to accommodate and accommodate families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees there under the Dublin agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the political spokesperson for the Left Party in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are in danger of receiving conditions contrary to human rights due to deficiencies in the Italian asylum system and of endangering the welfare of children".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First and foremost Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality in the meeting of the municipal council appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, in addition unselfishly", underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the regional department of the German Red Cross (DRC), because the preserves are decomposed into their components.
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time Maisenbacher reported about the actions, which are carried out in spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second-best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's district councillor.
Obviously the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already before, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave 500 millilitres of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "lazy" when it retains interest rates on family income in the midst of intensifying pressure.
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate increases would become necessary over the next few years to curb Brexit ’ s inflation, saying that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make £15 billion more available under this system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real household income continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly greater" extent than markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank ’ s downward revised growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the 1.9% and 1.7% projected in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases, as tightening up will become even worse first before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot 'prevent' the drop in income, but she added that wages will 'recover significantly' at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate for part of lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU ’ s unanimity vote that caused the fall of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates, the call for interest rates had risen, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that it was expected to do so and would regain it in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are loudly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV vaccine prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, will now be delivered by the health service through a first three-year study estimated for 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England ’ s CEO Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention, ” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a“ decisive moment. ”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before being introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale that is specifically used, absorbed and implemented.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted to needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one who has a risk to HIV to be left behind.
Now that PrEP has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon SSV, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant government implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to bringing us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designers have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi ’ s architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering art went in there," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF.
"It is counter-important, so when you push up the door it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the land size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in conflict with one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton's Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday following several failed conciliations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first denim shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "high school in my last years when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.
Colin has held back very much, even though he was a former vice president and after a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
He contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to pass our surname through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hope for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president ’ s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information on President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the head on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the White House ’ s new Chief of Staff, met senior officials on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that comes into the President ’ s hands.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If Trump ’ s candidate was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from posts that were convincing, ” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign leaders, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise. ”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “under control ” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others – that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his colleagues already managed to keep him away from him a few times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump ’ s material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy staff leader Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that in the past he expressed and revoked false accusations.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh. ”
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and White House Secretary General, Rob Porter, “tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives. ”
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped.
This summer, the police throughout Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the serious criminals are not known by nature, references from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action that follows the EU Most Wanted Advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, as Europol said.
21 postcards have been compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times this was viewed.
36 of the online applicants have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of references after the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to 'Millionaire's Round'
Some of the most prosperous homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers on foot of war who have negotiated a moat drawn by the municipality to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire's Row".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters, after being thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have harassed the Solihull Council, which said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent away by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must indeed be forced into implementation by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I ’ m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can ’ t even stop it. ”
A local resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area. "
A spokesperson for the Solihull Council said, "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihulls Police. We take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we are presenting our case. "
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and revenue from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
At that time the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council.
But above all Freudenstadt ’ s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke already at that time of serious prospective customers at the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the Three Star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, there have been construction containers in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "nicely close to the citizens", as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and meeting room are included.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, stresses Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broadly arranged, explains Scherer further.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The conceptions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
When asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly.
Just under one million euros, he expects.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia ’ s Affair: US Special Investigator Launches Grand Jury
According to a report, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury in the Russian affair of US President Donald Trump.
The body has taken up the work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there have already been initial summons from the body to a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of intervening in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men acting as Republican advisors in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally brought Trump to the center and investigated whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand Juries are therefore also called Chambers of Indictment.
Most of the time they are turned on when there are major and controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board may also be enabled by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people to the hearing under oath.
According to CNN, talks have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who participated in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump ’ s advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former campaign leader Paul Manafort, were in conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US Federal Television that the appointment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
It does not necessarily mean, however, that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray Russia ’ s offensive as a campaign of its political opponents.
“The history of Russia is a total invention, ” Trump said.
The issue gives democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.
But they usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that 'fair' the work of the Special Investigator.
Former FBI head of the league James Netanyahu said three times that it would not be determined against the president.
There is no reason to assume that there has been any change in this, the explanation goes on.
Mueller, however, had only been deployed after Trump fired.
Because of this reproach, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to hinder the judiciary.
He said in June to a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser, Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
The White House collected material against the special mediator and his staff according to the representation of US media.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent congress special investigator, such as Richard Nixon, who later resigned in the Watergate affair, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the President ’ s insistence.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has dissolved from the scarcely seven times the size of Berlin.
This was announced on Wednesday by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research.
The colossus, weighing over one trillion tonnes and covering 5800 square kilometres, is now pushing north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
He does not pose a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region, according to the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was so far a part of the Larsen C-Shelf.
Shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows ever further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
Larsen is located south of South America, almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this shelf the balance of growth and cancellation was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelf was disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen C-Shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can decay if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shelves and iceberg does not increase the sea level, because they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after melting.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen C-Shelf is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University.
"This is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," he confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C-Shelf will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg back to climate change, in recent decades very many ice-shelves of the Antarctic peninsula have fallen apart.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants home rate at staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU calls for exit from the employers ’ association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break the district day has passed through 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 apprentices have their first working day.
The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously highly sought after.
Approximately 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 unfilled posts in the Mettmann district.
Among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should orientate itself inwardly and externally, show concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel ’ s problems, which one previously did not know.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, a large number of employees leave the service due to illness or age.
So it is high time to act, so that no more vacancies remain unfilled.
But Klaus Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes with his party still beyond the common application.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the Kreistag, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cap and amazed the other parties.
Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed that make it possible to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should aspire to a domestic tariff," says Völker.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service tariffs actually envisaged.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented to career years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, district administrator Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone to NGO ’ s migrants ’ rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that if they do not comply with new rules for their operations, they should not continue to use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Satet' because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in a statement on the social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take on board inflatable migrants delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to depart so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian coastguard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta, and Pro -Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not entail "significant changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner is the MSF.
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.
Ascents and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burgfest and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were again and again longer climbs, for the long Trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the viewpoint was next to the viewpoint, connected by "flowege" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many meters of altitude were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and resting huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed a curative brine in the open-air inhalation centre.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for E-Sport
Will sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting over the stadium grass in the wind and weather?
Fact is: E-Sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high stakes.
This was also recognised by the first federal league associations, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later by FC Schalke 04 and most recently by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for VfB", says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there are still many clubs on this train".
Next weekend, FIFA World Cup organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30 year olds, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52 year old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
Contracted with prominent e-athletes, one could be present online much more often in these markets than to send the Bundesliga membership to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In the sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the football FIFA simulation are fought at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, eSport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E -Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out with online matches, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware (BIU) predicts a rapid growth for the e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were thus implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
The turnover is expected to be 130 million in three years.
That is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", write the Deloitte advisers.
Many countries are already on the international stage.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood Actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, Dutt says that the first league football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to transfigure the old times, is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football stays as it was always."
Poison eggs ade - Egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal of poisonous eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and taken all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
In the shelves only eggs are to be taken that have not been proven to contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that push Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years suspended on probation.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who died on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes pointing down when she was convicted.
"Their actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“She finished his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no repentance".
But Carter ’ s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pains that we will bear with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy ’ s sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother ’ s wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"To no longer have this only person with whom I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention from Roy ’ s death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British fellow resident in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Bavarian Mini Club
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup.
The FC Bayern dares to win a big season - Extra motivation does not harm there.
Something was different on his seat in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich immediately saw it, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp and no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the tie he was assigned to his arm.
“The coach didn ’ t announce it, ” said the Confed premier cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as Bavarian captain.
Well, the record could have run better than the 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But Kimmich was able to interpret the sign of the coach.
It was not the eight year old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the leader of the game by young players, debutants and professionals who had just come on holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of confidence.
So anyone who has been chosen to take the inheritance of the player can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: Take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flicked over the field as a mini player.
Right behind, that is now its position, the white bandage on the arm did its rest.
And at all Kimmich seemed like the one who can take the oar in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unrecorded troupe.
He had a look for the whole while many others were occupied with themselves.
Vidal with his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches with it, to get out on the devil to tie up to the performances of the Asia-trip (worked also only to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it, in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey not to fall negative.
After all, that worked quite well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli Storm often did itself hard, additionally Süle tried to succeed a few times also in the construction of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was' not as we hoped '.
But he too showed a good performance at the debut.
Shifting the game, changing the tempo: "I was also brought for this style".
As usual this Bavarian world is still for the new entries, one saw in the following the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give in the catacombs one or two, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "I have already noticed what's going on here.
With Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB Women
Austria ’ s best-known football player just before the match was announced via Twitter and wished the ÖFB Women all the best.
The Bavarian Legionary is almost a club mate of ÖFB and captain Schnaderbeck and feeds with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Soccer Champion of the Year and Champion League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and enterprises from the region speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry hopes to establish a planning procedure, and construction law is due to be in place by 2021.
The West bypass of Trier also plays a role in the country ’ s plans, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan.
The goal is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Minister Spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) of Trier aims, as suggested by Wissing, at the wine a Rhineland-Palatinate label, in order to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports, which have been sinking for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new champion the Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 Euros is foreseen for the passed master ’ s exam and 2500 Euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master ’ s training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is fast to create facts, but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the Landesbetrieb Mobility, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The CCI calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the receipt of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept from the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Furthermore, disillusioning is the current broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies only rated network supply in an IHK survey with a grade of 3.4.
They complained about interfering Internet connections and cancellations.
On the other hand, Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of inconsistencies it already cleared the field again.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The President of the BMW Group said that the company was of the opinion that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", thereby banning or restricting diesel vehicles to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as calling back.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of chastising the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called cut-off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but driving back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted, while others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi ’ s engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an enquiry focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the visitors to the Isar to participate, a raft will travel through Munich tomorrow, which has a special message.
Who pulls it to the Isar again on Saturday, will see a big raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar and tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the visitors of the Isar.
With the motto "True love is"... the understanding of the Isar should be sharpened as a protected wild river.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists, the tuberculosis of his figures are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist, he worked among other things as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still sitting at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T and shirts, plush animals and clocks find its drolligen figures still much spread world-wide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D-film, which is to come on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he rather focuses on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-reminiscent conditions and insects transmitting diseases, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year.
Festhöhepunkt is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Merchants, guilds, merchants, vagants or a land-slave camp are to be experienced on these days in the city center.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on Sinaloa ’ s recent chaos through organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed to reach perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government ’ s pay list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the corpses accumulate all over the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and Inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the façade of the Riodoce -building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a Special Attorney General ’ s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists rarely bring the murderers to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit for discussion of security, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But there is practically nothing but silence on the issue of Valdez.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields, with rival factions struggling to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornamented, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs and trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he merged with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug's problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she was awarded the prestigious "Mary's Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento.
"You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and how to stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week ’ s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an expenditure expenditure that focused on the governor ’ s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor ’ s office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI Governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the abduction.
"We would have known earlier what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to the prosecutor ’ s office the next morning for a demonstration of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say that it is its DNA testing.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries there to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Since then, she has asked the government to redivide her because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco's Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who covered organized crime.
Last year, the media guardian group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas and Cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico ’ s city three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightening him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, Riodoce ’ s editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer when all of them began to buzz.
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the edge of the kerb they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the Riodoce staff followed his footsteps.
"How can you remember to close," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to dodge their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of a Canadian miner ’ s incredible rhino have been so well received that experts have described it as “the mona Lisa of dinosaurs. ”
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivores, although covered with armor and resembling a changing tank, was likely threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershade, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exposing it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its base.
Although the countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the counter shade - think of deer, zebras, or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator's behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been chalk predators," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of its life, including its preserved gut content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time Alberta was as warm as Southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don ’ t need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it. If you just squared a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it ’ s sleeping. ”
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20 cubic inches of long tips that protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded them into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater decoration preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is' rare as a prize in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot lies at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In a thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometer-long traffic jams and gaffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart and Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carambola on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (Aichach district), almost 30 vehicles were crashing together during a storm, including trucks.
At first there was no information about the exact number of injured persons.
It is about mild to moderate injuries, said one.
A large array of rescue vehicles was on the road.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of travel Munich, a ten-kilometre-long backbone was formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive disabilities on the reverse lane - through numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the registration plates of the car owners, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort check in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: you sit on the train and sleep with no clues.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the conductor and awakens an ungentle or tears the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the interruption times are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the non-creative ticket control system.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
Currently a test operation runs on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some prerequisites have to be fulfilled: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to buy it via the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book your ticket anyway.
And last one needs a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check" works like this: You get into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation appears to test customers.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to place Y he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can sleep, continue to work, remain silent.
The "check in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by the passengers.
"Who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, simply check in in the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets, but in any case one of the fellow travellers.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document that must be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of your own ticket and in the end takes the time for the conductor to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb ’ s apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a mail from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still on the street," it said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly retweetet on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield's Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Fergussy's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live penalty feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not customary," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and cried. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th.
It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black state" countless times before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to get free to liberate ourselves.
Even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women.
I feel I would do her a bad job of keeping her away from it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson ’ s possible non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new type of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri, she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado and Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because that's how I will be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah's leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
Furthermore, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black and Lives Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, although she was on the front line, because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the intelligence cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory, since three years ago she went into the streets in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From "Dream" to "Megalomania": TV Readers Discuss about Bit and Gallery
The Bit and Gallery moves the people, although they are not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone divides the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold hardly leaves the subject one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some of them say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), the other side says: "Does not need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The Gallery-Makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda ´ s square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer's market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women again and again very gladly.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is also that.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
This should probably not be very low in the new project. "
Eva KTrudeau: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There is already enough of this in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
Since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more specialty shops and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit of the gallery actually comes.
Or does the Gespenst Bit and Gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "That won't work.
And no one needs a shopping and shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall there is no place in Bitburg thanks to the insanely many - as I think - senseless building projects.
When the farmer market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York you can see many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey and Hagborg from Wangen and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public classified diplomatic messages about WikiLeak's website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey and Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his office.
By means of the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, Dewey's Hagborg has created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has been openly talking about female identification since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the Spy Law, computer fraud and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white Selfie, in which Manning obviously sits uncomfortably on a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 ’ s Stranger Visions project.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people could look.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey and Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "Suppressed Images", which predicted a future in which President Chelseas's verdict would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would, in fact, only a few days after the book was published, demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump waged a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender Forces to find new ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to resolve.
When Dewey Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her surname is with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which were sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall her mitochondrial DNA is sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist) Dewey and Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey and Hagborg, whose video of Spurious Memories 2007 is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the comic Novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free telephone in hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong.
"When they make your speech cold, they won," it says.
"So never hold your mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, then she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, by her own genomic simulacruses, which converge like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement behind its liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is being sought as suspects after a man was beaten with fatal injuries in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell and Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell and Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornel Duranleau was declared dead at the site of the incident, and detectives investigate the tricks as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an E-Mail statement that Lathem had now been allowed to leave and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an E-mail statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza Building, who had just received an enigmatic tip stating that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the world to be implemented Anti doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the Organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
As regards the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist. "
Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally ", Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization ’ s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be redeployed.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was shared by the corporate groups.
The communication said that this was a mere precautionary measure and that no further health impairment could be assumed.
As of now, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively for fipronillace-containing anti-decay agents.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The start of the Ups, which will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with her employees at your e and Commerce start, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco and Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee ’ s engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint to Hotlines, and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass the CSuite executives and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where ’ s the Fitbit for your company? ” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City ’ s Start Glint Glint, whose software and analytics are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a company ’ s heat card that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consents – so you can drill back why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the top of the workplace ’ s culture so that they don ’ t become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global Governance, Regulation, and Compliance could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Launch -up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year in the midst of Uber -case in miscredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the warmth of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS Hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Managing Director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumers ’ boycott, workers ’ fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the Convercent company is using, problems that were previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view of employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group at Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and staff engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If Analytics ’ third-party tools promise to increase engagement and employee deployment, it ’ s no wonder you ’ ll find support.
The data on the employee ’ s engagement according to the experts of the workplace is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take any measures.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Kotter International business management company, which has seen companies that have too much reliance on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask themselves," Did you really hear me?
Do you care about it?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly staff surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, adding a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better bonding of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day penalty practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It is time for a lot of UCLA and football players to talk on one side of the team ’ s new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricoto-parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled for the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 am the next morning.
“That ’ s a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days, ” said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday was Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two round day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore the first three training sessions of UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.
They are scheduled to do 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA rule change even if they added another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just squeezed it through, they continued to squash, they are great people.
I think as soon as we come by Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper class, which has already been thrown down with footballs, which cleared a protective net behind a gate post.
Bruins' players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it is not too far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not very concerned about this.
We have a plan. "
Facebook intends to step up factual review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact-verifiers from third parties and then display their results under the original post, said the world ’ s largest online-social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake-news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to factual verifiers who may display results of the factual examination from the original item.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake's News, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings, as before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing what stories are being challenged by factual verifiers of third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook ’ s headline news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze of music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in 1970 and 1980.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England 'covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell smoke, for then a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were there.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting a little"), all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries digging.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape workers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write".
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only got full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it into the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards representing who possessed what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Guys, let everything go its course! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good beginning.
Perhaps the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, repeatedly make debts and spend money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell's men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise heirs. "
After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been restored by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like: "Oh, now I have to deal with the damned life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau of Thursday).
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or? ", the creators of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle since yesterday.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"We have to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and campaign a medium five-digit amount.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and promotions in the officers ’ corps.
So also this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting took place no longer in the General Staff building, as in the past, but in the Prime Minister ’ s seat.
The discussions, chaired by the Heads of Government, now also included the five Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in abundance.
The government is attracting reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wire-puller of the coup attempt.
There have been negotiations in Ankara this week against 486 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempt to overthrow as a "gift of God", since he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article titled "Uneasy in the Military Headquarters".
In the general staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifested among other things in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the majority of the army and the security forces continue to do so.
In mid-July Erdogan fired another 7395 officials, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real lords of the country.
Three times they brushed up their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military back step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union ’ s reform plans.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an officer named by name who sought asylum after the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Anyway, there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army ’ s operational readiness.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on visas oriented to families.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are issued green cards."
The law will prevent migration chains and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for race shuttle
Over and over again in the past few months the future of the race climb shuttle had been disputed - now it should be quite fast.
Before the end of the year, the marauding line on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the race race shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is due to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau Rennsteig track, the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism," said State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million.
The country takes 75 percent of this sum.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators already agreed on the technical details.
"The roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This is intended to be the regular order for the race trail and shuttle on December 2017.
The Rennsteig is a popular train connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had been conducted to test whether the route was being used by a sufficient number of people in order to re-order it regularly in the future.
The route is also very dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn ’ t get even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes up.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are currently a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and the type of finger nail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them even more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his convictions, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford's wife look progressive.
Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot allows, for example, its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be "in mood"!
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine characteristics, the allusions to rape, if you take a step towards Frigid (that is, resisting) Farrah, disturb one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a roxxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while FRR notes its rising popularity, they remain provisionally on the verge of consumer culture.
But what leaks through the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women ’ s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who bragged about having sexually attacked women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Maid ') is not the graphical images, the intertwined bodies and the outcast eyes, but the realistic effect of this vision.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (though with pornstar ’ s proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: maid
Trump ’ s Great Performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split small families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, newspapers in the US gave advice on how to deal with Trump ’ s hostilities.
We all purportedly strive to let our filter bubbles burst.
Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been less noticed.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the distortive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization ” and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his bibs will one day no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes ” right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness when compared to his standards.
Nowadays, I find myself afflicted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s primitive version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which, compared to Trump, in fact, are a very mild crime.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don ’ t need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climactic music conveys this in a strange way.
Disappoint so many clichés of a city: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I ’ m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage – the theme of Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn ’ t count – but a large roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park is still a strange magical experience, however, as two two-year-olds, an 11 year-old and two women in the 40's can go there and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store I was forced to evaluate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetically grinning, while I was tired of getting my five-star credit card to her.
Oscar is transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
He left the prison for a visit to the hospital for the second time.
Last year, he was hospitalized for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a fall in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
He was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine ’ s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
He claimed that he considered his girlfriend a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year imprisonment of the Prosecutor, who they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecution Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition could be heard this year.
He runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal pupils will go to the grammar school, four to the secondary school.
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into freedom.
The lively crowd led a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it breed from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken, and the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain, and vanished.
After that the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank ’ s studies.
The hens danced around the bet with the young Gockeln, who wore cylinders.
The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grade that he felt accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in school bottlenecks, and the parents ’ representatives.
The Kükenzeit is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she is reluctant to release her students, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the fourth grade.
To conclude, all students heard a song of summer time and holiday time.
At the same time, great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first grades have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegal campers were arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for that purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euros 4 or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives an assessment:
Is the new action compulsory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schummelsoftware," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Office of Motor Vehicles (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet set an exact date.
Daimler has announced that he will write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their scope.
How long are the conversions likely to last?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"We have seen that car manufacturers have not yet voluntarily acted on the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign manufacturers would probably follow suit.
Is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there are so far no losses in value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump ’ s first award promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony with his wife.
For this reason, the winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, already announced that he would not attend the gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to deprive them of the means - and that burdens me".
The 59 year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, retires next year.
The position is already advertised - suitable applicants are however rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he conveys in the press talk.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application fulfils the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an introduction.
As Haslach acts as a Lower Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding qualifications.
Because this function the city wants to keep in any case.
If they could no longer fill it up, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated, to which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is safe about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future varied projects are on the agenda: The redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
Design is available for a city builder large scope.
With Haslach's own farm and nursery, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing city master builder.
In any case, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He is the builder, "in the end everything runs over my table".
He can count on many years of employees in support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (civil engineering) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been with him for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies himself with the job and wants to stay".
Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to information provided by the city of Haslach, be able to complete a degree in engineering or bachelor ’ s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building planning and planning law.
The City Building Office is subject to construction and civil engineering, construction management planning, land purchase matters, administration of urban properties, municipal depot with building yard and city gardening as well as lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Südbahnstrecke blocked
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators threw the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators leave two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich", said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and would also have put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the costs for rail replacement transport, the perpetrators could also be penalised by the railways.
Overall, a "substantial" sum is to be expected, the speaker said.
The damage was rectified on Friday afternoon, the train traffic on the southern railway line could be carried without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning, two of them concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, this can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestines and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells ".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also works in humans.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes ’ s postdoctoral student Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but did not have another group of the same tribe that was housed separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach of the intestines.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these types of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan and metabolism known as the indol of lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice ’ s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes stated that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect the intestines in our stomach.
It is not known whether Tryptophan ’ s by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Moreover believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
With Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genius", Jose believes, after the Wednesday evening opener had his debut against Sampdoria.
The £40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season round of the season, before the UEFA ’ s Euro Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder ’ s role when people like Paul and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the blues preparatory tour of Asia and managed only 45 minutes, which admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League ’ s start.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football," he said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu also started at Aviva Stadium when he formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that he wished three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have made a great effort."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state of Michigan and withdrew in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New hit for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Just no fire from the party headquarters, only no headwind from the federation - that was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from Willy Brandt ’ s House have been watching the events in the provincial capitals governed by the SPD with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwind.
It was deep shoals.
And one by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal government of the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green simply cannot govern reliably", said CDU's Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising group exit of a Green Euro MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Party ’ s Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Greens of Lower Saxony to return their mandate to Elke Twesten.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "said the Federal Managing Director and Campaign Manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true," sighed a SPD leader when the new Hiobsbotschaft reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing without a government majority after the transition of the green deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD.
And no one knows what will come next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at Saarland ’ s election in March.
A blue eye, no longer, calmed down the comrades at that time.
After the state elections in Schleswig and North Rhine Westphalia everything will be different.
It then became - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into turmoil, the Düsseldorf bankruptcy smoothly killed the party.
The comrades worked hard to get up again in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just drawn new courage, came the G-20 summit of Hamburg.
And with him came the next depression.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he then did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been critical.
Miese survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil tried in the past weeks ever more strongly to set accents in the covenant.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz.
They let him grant, because they promised themselves of Because a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because of the party internal conflict of the Lower Saxon Greens basically does not blame.
And not Schulz at all.
For the time being the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the Land List of the Greens of Lower Saxony, the Lower Saxony MEP continues.
The logical consequence would be to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the SPD of Lower Saxony as the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputies falsifies the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further promises of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local nuclei III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a retrospective of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden Württemberg took over two thirds of the subsidy sum.
In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations to date are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4, the Karlsruhe Regional Council received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.
The subsidy amount is 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 Euro would come from the country, the rest from the municipality receiving.
How is a refurbishment area created?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role whether there is any interest whatsoever in the planned area to renovate.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also be postponed again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Republic of the Countries programme "Social City", in the context of which the refurbishments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented on an object basis, i.e. per property.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be established as a statute.
The grant period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for completion.
In November or December, the statute decision should be taken as far as possible, so that the renovations can start next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing the urban imbalances and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A refurbishment note will then be entered for the respective property in the land register.
Pietzschmann himself would come back to receiving and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent postalically to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Arch", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet", information on the size, division and inhabitants of a living space can be provided.
The blue "factory sheet" is only to be filled in if the building operates business premises.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler stressed that the distribution of the subsidies works according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
One could not "reserve" any subsidies for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown, in order to make the attendees a renovation "tasty".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to information provided by the military to the TIME magazine.
Sikorsky VH 3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Trudeau and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the HMX commander on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at around 7 in the morning for the event at 3 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the safety personnel of the unit remained with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
The records made available to TIME did not show clearly whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was doing taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX and HMX occupations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn in order to deport the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX1 held 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in training requirements of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for "Non-President-in-Office" support missions.
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly tariffs of the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, however, the DoD ’ s refund rate for the VH is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of running the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Defining the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refunds is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the DoD refund rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise this. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a fire engine.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky, and talked to the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss ahead of tricky task
The leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga is Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the table steps Suchsdorfer SV.
In spite of five matches, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has still retained the sense of reality.
Team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions I find the team very good. "
For class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV above all imports from the far north provide.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Championship.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this is becoming difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck. "
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north is practical.
Maxime Janvier could give his debut for Blue and White.
If the Frenchman who is still active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it into the Bundesliga match, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first place this season.
The so far unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik was Castillo yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP championship in Kitzbühel am Ball.
He should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill the squad.
How America Can Damage OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump did not seem happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to enact the law," the Congress had wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the US offensive.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV have been concerned since then, which, together with other European companies, co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
Nevertheless, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the group could defend itself and which could really hurt it.
Narco ’ s Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of attention in Netflix ’ s hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer, Netflix ’ s series is far from over.
The seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali and Cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 companies" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl and David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the day care center lunch again itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city daycare centres.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal daycare facilities (kitas) again on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the department for youth assistance, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 daycare centres in Krefeld area, and 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch time.
Last year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are looked after for 45 hours per week eat lunch at the kindergarten," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in the 35 hour period of care, if children stay until 14 o'clock."
46 part-time staff will be at the service of the kitchen from 1 September: they will heat up the food supplied, add salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, giving out the food, clearing, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"Employees are firmly assigned to a kindergarten," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the range of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the daycare team", Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the vital management to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because it is also about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaningful.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the daycare center, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the daycare center - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm, which it had turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-regulation and external distribution for the city, it says from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are reset.
"But with around 750 people in the education area, these hours are not so important," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN's mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in the provinces in the Council elections. Three women stand for the role of vice-president and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election trial that coincide with the transition from international hostilities to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully hand over power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will further enhance Afghanistan ’ s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13 year old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13 year old girl on Thursday.
According to information provided by the police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends at Kolpingstraße, around 14.55 o'clock, because they wanted to phone the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl ’ s mobile phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey the duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB ’ s concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure itself with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at Tollcross ’ s site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to learn" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company ’ s branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie called for “concerns to be expressed that financing for the modernisation of production lines would not be advanced. ”
GMB ’ s senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can ’ t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affecting our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and wealth, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living, and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie. "
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint Germain will not be diminished in its persecution after offering an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul and Paul returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, PSG will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way in which He forced his way outside, although a source near the Catalan Executive Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG ’ s president against this prospect?
When Manchester City showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of PSG ’ s best players.
“I ’ m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we ’ ll stand in opposition to them, we ’ ll contact their players, ” Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, it will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG's Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave in any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prizes for Vice President.
Roller discarded and damaged
During the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown culprit deliberately overturned a scooter on Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus set up on the cover of the vehicle damage of over 200 euros.
Police deputies, phone + 49 (0) 7422 / 27 01, ask for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car met him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and touches the guardrail.
On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg was driving Loccum with his VW around 19.55 o'clock on the B 215 coming from Stolzenau towards Leese.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came to meet him on his lane, so that he had to move to the right.
The tour driver touched the guardrail.
The car caused damage.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his ride without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes-driver had not even noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter expert to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under phone 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen's report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Cathedral patron's report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the scandal of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German press agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger, the 93 year old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their misjudgement of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the coverage of violence in the cathedrals was measured with "double standards".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts", which must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to the church and this is a delicious meal."
She also pointed out that in her youth "blows were a normal pedagogical means", "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one".
They would find it unfair to apply current standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports about the cases of abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the commemorative volume "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger, is completely wrong (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440 pages of the report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 cathedrals.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Particularly with high emotionality the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated R. ’ s general humanity and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even linked positive memories with him ".
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal with the Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows Georg Ratzinger relieves in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 pages of the report on the "Incidents of Violence of Protectors at the Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows" gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger, the master of the cathedral chapel.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a cathedral treasure brought no top performance musically.
How do you consider this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-assurance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of activity.
One can at best accuse him of learning about it too late or not having taken the first hints seriously enough.
The cathedral school, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also has an excellent record, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rage.
That he not only banged with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also distributed slaps in the ear and pulled all too cheeky boys at the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To save his honour, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both with parents and teachers.
Do you still know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I too have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
These are, of course, trivial compared to what this report really is about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at preschool.
One wonders, then, whether it has to do rather with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
Many people who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or assurance regarding sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one of them, representing the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in educating about sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.
How do the cathedrals assess Ratzinger ’ s role with regard to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questionable student formulated it like this: "Concerning sexual abuse... I see no case... in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it... also really absurd to assume that it is him... Jacks have opened up more hastily or clearly or rather than towards their parents, heads of boarding schools, teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be freed from any assurance.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the notice.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "violence" at the Regensburg Cathedral.
The former cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem, that everything was mixed up and mingled into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is clean separation: between the preschool and the grammar school of the cathedrals, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedrals.
The whole terrible pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terrible suffering, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the cathedral school.
On that, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and even "paradisiacal" conditions for many.
What was different at the cathedral school?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence".
So at most the reproach remains to have looked away.
But despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported about the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and didn ’ t want to hear anything about the processes at a school where he just didn ’ t work and was responsible, (according to the witness), and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral school, which the report even reproduces.
He points out to them that "the caning penalty will continue to be practised in preschool".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning sentences were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that they happened in a legal grey zone, as we all know.
For him, too, it was difficult to estimate where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit had really been crossed.
One cannot say, however, that he always looked away.
That is simply not true.
Only in 1980 was the caning penalty officially abolished at schools also in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to those days.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "pitfalls of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, nor to what happened to innocent children ’ s souls in the preschool of adversity and violence, which already goes far beyond what was usual at that time.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. slap in the ear and pulling hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also speak?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, where the cathedrals played only a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But that too must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world-class status out of the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg Cathedral patches, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, unruly boys do not make big singers and stand before every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, graceful, deeply believing and heart-good person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something about a fly.
I regularly get in touch with him, as many former cathedrals still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him until today that he once was strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedrals are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to whom they still look up today and whom they almost worship.
And please, once again quite clearly: all that is reproached to him are educational methods that were then commonplace.
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a scapegoat in the media.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency, a 93 year-old man, who has acquired great merits and would probably not know the Regensburg cathedral sparrows without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany, would finally leave in peace.
