Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be given, among other things, for the outstanding effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the committee that elected him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Then, the presidential couple are scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, though the third to do so in office.
The White House has already announced that upon receiving the award, he will speak about the war in Afghanistan.
The President does not want to avoid that subject, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war effort was further increased by the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check for ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
He's proposing to donate the paraffins to charity, but he hasn't decided yet which organization specifically.
During the entire program, the President and his wife will attend a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the prime minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the award.
He mentioned, for example, feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Society of defenders of the nature Litoměřice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction permit procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The President of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like garbage separation containers very much
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in villages in southern Moravia, you can find containers for separating garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There they need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not sorted at all.
It seems to me that, for being the second largest city in the Republic, the city councils are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in waste separation, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for this waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the middle of the right container?
It's almost impossible, it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in Moravské náměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
I don't want Mr Onderka and his colleagues to be angry with me, but that seems too little.
Needless to say, it is not easy to sort garbage elsewhere either.
That's why a lot of my friends prefer not to separate her.
For the purpose of vacation
What's happening is the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Luckily, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already overflowing the container.
It's still the centre of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
The fact is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the socialists in Brno.
They prefer to buy the city the extra league of hockey, which is a disgrace to us all in the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad that I can compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM company, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
Paroubek's budget took money from the rent and sickness allowances
After the left, despite the government's opinion, adds funds for farmers or civil servants, there may not be enough money in the budget for rent, sickness benefits or building savings.
But neither for the interests of the national debt nor for international litigation.
This will hurt all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they relied on the government to ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or sickness subsidies.
The thing is, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay back the money.
The state doesn't have much of a way to get money.
If you don't reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, you have to raise taxes.
Everyone the left has added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, his children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sickness benefits, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year the treasury will not only lack 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity subsidies, as the government did in its deficit package.
Because of the dislocation of money to the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion short of the construction of highways and railways.
These are mainly those sectors where the tendering process has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, where the projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delaying or stopping the thirty major construction projects; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution to the decrease in funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is majority-owned by the State, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never certain nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year the ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to clear ecological damage, to supplement the income account or to provide a reserve for the planned income reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion was obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including in the construction savings.
It is not clear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, to draw on the reserve of the government budget.
The project Státní pokladna (State Box) is also missing 100 million, which is worth 2 billion and has already been started, and should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With the press of a button, they go from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the objective of the American company VMware, which concentrates mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
You can have two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, run at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will be available to customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It is not only ski-keepers in Krkonoše who are concerned about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays at hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas will be snow or mud", said the maintainer of the Spindl.Info news portal Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations should not hesitate to book a stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel operators in Špindlerův Mlýn offer weekly stays mainly for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll keep offering them, but soon they'll give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the vacant rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute holiday accommodation", said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is hampered by the lack of snow on Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if it'll snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks remain snowed during the week, the Christmas dates will also be exhausted", says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to book rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last available seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well", said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the New Year's Eve rooms are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at about 60 per cent of capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of Omnia hotel.
However, for now it seems that the hotel owners of Krkonoše will pass the snow craving waiting.
Thursday's temperatures should drop, and if there's rain, it should snow in the mountains.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest man in the world, as a diligent student, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, whom he himself considered the most foolish.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it turned out to be a copy of the script Bush used for Iraq, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "just like in Iraq" used several times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward".
It was he himself who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from civil war, and criticized it as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, proved that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only one possible and successful, so that today Iraq is not mentioned in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but he left his successor in a much more favourable starting position than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
Field captains again urged him to increase the military contingent, most notably the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He called for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general into thinking about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he had at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this process in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will produce the same results as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders abiding by agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is being kept.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the head every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of the confused relationships, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "action-capable", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is clashing with his volunteerism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and now it is on the verge of exploding.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war so that they "come home soon" will do some miracle here.
From the political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor which can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: whether to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
The answers will need to be sought precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if this one turns out to be a total failure.
The directors of Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road ahead, said former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having set aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became a sensitive political issue with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax bank bonuses above 25,000 pounds (about 712 000 CZK) at a one-time rate of fifty percent.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except physics
A record number of five women received this year's Nobel Prizes in specialised categories and literature from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for their explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was given to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman winner, was Physics.
This prize was awarded today to the scientists Charles Kao for their research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes and telescopes.
Each prize winner picked up his diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to SEK 10 million (approximately SEK 25 million).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is shared amongst them.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation.
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his permanence in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also the continuance of Janota in the cabinet, are supposed to be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
He said the deficit was too large, which further deepened the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the spokesman for the president, Radim Ochvat.
On his continuance in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which Klaus is preparing to sign, the Czech Republic should be running a deficit of 163,000 million crowns.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved the left's proposals for the transfer of funds and increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the Social Democrats' proposals, which covertly increase the budget deficit.
A serious internal political conflict broke out between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, and the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, began to be controversial.
Critics say that the budget, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public borrowing.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; he declared today during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been neglecting "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
He says they don't have a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a wider consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government, is appalling, exceeding 200,000 billion crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The popular were happy too.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When you play him, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, played the leader of the abolitionist movement, who ended up a slave, the fictional president of the United States, and even God in Evan Almighty, but he rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and, for many people, as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation is still racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and so he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong to the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story into theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that when I shake your hand, I get your energy, it's transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller".
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invencible received positive reviews and there is also talk of Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film".
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 percent positive rating.
The secret of Norway's splendor solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry finally admitted yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, once intended to be the pride of the Russian military, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even their repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In the Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from a moving vessel that is submerged at the same time.
So it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians were equally at first not hesitant that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that we cannot simply talk about failure.
The first two stages of the missile held and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately at the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defence management only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism for the generals and that is why they continue to affirm that "Bulavá" will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov will once again compete at the age of 51 in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in the KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to sort out some formal matters, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice, he will become the longest-tenured professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, won the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second half of his career he had successes in the NHL as well: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has complied with the union's demands.
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime work.
The unions declared a strike on Monday because of the frequent overtime.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on another Saturday shift for this year.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, which is essential, and that is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday 19 December, that is to say, it will be done in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who work the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can claim the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, which means extending the holiday by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive travel and food allowance.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped the manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two hours more in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation persisted practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they pledged to meet the requirements and the document was signed, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent overtime work.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged harassment.
Management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency by strike of Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
The unions demand that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The series production started last November.
Until last September it produced about 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works even on 'calcified' HIV viruses
Czech and German team of scientists test new compounds that can moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective on a common variant of the virus as some drugs already available.
AIDS is not curable until now.
However, a combination of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body can significantly prolong the lives of patients.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of overcoming the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallic carbonates are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that's different from all the drugs used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, "improved" compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the albumin of the virus.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no HIV fractionation would occur and no mature, infectious virus corpuscles would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still being systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
Testing of the effect of this series of substances against HIV proteases was carried out in test tubes, and also against their resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications make metallocarbons interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say it leaves time for analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the House of Representatives, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, but with the left's amendments, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, which covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should be running a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and the feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Mr Nečas is convinced that if Mr Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He indicated, he's thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is their disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do the nominees by the ČSSD, who imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear, if he resigns, if the House passes other bills that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness benefits, pensions, or the amendment to the service act.
Topolánek: The ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the SDO have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the fight against the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, he will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I haven't thought about it, when the time comes, I'll deal with it, said the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer left for a meeting of the European Council in Brussels this afternoon.
ODS gave in at Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask the ODS deputies to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he said when asked if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned, he knew that in the months to come it would be mainly about bolshevising the Chamber of Deputies and destroying everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
The new ČD train schedule will see fewer trains running at almost the same rates
The Czech Railways will cancel or restrict some less used high-speed and local trains from 13 December and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two per cent compared to today, after the new train timetable comes into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More opportunities for connections to the capital will benefit, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, where a commuter road will be added.
The direct train, on the other hand, will no longer run to Bratislava.
On the Prague-Písek-České Budějovice line, fewer high-speed trains will run, and direct Prague-Letohrad connections will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tábor-České Budějovice route will also be cancelled and some high-speed trains on the Prague-Písek-České Budějovice line will be reduced to only some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava by Pendolino.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses. The Drahi will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year. The local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the high-speed and local dráhy trains they have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one year.
The Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why they did not raise the prices of a vast majority of the tickets.
The changes will only be made to the day-tickets - ČD Net and the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipino men continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
The armed forces have today in the southern Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several students from an elementary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP news agency, which previously reported only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction took place in the province of South Agusan.
They say about 19 gunmen are using the hostages as a live shield in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the handover of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police had previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which was caused by the settlement of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the killing, they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also operating.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, Invictus by Clint Eastwood (official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), will be released in American cinemas, capturing a part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere, they are born of the reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela is the President of the United Nations.
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The Commission has also made a number of proposals for the establishment of a European Union for the protection of the environment, and has also made a number of proposals for the establishment of a European Union for the protection of the environment, and has also made a number of proposals for the establishment of a European Union for the protection of the environment.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the lead roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well for it.
I met many times in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns the whole world, he added.
In the national rugby team's uniform
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field.
For entering the grid in the suit, which in South Africa is considered almost sacred, Mandela won great applause, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants, fourteen years ago.
The football championship may succeed in helping people to unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans are however skeptical, as stated for example in a recent interview for LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns in Lounsko
The fire has caught up in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the firefighters of the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Earlier the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however later they changed their minds and the fire is being extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The damage is estimated at several million crowns, to enumerate exactly it will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
Mandatová says it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, and the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, spokeswoman for ČEZ in the north of the Czech Republic, the electricity supply was not cut off, and the fire at the substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps půby operated in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switchboxes with 67 transformers, which carry electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the 4339-kilometer-long electrical conduction.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander against three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura will present a complaint for calumny to three social democratic hetmans today.
These are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the Hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radiožurnál. He was a member of the group.
The demand relates to the company's effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the cake", yet we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned having the evidence from all the regions.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint to be a continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and himself.
Naturally, I am prepared to defend my good name and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I think that this time too it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jančura is manipulating the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and using false and false arguments, said Mr Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures by the regions.
He told Radiožurnál, that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be against corruption as such.
Jančura initiated the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tender.
According to Jančura, similar steps are in contradiction with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD deputy because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we didn't stop, we could lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a deputy of ČSSD, I know what kind of man he is, I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine, it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are complete.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also clear on the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born after 2 August last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not to have received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth month of age.
Last year a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Generally, experts estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually on vaccines.
They will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent on all the vaccination of children about 500 thousand annually.
The covert vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
From the pneumococal infections in our country every year die according to the research in the hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the covering pneumococcal vaccine in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, there are also suggestions that this vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
From January, it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
Mandatory vaccination would be better, noted Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahlas civic association, for example.
Your association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, which our association participated in, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have achieved at least this.
I think this is the path we have to take now, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococci.
At the moment we don't think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, it would be possible to reason about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs so much, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that by next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment later, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MEPs were, however, afraid that insurance companies might "take the money out of health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they're paid for by the insurance companies.
It's estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "a museum robbery"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been charged with trying to steal paintings worth US$20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
They claim Frazetta and another man used a bulldozer to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unnamed police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a depot".
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such a permit.
Labour defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show his seriousness about deficit cuts, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5 % increase in Social Security expenditure and a 1 % ceiling on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Anger at Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems".
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of the pre-budget report
Social security with an additional increase of 0,5% from April 2011
Economy to contract more than expected 4.75 percent this year
New 50% tax on bank bonds
The 1 point corporate tax increase for small firms was ruled out
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the Treasury's estimates, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and one who earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 a year will earn £110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60 percent of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the top 5 percent of salaries.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. They will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again towards the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75 per cent this year, much worse than the 3.5 per cent decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be £3 billion above previous estimates.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party's "debt crisis", said the projection of a loan request for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" dodging difficult options until after the elections due in June 2010.
"They have not included anything meaningful about what they will do", said Shadow Minister for Finance Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and they have squandered it".
All important announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, from Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which would seek further deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised from the tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sandcastles".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as the inflation of some disability allowances next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of electoral manoeuvring, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is being provided to the people most in need and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget" is a good one.
Although ministers did not release post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment in public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the figures from the Finance Minister implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defense.
"This is really postponing the pain for later", said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the big announcements will come after the election, whoever wins", added Roger Bootle, an economic consultant for Deloitte accountants.
"This was the false report before the budget.
FBI investigates "detention of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a house raid in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether these are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information on the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and what kind of circumstances are holding them", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing", the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported; but she said the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terror infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported them missing in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses" of the peace process
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have been equally deficient, according to a report by the advocacy group Amnesty International.
The report details "the patterns of abuse" by the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
The thousands arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession" is the word.
Amnesty International quoted the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election result.
"I'm often punched in the face", he said.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who claimed to have been held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and government response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski run was made in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol landmark into a race track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the hill in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping ramp, in front of a 100-meter-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the runway, but it was quite frightening.
Below is a beautiful view of the twinkling city lights.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent", he added.
Prizes were awarded to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on minarets and there is widespread alarm about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and thoroughly argued study of an issue that divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the five to six million Muslims of France with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students on the questions that most interest them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Arab scholar and scholar.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't get to spread this argument completely.
The conservatives are only skeptical about the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism might be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives a 'value adjustment'.
After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most desolate scene
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, transport and fisheries interests have been focused on newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In On Thin Ice, writer and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who proved their worth in the face of the polar bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the tip of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught swimming along the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, it featured 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult's range. The weather is almost never right: A polar bear resident in Singapore was turned green by the algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the United States, and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians in snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a startling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave first clues about the displacement of ice masses.
Then Cold War submarines mapped the shifting ice cords that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped out in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the system flowing into the Arctic ice, formed by jets of salt water that are compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders inside, they're all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... this could be us .
Marines among 6,000 who lay crowns at Arlington's graves
PFC De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we're being shipped, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is now an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
By the second year, the Walmart Foundation had donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career military man.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the cemetery's broad meadows and hills.
Volunteers headed to older World War I, World War II, and Vietnam war graves, because they don't get as many visitors as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red knot tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are buried, was virtually silenced.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the ongoing wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others bent over to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet clay, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes at the grave of their son.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after I die, I want someone to remember him".
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission to leave the country to accept awards on several occasions, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to break the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel guests, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug trafficking.
Berbena said he couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as handing out free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch organization, which recently published a tough report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, Cuba itself", a reference to Raúl Castro's placement as the country's leader, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel a vast network of terrorist recruiters, who scour the Internet for radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
So they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the case.
The official said the men did not mutate and were even trying to get proper clearance to access al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, American intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not letting in those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking particularly closely at aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to gain access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit to, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It's transformed into a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center take bolder action on climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "the Earth says 'enough is enough.'"
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travels to Peru, her mother's home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mostly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists in sports masks and black attire placed several explosives near the main canal of Copenhagen, which is near several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest didn't seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation".
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "Because the meeting place is so big, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
Last week's federal scoreboard on math performance was very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best-performing systems in the country, the scoreboard showed that fourth- and eighth-graders strode at a faster rate over the past two years than Atlanta, Chicago, and New York City.
But what is recorded in the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress figures is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of D.C. fourth graders over the past two years rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the yield gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dropping by a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the white people were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year period, the picture is no more encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was released, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has narrowed to only 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week that the breakthroughs celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping for joy over a two- or three-point gap, said D.C. Councilman Kwame R. Brown (D-Aggregate), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a staunch critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what worries me is that we're not devoting the time and energy we need to our middle schools.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and secondary school, who did not master the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum of math from kindergarten through sixth grade, emphasizing real-life games and experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for underperforming schools, which will be needed to reduce the gap.
Here's a sort of daunting dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
So the target can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other city supervisors, she tries to cling to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on making sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that every family, no matter where they live, can have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to closing the achievement gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year on a 185-day year, which she considers an "indicator" for seeking a larger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more future
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong rally.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had just graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less one of impressed guests than enthusiastic prospective students.
Yes! This is where I'll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
"Oh, seriously?" he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school's low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the kids had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already absorbed its deliberate message completely: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States to Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the university education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze the best performers say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time isn't going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's university tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college-preparatory programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies walked away having bid on only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for fields auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military retreats, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more aggressive risks in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest oil reserves, analysts said.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have forged ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation (NPOC) has bid for more contracts than any other company and has made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on the way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
The companies preselected to submit proposals made bids which were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
The chief planner of al Qaeda has been, apparently, killed in Pakistan.
An alleged U.S. missile strike on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified plane, the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official from Pakistan's civil intelligence agency said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al Qaeda military planner, who directed the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
It was engaged in worldwide conspiracy, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the delicate nature of US airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda's top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly risen through the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking operatives.
The pace of CIA-led drone attacks has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count from The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site claimed.
UN High Commissioner in Kabul about to resign
The UN's top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eid's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for the military withdrawal starting in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who would collaborate with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it is better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I first came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested by its former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said the accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the assistance efforts by US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money was being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the UN's cumbersome hiring regulations undermined his ability to attract talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks over its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that a "package of incentives and disincentives" would be needed "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer greatly" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the directives of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, it indicated that it would renegotiate the restriction of its nuclear program and would agree to give up a substantial part of its enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have backed away from the tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran's toughening up with the international community over some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they haven't been in terms of additional meaningful sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions".
In a statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless and baseless accusations" Thursday by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution".
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon you".
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave".
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy for just one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously stubborn, misbehaved one-children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy became effective, according to the Division of Child Development.
The number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Family Planning and Population Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labor shortages".
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden", he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the policy's enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions based on the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnaturally high male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both the husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they toned down many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Demographic Research, said that central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the signs that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and to slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unobtrusive.
Disappointing Answer
While officials in a rural town outside Shanghai maintain that they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, more urban districts indicate no change.
Huinan Municipality, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the city's births in 2010 are still projected to only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai's Caolu Municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, such an option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yeah, they're stealing our ability to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political one.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said that she wants an only child because she was an only child herself: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others".
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For middle-class parents with two careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare when the child is 9 months old".
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to cut emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by challenging stances and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The text, prepared by an ad hoc UN task force, does not discuss how much money rich countries would give to poor countries to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how the developed economies and the major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of global temperature rise that policy makers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It shows the profile for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries would cut their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also stepped up talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
US climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary cuts by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top US climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the US would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The battle is as much about saving individual economies as it is about saving the planet, with China and the United States clashing over their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world's 24 most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the boldest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are arguing over who should pay for the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government can reach a deal.
High-level officials, including Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, got off the planes and rushed to the Bella Center hallways, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The sheer disorder of the meeting - where 13,000 people come and go from the convention center each day, activists playing guitar present nightly shows mocking countries they say are selling out, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand instead of via mail - poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We're entering the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 140-mile-an-hour train redefines that Monday feeling
At 5.13am on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Pancras station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected secluded areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the switch from planes and cars to railways would reduce national carbon emissions as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, may still hold back Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, the Times has learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line from London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where environmental impact may be contentious.
In rural areas, the plan shall be drawn up within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, whereby a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Only one line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option", said a railway employee.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open until 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400-metre-long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the capital's space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts in the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if it gets the job done, the network would have to be built in sections.
Initially trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to secure a switch from planes to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers are facing mortgage for a £75,000 orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency house.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living on rations', increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications in due course and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members' expenditure.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as a "greenhouse for entertainment".
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry into his previous mortgage arrangements.
Last month the committee cleared him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan exchanged the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage from his London estate to the house in his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was soliciting approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their requests increased to over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the whole increase was going to finance the £75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate at which it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still asking for £1,250 a month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as House opposition leader in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "on rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like a b****".
He said, "I spend my money on my garden and I ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't".
The MP, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the pay office that this could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound sterling symbol on Mr Duncan's lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he had been asking for £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the payroll office and subsequently by Legg".
He added: It's not about dodging and delinquishing or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the bounds, by the rules, authorized and all.
It could not be any clearer or simpler".
Come, you who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the palpa of Brighton Beach.
Brighton's Palapas have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using Christmas trees as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests able to see the last palapa from 5.30 to 6.30 every day, with filled pastries and free served punch.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society".
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to an old, strange building?
The idea for the Palapa Advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we're trying to prove and represent that through spirituality".
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
About 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital to demand an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change must reach by Friday, which would come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing global climate mobilization represented by these demonstrations contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with pebbles and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to them, especially members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold".
The peaceful demonstration left the Parliament and headed for the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers, and a candlelight vigil was led by the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them in sky-blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we took to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt to the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there is time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that are drying up, waterways that you can walk on as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure in the anti-globalization movement, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which includes numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and handkerchiefs with sun-powered slogans.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters gathered to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, though Georgia denounces "fraud"
Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia that Moscow recognized more than a year ago, elected its president on Saturday, but Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to Abkhazia's Election Commission officials, turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing president Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the ballot measure.
This election is a sham.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation", his spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladzé said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is trying to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling booth at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central issue of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different locations in this small territory of 216,000 people.
In Gali, in the west of the country, district head Beslan Archba warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to monitor the development of the ballot.
In a brief ceremony, he said: "We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and very particularly, for the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, said Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticize the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes to Russia the control of Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current government or the opposition.
You need a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on high alert, arrested more than 700 people around a massive demonstration.
About 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the cold afternoon of the Danish capital, which until December 18 hosts delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
The peaceful demonstration left the Parliament and headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers, and a candlelight vigil was led by the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, knocking several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a pebble, and four cars were set on fire near a house occupied during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
Extremist groups are not taken off our radar, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them in sky-blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".

Oxfam, together with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilised several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which includes numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy demonstrated in front of the Philippine capital's City Hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters gathered to demand action on climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
History and geography are reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to be broadcast on the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "fortified" by the reform of the general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of the scientific bachelor.
From now on, all first-year students will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "enough with the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls the best students".
The branches of General Education and Literature cannot be sub-branches of C, he continues, stressing even: "I did not hear that historians or intellectuals were indignant that they had eliminated history and geography in the second year of the bachelor's degree in technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven out of ten (69%) French people disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in the secondary school. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives of the right also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from the secondary C programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which sacrifices, according to them, the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will be aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also be practicing in real conditions during the M2 year, after which they will spend a first year in front of the classroom as practicing teachers.
If you do all the practices proposed prior to the competition, you will have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in the national education system".
He also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal High School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain climate change
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Superior Normal School in Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the "Ernest" conference round, a 15-minute series of expert presentations filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called the day when students baptized the fish in the school pond.
We selected about 20 participants from among experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, who presented without notes but with the help of graphs in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public would understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record".
Videos filmed during these lectures will be online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: displeasure among prison guards, action planned
Prison guards' unions called for a "general mobilisation" on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers Force (2nd guards union) asked the off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their belongings.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", because it calls the non-compliance with the payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October "shameful and unacceptable".
And the first guards' union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization . . . to increase discontent and fury".
The Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions, guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I have asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures designed to ensure that this situation, which is caused by a miscalculation of the number of overtime hours, does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blame budgetary demands", Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding public holidays if those in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salary, the Bordeaux penitentiary CGT believes.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not what was expected, said the secretary-general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to famed TV host Oprah Winfrey that he came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I get".
During a special interview that ABC will air Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays at their new prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the program excerpts transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, I gave you nice gifts last year", she said, teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before replying humorously, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only many years later that I learned that he had given me that ball.
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I lined all the furniture up against the wall, instead of arranging it around the house, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was interviewed again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his associates, while RTL claims that the singer was put into an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was interviewed again on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors found "lesions derived from the operation" of herniated disc performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey calm by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be put into an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula was introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the International Clinic of the Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles for an infection stemming from Delajoux's surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured that "no problem" was made because the rocker is "a fighter".
"He called me just before he was going to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to do 12 hours of flying after such an operation, it's not possible", said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "reacts satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection is "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for "colon cancer", after a mild infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "66 Tour", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been hyped up, with fans and journalists noticing the musician's difficulty moving around the stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title at his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in long swimming, won an international title on Thursday in a distance he feels particularly affection for, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in fact many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in the 50m freestyle, a mark he holds in the long swim (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as is usual, a first at international level.
Bousquet overtook Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better, and in that case, I've already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits which will be banned from 1 January.
These swimmers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same event.
This time the swimsuit didn't help German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in the 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up to this race.
I knew I couldn't break a world record this time, but I did defend my title and accomplish my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a panel sarcophagus that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 centimeters high, dates from the third century C.E. and was estimated to be worth between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satirists and drunk women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still on, but so far, this lot has been the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico said it did not have the conditions to transfer to its territory the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe passage by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, declared the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him safe passage, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the deposed president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as the acting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat when it asked me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to present my resignation", Zelaya said Thursday on radio Globo, where he has been making statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refuge in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, declared Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to the Honduran radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, which was heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was ousted on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his reelection, which was rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must answer to the justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was elected, an election recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, and the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68,78 points to reach 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7,13 points to reach 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0,58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he explained, considering that the market was concentrated "in the glass half full".
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners said investors were focused on the US trade balance, "which reflects an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared with September, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, with 474,000 applications filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "was the lowest it's been in a year", points out Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market went down.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond to 4,492% against 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of the power abuchean to the "Ladies in White"
This Thursday hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of those detained, an AFP journalist said.
"Death to the Yankees!", "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" were the cries of the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the international day of human rights were detained by plainclothes police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The officers forcibly put the dissidents in the vehicles, which were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in such circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", laureates of the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" hired by their declared enemy, the United States.
Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An estranged man kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Sena Highlands) on Thursday at the time of the largest influx of people in the afternoon.
According to the initial elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant, who was stabbed with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, had beaten an elderly man at the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses said.
The man, born in 1929, died in hospital following severe injuries, according to an official with the Alliance police union.
Then at the pharmacy or in front of this, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, in his thirties, got in the way and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The other wounded man's life, with vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was admitted "in a state of shock", a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped along Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a man in his 30s, and another in his 40s seriously.
By night, the crime scene was still unclarified.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried crossed on his back, said a union official in the Alliance in the Altos del Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to the testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't succeed because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd rushed at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to stop the gunman and were punched, according to police testimonies.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a man wounded in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I felt a very serious wound in his abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person came, about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identification papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office referred the investigation to the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pre-trial detention, he hasn't said a word.
A police source doesn't rule out the possibility of putting him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to overpower him at Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "any such deranged one whose strength increases considerably under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurred more than 30 years ago, be dismissed.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", complained to three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeals of gross procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that at this very moment the charges be dismissed, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before he could pass sentence, which constitutes a serious breach of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September that he "had lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel requested a trial to allow him to present the evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejected the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a girl under 13.
He never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing".
With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of escape?, Asayama asked.
She says the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, even though he despises its authority".
One of the three judges, who now has 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel wasn't the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, to close the case.
He claims that his client can no longer stand being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad hut, awaiting an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses its way and is held back by the rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday with no direction, in a market that is debated between better indicators than those predicted in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to reach 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technology component, lost 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains tight, the volume of trade is getting smaller and smaller and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market sentiment on the strength of the economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab analysts.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive and larger than expected month.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were held back by a further advance of the dollar, which reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "drives down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market went down.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4,497% against 4,492% the day before.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are in the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Mexico's Perla Beltran, Sierra Leone's Mariatu Kargbo, Gibraltar's Kaiane Aldorino and Canada's Yanbing Ma were named Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during their time in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and lived countless experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
The event, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, North Johannesburg, on Saturday from 5 p.m.
I can't imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates concentrate on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas, will host the event.
South Africa proved capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
As last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (South West) for the 2010 World Cup in June, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've dealt with people I never thought I'd meet.
She'll probably be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with excitement.
News about Johnny Hallyday "very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he descended from the plane that was bringing him from Paris shortly after 13 local time (21 GMT).
The son of the singer, distant, assured that he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection derived from the operation of hernia disc on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put into a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection, a sequel to a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated on again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries from the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, where his daughter Jade attends, to witness a school performance, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Head of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of the Parque Monceau, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus declared.
There's talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, since I had two operations for a herniated disc, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he said that the singer had apparently "gone without cannula, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic circles.
He operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also intervened on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the court on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, an attorney for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who is sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said that the procedure "was performed without any problems" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not require drainage", he added.
Anyway, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been multiplying since the summer, came to a halt.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances and their derivatives is a step in the right direction.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the sigla of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, so as not to be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As support for its management, it received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy, urging them to renounce the acronym and to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to them, under penalty of a court action.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you would propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which demands that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the UDF name from all media, as well as from (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette 'to transfer the ownership of the mark to the rightful owners'.
If not, they will appeal to the courts to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
He is taking scandalous and fraudulent advantage of the lack of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on his own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of power
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to expropriate her of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of show stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of power, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a trial worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fighting for the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt be examined by three medical professionals.
The heir and major shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, as he left the hearing.
The Court of First Instance held that the Commission had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 85 of the Treaty.
It is excellent news (...) The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or artworks.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the provenance of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations turned out, on occasion, to be a great family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she stated that she was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since their wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again".
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office, for its part, considered once again that the applicant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge had refused to grant her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully competent to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No one else will be able to appear in his place", said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the public prosecutor's representative.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule once the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers had been given.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was a matter of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the centre of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to strategies for market conquest... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to the factors of customer preference is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all intellectual functions of the enterprise, especially R & D and, even more so, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved (...) to have proactive behaviour and a forward-looking view"; it requires a commitment from employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a management revolution, which would be to put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls are of relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the Orange questionnaire among its employees, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not at all.
- In principle, because I could verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that American "neuroscience" recently revived, and which the Institutes of Study and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the smooth running of modern enterprises requires adopting a finalist view of human behaviour.
It is about integrating into all business management thinking and practice a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of making their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring the mobilising factors, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their 'social performance' and relocate human resource management 'into place'.
In this way, they create a favourable terrain for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from the right for "just war"
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against America's enemies, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the awarding of the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party, to the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the subject of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is certainly the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted himself on Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich declared during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free nor could they give a peace prize if the recourse to force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current columnist for the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world", as he "always does", he "spoke like a North American president" by reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few on the right who are not so convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it's easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression", the Californian newspaper enthusiastically noted.
Obama "made the speech that was needed", the New York Times estimated, judging it "both bleak and uplifting".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organisation to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" over the agreement, following several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement by late in the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by knocking on the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours, which began at 11 a.m., was necessary to get everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was feared to disrupt the holidays", Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wages (in international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low-wage workers.
It's not much, but we started with a big disadvantage, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades at the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the lowest salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognised it as "a historic agreement".
The Commission is also proposing a new directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel expenses and for the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will allow, in particular, to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies affiliated to this organisation and, secondly, to the whole profession, should the Minister of Labour extend it.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced it as a "naïve business", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to upset those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, the Unostra lamented.
The OECD said the agreement "put at risk the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions disagreeing with RATP proposals
The conflicts in the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between unions and the RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, Saturday and Sunday trains will only run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at a rate of one train every two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers each day, was pleased that "RATP is striving to serve the department stores".
The RER crosses from west to east the city of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains ran during rush hour, and almost no trains at valley hours, as had been planned.
Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Île de France.
Thus, at dawn, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier to be on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned to supervise police and law enforcement.
The RERs operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, and the results of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon, which the unions say is "not satisfactory", will be analyzed.
The Director of the REN proposes to negotiate a specific protocol on all aspects of REN A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium owed want, says Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said indignantly, pointing out that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned for Monday to "examine more fully the conditions of the profession", the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "didn't care about weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers stormed a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, which had so far refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Indépendants have filed a notice.
The unions are asking for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line which has a million passengers daily.
The RER drivers, all in the second stage of their professional career, charge between EUR 2 200 and EUR 2 700 gross and between EUR 600 and 650 in premiums, for shiftwork, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could make it much more difficult for the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the court president, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are barred from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the termination of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament before becoming parliamentarians without party label.
The decision follows a 2007 proceeding by the Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of following the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government is reaching out to the Kurdish community with a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds can stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could generate a resurgence of tensions in Southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with police over the past weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement threw tear gas and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people also gathered.
Following the verdict, Türk said the court's decision would "deepen discouragement".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, which is made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of parties.
This is not a solution, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something that makes life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter at the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master all the vehicle technology.
Maybe this weekend the weather guys will announce it for the first time.
Over 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with the snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows heavily in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-tracks with large salt vehicles leave, explains Brauburger.
Main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around 3:00 in the morning.
Approximately 1,040 kilometres, as needed, should be covered in up to three hours with wet salt, which is more adhesive.
That's why the FES starts around 3am, "so the roads are clear until the rush hour traffic starts".
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem", says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then nobody is ready to clear space for salt-laden vehicles".
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is the turn of the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is for side streets and side streets.
That's where the trouble comes from, Brauburger tastes good.
Around five in the morning, the FES infantry is set off, clearing mainly the dangerous points and cruise lines.
The FES could not normally take over all the bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight of the bridges, Brauburger says.
Since these quickly become slippery, the salt vehicle is started as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call you.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-meter-long, 1.50-meter-high animal that ran on its two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this wouldn't have been anything special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It tells us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we've found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected the remains of five specimens in total.
A discovery confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says it is an exceptional find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments".
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current view, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important lineages: carnivorous theropods including Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long-necked" and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (saurians with bird pelvis), to which, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus belong.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt comments.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air sacs, like those possessed by the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to air sacs, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive air-bag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related lineage of later giant sauropods also possessed air sacs and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the earliest dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, researchers infer that the saurians first appeared there.
Thus, the three lineages were separated at first and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa hallae the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three waves of migration into North America occurred, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
Naturally, there are opponents too.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Your opinion may give a distorted picture, for in South America alone many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral lineage of reptiles to the dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains a mystery.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories don't always last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halted the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and had since led a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
The participants are professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen are participating.
The police eviction of the occupied Goethe University casino in Frankfurt had worldwide repercussions.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, last week had the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike evicted, because the walls and artwork were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolving of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The Management Board has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the lawsuit.
Most of the occupants have not caused property damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's future, says Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment is a step in the right direction.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday in the Wiesbaden provincial parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a CDU deputy in the provincial parliament.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying the students' arguments and demands thoroughly, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000, located 23 miles [37 km] from central Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives from Selenograd have been in contact with the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The European Union and the Member States have agreed to the agreement on the establishment of a European Union.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Vice-Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Selangrad's Mayor Anatoly Smirnov; the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Sciences Research Centre will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to enter the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were settled.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed high enough for anything.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, much more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate a decade of hopeless construction site chaos in the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at the time to be 19th-century engineering fossils, acting as brakes on modern rail traffic, since in the past it took a huge amount of time to hook up the locomotives from behind forward.
Roll, dry stop, continue the journey, but that's the way it's got to be.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway along the transEuropean lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan 'Heart of Europe'.
S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement reduction.
The railway terminals of course also have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with a tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE constructed section to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and local politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably from the designer's computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for passenger transport, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably greener than that carried out by trucks on roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains because of the steep gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometres of long rails across the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the track has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport ruling.
The Federal Government is waiting at the regional parliament in Wiesbaden to decide whether it will appeal the decision of the Hesse Administrative Court on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the legal ruling of the VGH, which is over 400 pages long, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had argued in writing on this date that in the case of the planned construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the Land would have to re-regulate the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to appeal this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to abandon the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of words.
It's quite difficult, if you let someone keep their word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the federal government was trying to get its night flights through misrepresentation of the law and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally sound decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents it, it would never have been the case with your group's claims about the nighttime air traffic ban.
The U.S. banks are paying back the loans.
The big American banks, shaken by the crisis, are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
Bank of America returned all the aid granted to it by the Tarp bank rescue fund for a total of EUR 45 billion (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And Citi Group also plans to return state subsidies, according to a report by CNBC in the United States.
The aim is to free the institutes from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with accepting money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had secured approximately 19 billion in liquidity through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough money, including for the sale of rubrics.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayers on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the absorption effort of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
Citi also intends to raise money on the capital market in order to be able to discharge its obligations to the State.
CNBC reported from sources familiar with the matter, that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday an increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, they had already returned their aid to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Rapid selection
In the end, it all went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the ZDF (German TV channel) management board pressured the head of news Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild was supposed to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially to avoid anticipating the proceedings.
But surely it also influenced the fact that it would not harm the ZDF director Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal was not approved by the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the time of writing.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him.
Because the majority of the Union on the board weeks before the election had indicated, they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief had been organised by the Hessian government president, Mr Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief on the grounds that under Brender's direction the ZDF's news reports would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flagellated.
In the end, 35 public law experts had even intervened in the debate, calling Koch's action unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romantic philology.
He later worked at the "Südwestfunk" radio station and the "Frankfurter Rundschau" newspaper.
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, originally the "heute-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the chief editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and host of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the dismissal of Brender, who was elected this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch's opponent on the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of pro-ZDF politicians from the control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the board of directors was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a party henchman.
In the party calculations Frey is still awarded to the left-wing liberals.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally gave in.
Students in the future should be able to outperform their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module of the course must end with a single examination.
The aim is also to examine the workload of students and to ensure a 'real and justifiable measure'.
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The Länder undertake to make more flexible joint structural rules for Bachelor and Master courses.
Federal regulations that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of universities have been continuously talking about improving the ability to successfully complete a career (studability).
Now for the first time a specific content was discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single exam", says a 30-page document intended to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
The aim of 'sensitive reduction of the test load' is to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the eligibility of students, explained the director of the Accreditation Board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, "studability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be examined thoroughly for unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of language.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative".
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be re-accredited every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to review all the courses.
The responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federal states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and the exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has provided additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities should implement tutoring and student counseling programmes, as well as strengthen examination offices and overseas.
The Federal State and the universities intend to allocate 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel university law.
She believes that a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a model career.
The career structure should be made more flexible, and evaluations at other universities should be recognised and the Master's degree made more accessible.
Until the end of next year, it is intended to examine all the courses as to their "study-ability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition discussed again the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism about the decisions.
In the federal board of directors of the Juso university groups (young socialists), he argued that the shaping of education policy should no longer be done "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students as the main stakeholders should now be able to have a say as well.
The president of the university board of directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
The Bonn agreements were not enough for the GeW: the GeW demands a legal right for every student with a Bachelor's degree to access a subsequent Master's degree.
The Federal States must also ensure that the current generation of Bachelor's students will have sufficient places for the Master's degree in the future, with the best possible study conditions, said a member of the GEW, Mr Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But on increased access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrolled", reads the first line of a poem by lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures on poetry in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave a lot of talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of their Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Attempts at recruitment had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the Securitate's attempts to provoke fear", Söllner concluded.
The lyricist is Werner Söllner.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary polemic with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that evidences the abysses and the wickedness of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
I had excused or defended him on all the hard points for him, Markel said.
"I feel a moral need to make this statement", he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for Securitate-Spitzel gewesen spies, Herta Müller wrote in the July issue of the weekly "Zeit", after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved must have speculated and in some cases known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the controlled procedure for reviewing Stasi files in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the Securitate files (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files has since been rather dragged.
Since 2005, there is a law regulating the administration of the files.
An interview after the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large.
"She has psychosis", in the end they only interrogated her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be shown without twists in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions inevitably arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there is silent blame.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the craving for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that a member of the foreign service elegantly dressed was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had handed out samples.
The bald man had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Besides, he could have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol involved, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but I would start work again tomorrow.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we have reached the last eight", namely in the Champions League, thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni of Romania, but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation".
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
So, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "classes reales" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing
The Champions League round of 16 (first legs on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return legs on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the thunderous entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had in a short time inspired the bewildered professionals of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to give and love for the game.
I went to the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more proactive, explained soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, he accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "When a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to injury quickly progressed to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon "perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation".
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was here.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports director Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all.
Like Gross, the players and the manager refrained from overestimating the victory against a defence weakened by a lack of reliefs and totally outclassed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still a long way off.
We haven't gotten over the problem yet.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating his 40th birthday, even after the first win at his home for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that are made by others, not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had blamed weakness in management on the board, which had decided to change coaches under pressure from teenage fans.
Also, the fact that his day off after the games had been removed was described by Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the defender.
They're probably not gonna be friends forever, the two forty-somethings.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the prior efforts of the team of the substitute coach, the spectacle of great playing and battle strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had an important part in the success", said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and the man in the plastic bag also agreed.
Fight of the heavyweight championship
Fiery duel in Bern: Time and again the challenger Kevin Johnson was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still the heavyweight champion of the world.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version of the association defeated the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision in the night from Friday to Saturday in Bern by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two times world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had hoped for could not be achieved.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Arena in Bern, Klitschko, at 2.02 meters tall, wanted to dictate the fight mostly with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters shorter, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the blows of the world champion over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively lead his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, to endure twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
"When he weighed the weight, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klitschko returned
Also in his fourth fight since his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained undefeated.
After a break of almost four years, he beat then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to hand over without a fight.
Later that year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his title defence, and in September he defeated Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to bring all four major titles into his family.
His brother Vladimir is a World Champion of the WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, who is 2.13 metres tall, in November.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the head of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin  Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of knowingly deceiving.
In the "Tagesschau" news broadcast on Saturday, broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens' group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In a case like this, it's usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was reported that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately to the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of intentional killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and her Green colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on the concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had correctly and completely informed Gutenberg about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it transpired from the surroundings of the two high-ranking officials that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert reportedly asked in a letter for clarification of the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far, he has not received a response, he said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday regarding the reproaches made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's investigation commission, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreaming worlds
In the waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill and the drug addicts who are losing the line between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unrestrainedly indulge in the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, one who experiences sleep-like states during waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world to be a lunatic or a drug addict, or at least a maniac.
But such images and voices do not just come from the mentally ill or the drug addicts.
It's our imagination that's to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the lines between dream, madness, and reality.
Dream-modified states of consciousness can appear in a variety of ways, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to as the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - has been upset and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur.
Gravity has no power over him anymore.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, sleep was even "a psychosis, with all its mispurposes, mad formations, and mirages".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of devils with wings, blood-red cheeks, deformed, grinding their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Strident, malignant voices resound from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and fixes them on a hook in the ceiling.
You climb up on a horn and you put the knot around your neck.
He jumps.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson for you! the voices shout in a chorus that breaks his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and get cured!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, he's also manic-depressive, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and they fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at the Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
It's generally not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is".
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are grounded in reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, why our brains are so wild is still an unknown.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can cause anyone to temporarily lose touch with reality.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that other factors besides genes are also involved.
Researchers believe that the victims suffered minimal brain damage.
We suspect that brain neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also goes unnoticed for many years, remains a mystery.
Environmental influences also play an important role. Stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a predisposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, since they interfere with the brain's transmission system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether a hallucination is pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, alongside psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injury.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also experience hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or are uncoerced; when our brains get hot, but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love sickness, or other exceptional brain states.
In the case of a study, the results of the tests are not available.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
Just a regular girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes during recess, a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her in amazement; no one, except for her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a weird dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the kid.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the other visions aren't real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher  to his eyes and ears  is introducing a new classmate, while to the rest he explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot tell whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the grimaces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs, appear before his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, shout at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents or friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Since she's been in contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or has a restricted stimulus, it is very likely that after a while he will begin to hallucinate.
I think the brain is unoccupied and takes care of itself to find entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a child and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at age 13, she learned that the man she had been calling "dad" since she had reason is not her biological father.
Since visual and auditory hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, people like Sarah K. have difficulty distinguishing between visions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real".
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special ability.
The borderline between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences tend to become pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative. Madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated what is called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person experiencing them considers real and that later on cannot distinguish from waking.
Dream states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened with a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self and imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an intolerable situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
It's all real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen from Zurich describes his dreamlike experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of saving the soul.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness embarked on several days of travel following a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in a world he created and visited strange places from other times: he found himself prostrate in bed, an elderly man on board a sanatorium in a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who made narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, he surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and ran into a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, that's how he describes his experience.
On the contrary, memories of the mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in the most irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense than even real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, daydreaming, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of the outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow may come

The sons will take over the publishing house at 27
The new publisher Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the hands of his two sons in the future, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg  Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precaution.
The next question is whether they will be actively involved in the company.
Also, if they're qualified for it.
You can't put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they're not trained enough to do it.
That would end the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would retire as chairman of the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen had been appointed as his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
I was in charge of technology at the beginning.
Later, he took over the treasury and with it the responsibility for the company's assets.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17, and their son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from decline either: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the desire to seek capital, who have judged wrongly and thought that they could rise as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur", says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with Time in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Full beauty
Everything you could ever want in terms of beauty and well-being, within your grasp.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is responsible for laser hair removal-; Spaxión, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while enjoying the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities Spaxión offers.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' who guide the customers' steps, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touchscreen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Its director says that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go to the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Varied Scots
Christmas is coming and it never hurts to go over the star looks to fit our party outfit.
The shape of the cleft, which is very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an over-the-top, very complicated breakup.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and gather the views and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to give a boost to the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous community of Catalonia.
These would include activities linked to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting electric vehicles.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and has a number of complementary projects in place, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main exporting sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automobile sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would have a situation of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants", the President of the Government said.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Automotive Integrated Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which mobilised an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The head of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and motoring enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is a 20,000 square metre exhibition area, which will be home to over 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars, but you will also find all kinds of items related to the motor world in ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors of the pavilion will include accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of classic motorcycles that will delight collectors and curious.
The participating companies include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, catering; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and catering; and Cochera Clásicos, a specialist in Mercedes Benz.
Tests of ability abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be held on a dedicated circuit outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sporting features
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with environmental protection.
For this reason, it has just incorporated the Mazda3 the system of stop and start of the engine - christened as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved throughout its set.
The finishes, the vehicle finish, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, we found that the front seats are excellent ergonomics and grip.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set made up of the instrument cluster and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one also presented by the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are in contrast to the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact features more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Add to this a large, regularly shaped trunk.
The automatic stop-start system is, at least for the moment, only available with the two-litre petrol engine and 150 hp and with the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a delight, distinguished by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and its low fuel consumption.
And although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort, and for its contained consumption.
As regards the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one incorporating a greater number of standard elements.
The most notable of the standard equipment is the lane changing assistant (RVM) which removes blind spot, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy tires.
In addition, if its equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc loader, among other elements.
The Commission
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly noted for the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres per year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, which is only associated with the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
The luxury premiere
L.A. is covering the red carpet of sensuality at the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were more dazzled than ever wrapped in sexy models at the premiere of Nine.
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as she is, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or navigating the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in America when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see it on the street, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is very low priced and has a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay for, say, the iPhone data plan.
The company has released two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been in place for some time.
Yes, some carriers have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience, you need a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated efforts to achieve affordable roaming charges for all Europe have had little noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin, there is a fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (which is curious to call Fon when it lacks Wi-Fi) gets these kinds of rates means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to pay for their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It's a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month-to-month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifetime purchase option like Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I check my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The color of Michelle's fetish.
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite shade of the American first lady.
If you attended Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States wearing a dress and a coat of this color, you chose the same to accompany him at, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the reception in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: besides being a similar color - yellow-green with bright reflections -, both times the outfit was composed of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat the vesture.
But the fabric from which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If the takeover was a fat lace, in Oslo it's a velvet stamped.
The accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And the hair is also different: one is picked up this time, the other one is loose.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to become mothers.
This is the finding of the study 'Fertility and the career of women in Spain', carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have had limited opportunities in the workplace because of motherhood.
The study shows that there are many differences in the start of cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
Women who have no activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start living together earlier, have their first child earlier, and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are delaying cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer children.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting a relationship, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time in their life to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a great influence on maternity, although less on the timing of mating", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women at marriage and at the time of the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they marry and have their first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with primary and secondary education have become mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively on average.
"Another division is also established between women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child", Delgado details.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, chanting the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The star of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris signings, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join the club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its top representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered for the annual awards ceremony, held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poker de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays of writers who have passed through their literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical likeness, life and work), but looking for something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vincent doesn't spare scares or illuminations.
Besides being an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to read and reread.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against the miserable fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him".
About Graham Greene: "Our man was carried away by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the thrill of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition".
About James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers are repeatedly thrown off".
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Sometimes he said he was the heir to a county landlord, sometimes he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented scream thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to carry its echo to the depths of the night of the 20th century in its literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms".
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these lines of Spenser: 'Sleep after effort, / after storm the harbor, / rest after war, / after life's fullness pleases death".
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also brought her depressions.
Her husband would normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has there been a case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent outstripped his madness".
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but get through to Baroja for Faulkner's guns?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame to serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed by her and our dog, a mixed-breed dog rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilograms and, without a word, they kicked him twice, leaving the dog badly injured.
We are outraged because we did not find the amusement in a gratuitous attack on a small, helpless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the heat that was caused by a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she believed these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic man who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five o'clock on a typical Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt will do much and to avoid raising any suspicions, just clarify that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find it amusing to mistreat a helpless animal for free which gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know what has happened to good manners and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safer products.
Sales of light commercials are up
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6% increase compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and the vendors Ganvam.
The good data, not the host, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound in the last month, the number of enrolments accumulated in these 11 months is 40% lower than in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, including all the vehicles in the light commercial vehicle fleet: passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
The clouds that most affect demand have not disappeared either, since although they are also purchased by private individuals, the majority of purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So the constraints imposed by the closed bank credit line must be supplemented by other factors, such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this context, and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
They are open to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to buy a light commercial vehicle of up to 3,5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been impressive.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they again reminded the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial ones (trucks and buses).
The sellers' association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now compulsory
As with ABS anti-lock braking and will be the case with ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already available on all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while a period of absence is fixed for the rest until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's measure aims to increase pedestrian protection, but because of its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by range.
The emergency brake assistant increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's push-pull.
But he doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not hit the brake before the collision and half of them had not used all their power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance the car takes to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were fitted with these types of components, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents involving human injury would be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event of failure to react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device applies maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on the 8th day probably - as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is for each of the points of the plan to have been agreed upon beforehand by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories to be delayed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but is gaining momentum with the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In the event that there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and costly, jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and made it slim down to no less than 80 kilograms, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual actuation, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with the lightweight tires of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system added another six kilograms and changing the door handles to fabric ones, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK transmission, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox unit, mainly on California side roads, on mountain sections with really twisted tracks.
His behavior can only be described as impeccable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the car does not tread the asphalt with vigor.
On the contrary, we had not tested a model so small and light for a long time that could deliver such safety in curves, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short walk for as long as necessary, until we tell him to sprint, to brake, to recover and to repress his engine...
What we ask you to do, thanks to your direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's roar, already premiered earlier in the Panamera.
The acceleration capability is brutal, whether from a standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed in the Boxster Spyder was fairly punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids hardly made an appearance throughout the journey; and that in some of the corners we found ice at dawn and gravel, already in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive you can on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price tag of 70,831 euros.
'Bag girl' is a good one.
Intimate to Karl Lagerfeld, an image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlette of the 'maison' parades, the singer lavishes her malota face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than Bad Girl or It Girl, she's a Bag Girl.
Baskonia is awarded a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant 82-91 victory in their visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite the numerous losses that Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and thus is positioned in the lead of their group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triplets scored was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
The Victorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triplets scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The game started in the face for the blue-grass, who were put from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already presaged that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main shooters of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavis team opted for Barac's inside play and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with pitches and applause on the return to whatever was their home, to further extend their advantage at halftime (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' of Splitter's rating already presaged that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the match, despite being on the way to the break, was not decided at all and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were instrumental in turning the yellows back on the bright (50-49).
More drawbacks
Ivanovic's injured but not much less dead needed to spin a couple of plays with accuracy to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), who managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the match already had a owner and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost to Olympiacos in Greece and ceded the lead of the Euroleague group B, in a match marked by losses of the cashiers, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and neither by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the home game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, with a fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function showing its superiority within both zones, where the injury loss of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez were weighing on the cashiers.
Between the infield and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triplets, they increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
A return that is impossible
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which made wobble the leadership of the group.
Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the drawbacks the Unicaja had to face from Cook's direction and triplets, and Lewis's contribution, it was still a bit hopeful 66-57, 31st minute.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when they were squeezing and given their superiority in centimeters inside the zone, they were unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to rebound the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the most classified ads for real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The How Much Should You Pay? tool calculates users' salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and the city where they wish to work.
In the week that the application has been running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels badly remunerated", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer earns 45,226 euros a year, and a French one, 31,059, compared with the 24,000 that a Spaniard receives.
Similarly, a driver is charged 34,247 net euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11.592 net euros per year; followed by that of employee, with 14.725 euros; and that of operator, with 15.667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian Government has given a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010, when his term of office would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date from the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, when his term ends, he has to look for another destination".
The broadcaster also cited the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the government of Brazil", Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylum which the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, uncertainty is again appearing in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by an uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly giving liquidity free bar at near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets for discounting.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its annual auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the differentials of corporate bonds have rebounded, although they are still far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is a flight to quality again and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing the spreads of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany to widen.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but Standard & Poor's came along and threatened a further downgrade of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad for silencing the moral risk advocates who were trying to re-create a charge of conscience on those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what should have been done is to decree a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, Dubai does paint a tribal struggle between the emirates to re-compile power in the emirates and Greece as we've seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It is not reasonable that the ECOFIN should save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to hold its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves in an episode of normalisation of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the range expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our government debt spreads are widening, as are European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European differentials are decreasing and ours are still widening, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote, when our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are back in charge with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not bode well for their warning.
Again, it looks like it's going to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "prudence, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is being debated.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushes of what he had raised in the subcommittee at doorstep.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50.000 million euros until 2020 and another 60.000 million between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the investment needed will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be directed to increasing capacity in generation but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes and power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW are needed, that is, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who considers the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the Government has just approved to be in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to do blood with the royal decree to incentivize the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of fighting climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán considers that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started now as they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' handling at 10 airports
Ferrovial's airport ground services subsidiary, Swissport, will act as the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at 10 European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been transgressed, is for a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Junta and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of collaboration to create the Innovation Center for Intelligent Infrastructures
The partnership envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% is for Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It is fighting for its first concessionary highway in Australia, a market in which it already operates as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at A$1.7 billion (about €1.047 billion).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5 km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
City Council wants it ready by the end of 2014.
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan overseen by Erns & Young, the Administration has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
The investment is expected to amount to 1.700 million Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the final phase three consortia with a notable presence of European builders are competing.
The group, which is called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish female in the league, and her teammates are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
The Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French builder Bouygues, plays against the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium to be closed is the LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which is in turn owned by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the civil engineering firm Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatisations, but it is clearly difficult to enter if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
This strategy has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief and Bilfinger, as well as Asian references, and continues to be a subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely achieved a position on that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, which owns Leighton.
Million assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalination.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to exploit synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground tollway, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link, is intended to connect the western Toowong motorway with the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along a 5 kilometre tunnel.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award date for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of the following year.
Although this payment passage would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be finished until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) to fund the project.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit for Hochtief, which announced yesterday that it has won a contract with the Government worth 154 million.
The ACS-participating company will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, enable the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fibre optic cable.
This action will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give the German woman work for 18 months.
The company also took over the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia, which was still to be built and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded a contract for EUR 64.5 million for the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The firm won the contract days after the 130 million extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria.
In this way Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The works are scheduled to start in early 2010 and will be carried out over a period of 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's publicity.
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore for an estimated sum of three million euros a year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms Rushmore was chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition organised by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined 63 million for curbing competition
France's competition regulator has fined France Télécom €63 million for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Commission, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the scope of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has in fact been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
App store
The French company's mobile subsidiary has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing non-voice-based revenues.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth clubs to have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it's also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this cast well.
The white club has been the third in the continent to have pocketed the most money for participating, and the only one, next to AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also made the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
Spain is the third country to have won more money through the Champions League, despite having won more titles than any other (five, four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution of the
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to invest €1.090 million in the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will allocate 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atletico Madrid) received 2,1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, plus another 550,000 euros for each match they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team).The eighth-place finishers will receive three million each; the eight fourth-place finishers, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, versus the finalist's $5.2 million.
In the case of fixed payments, a club will receive at least 7,1 million and a maximum of 31,2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main languages, and it has four places allocated.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allotted, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for the 29,9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday unveiled details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a tope of between 25% and 29,9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not oblige it to launch a public tender offer (opa) for the entire number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which would be paid out over 10 years and would be remunerated with an interest rate of 1% per annum on the deferral.
Yesterday, Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling bonds.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If the disbursement were to be made, it would amount to 611,7 million, whereas Sos's market capitalisation is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay out of the way of possible purchase offers and the judicial sway of their former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a top position in the food company.
This is a newly created position which will be directly dependent on the group chairman.
And it's not without controversy, as the company remains mired in the legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than $230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that in the coming months, the SOS will uncover further diversions of funds.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday they declared in the National Audience the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorises the exclusion of Paternina from the market presented by Inversora Mer
The National Commission of the Value Market (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion request submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation on the basis that its terms are in line with the rules in force and considers the contents of the explanatory memorandum submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December to be 'sufficient'.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is directed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, which represents 8,95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5.592.778 million shares have been immobilized, which will not be transmitted in any way until the completion of the offer, of which he specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, according to the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for car testing
In these days of storms and accidents, it's not just the car shops that win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repairs.
No accident is the same, and calculating parts costs and labour time can be a long and complicated task.
The cost of a repair, which is estimated to be between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, including parts and workmanship, can take two to three hours.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of the European
That's why almost 100 percent of the experts use these kinds of systems.
The service providers and solutions for damage assessment and maintenance are engaged in collecting the information supplied by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the North American Solera group, is the leading firm; 80% of valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation tools and the production of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's commercial director, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies them with information in different formats.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorisations have been launched than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very arduous task, for you have to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, each model is made into an "intelligent" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinned".
If it's a windscreen model, the work can be done in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three to four months.
The most exclusive models contain information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet in circulation, they are over 99%.
To carry out the documentation and the preparation of the databases, Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialised in a specific brand.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are entered each month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this huge flow of information enables these companies to make different uses of the information and to offer a variety of products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for scrap management or for calculating the sale or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
The products offered by Audatex make it easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, include the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid for by use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which does thousands of reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line with only its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the professional sector that allows bidding for vehicles declared to be a total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing deviations by model marks.
For example, it can be studied how many models of a given brand have been broken down or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the car.
The Gt Guideline on Valuations is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per annum over the last three years, and in 2008 they turned over EUR 10.8m.
At the beginning of last year they started their process of internationalisation, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, an increase of 3,3% compared with 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19,1 million euros, a 7,2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles that have been damaged.
The operation involved a disbursement of EUR 59,5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sale service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scrappers and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 transactions across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 advertisements daily and about 100 new advertisements are included on the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been revoked cannot be used again, but certain parts that are not damaged may be used as replacements.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been registered after some hard work.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the replacement, create a budget and generate a budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question is displayed and the necessary replacement is then selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an evaluation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working on making these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very happy about, because it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside.
