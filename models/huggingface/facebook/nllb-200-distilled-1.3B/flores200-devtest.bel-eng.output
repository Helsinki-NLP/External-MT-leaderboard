This not only supports the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that is not normally available from fossil studies, such as about the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown on top and pale or reddish-yellow on the back.
This discovery provides a new understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack the well-developed trunk of a rachis, but have other features of feathers, such as whiskers and beards, researchers have concluded that rachis was probably a late evolutionary change compared to other features.
Judging from the structure of the feathers, it's possible that they were not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or attract attention, and researchers have suggested that even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the patterns showed not the plumage of a chick, but the adult plumage.
The researchers suggested that although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern showed the grooming of an adult animal, not the plumage of a chick.

To witness each part of the process, candidates can refer their representatives, and in the evening, following a strictly controlled procedure, volunteers count the votes.

When Wouk pointed a gun at the head of the fifth soldier, it didn't work, and Schneider now suffers from constant pain and blindness in one eye, with part of his skull missing, and his face now partly made of titanium.
Schneider was giving testimony from his own country via video link, while he was stationed at a US Navy base.
In addition to competing on Wednesday, Carponeida took part in two more individual races.
She started in slalom, where she came out of the first race with 36 of 116 competitors scoring the same result.
She finished tenth in the women's slalom in a sitting position with a total time of 4:41.30 and was 2:11.60 minutes behind Austria's Claudia Lesch and 1:09.02 minutes behind the Hungarian Jongi Dani.
Four skiers from a group of disabled athletes failed to reach the finish line, and 45 of the 117 skiers failed to qualify for the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to their owners by the Madhya Pradesh police.
"We have arrested five men for raping a Swiss tourist and we were able to recover her mobile phone and laptop", said D.K. Arya, deputy inspector general.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar  are the names of those named as accused.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, police chief Chandra Shekhar Salanki said.
Even though there were three people in the car when it hit the house, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
While emergency services were rescuing the driver of a red Audi TT, traffic on the road where the accident happened was temporarily shut down.
He was first admitted to the James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeccoia has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, charged with the murder of her son.
She is awaiting indictment and trial, and is in custody, but given the number of times her photographs have been published, any eyewitness accounts can be questioned.
In other parts of the UK, this is common practice, but in Scotland, justice works differently -- courts believe that publishing photographs can potentially be harmful.
"It seems that journalists are taking a dangerous path when they publish photos of suspects", says Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Office of the High Court, which is responsible for prosecuting criminal cases, told reporters that at least until the indictment is presented, no further comment will be forthcoming.
According to the information obtained, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in a way that preserves the borders that existed before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
According to the information obtained, among other topics covered by the document  are issues of the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that the military presence in the valley be maintained for 10 years after the agreement is signed, while Palestine agrees for only five years.
The shooters who took part in the supplemental animal outbreak control program had to be under close surveillance by rangers because the program was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, in partnership with the Sport Shooting Association of Australia, Inc. recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program, which is run under the auspices of the Sport Shooting Association.
Mick Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's National Park Heritage and Conservation Service, said the four shooters selected for the first shooting were given comprehensive safety training.
Martelli swore in a new nine-member Temporary Electoral Council yesterday.
This is the fifth election of the Provisional Council of Martei in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Interim Electoral Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
The major anti-regime protests that began in October, Martelli responded with a commission.
The occasion for the sometimes violent protests was the absence of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEIP), the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of the use of the equipment, they had information.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it had received reports from Apple of 34 new cases of overheating, which it identified as "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report a matter of deep regret.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
Officials from the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage or accidents in the country.
In addition, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in Manila and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Roland Mendoza fired on the tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six were confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including elderly and children, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The old lady needed to go to the bathroom, so the photographers took her hostage.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a physician.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins spent his free time studying the problem of preterm birth.
His research showed that the hormone injection accelerated the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to Xinhua news agency, government investigators found two so-called black boxes of flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was my first queen of extreme. My first manager. She passed away in the middle of the night two months ago. It's pretty original, like her. Luna was a strong woman", Tony Dreamer said.
Dustin Gold Runnels remarked, "Luna was a freak, just as much as I was -- maybe even more -- I love her and I'm going to miss her -- I want to believe she's in a better place now".
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, stated that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
34 percent of those polled said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of those polled, who thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent, who, on the contrary, thought it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and compete in three Commonwealth Games relay events, but his fitness is questionable: he has complained a lot about his health.
He couldn't take painkillers because they're prohibited at the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Missouri Central University, discovered the largest known prime number.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using different hardware and software by early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is thought that comets may have brought to Earth not only organic matter that can form proteins and serve as a source of life support, but also water.
Because comets have collided with Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
"Political babble and nonsense", he called the rumors.
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says that the NextGen system will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Traffic is not increasing, and trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking on the ground level, as there is no interchange.
The likelihood of having to play a game behind closed doors without the team's fans increased, as it could be that transportation was not enough.
A new species of bird has been reported to have formed on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of the new species took only two generations, although it was previously thought that this process took much longer. The emergence of the new species was made possible by crossing the endemic ground york (Geospiza fortes) with the non-native cactus ground york (Geospiza conirostris).
You can cast gold into any shape you want, you can roll it into thin sheets.
You can pull it out into a thin wire, which you can easily twist and weave, and you can also chop it up or roll it into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make this acid-base indicator from a little bit of red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The pH level in the test chemical is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as you know, a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir these two dry powders around until they are all together, and then make a ball of them with your wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers of the skin, and it feels weird, but it forms a kind of shell.
Almost every home in Harapa and Mahendjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In Greek cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewer systems have been found in Minoan-era houses.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths where men and women shared a bath.
You're using a satellite when you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away.
In space, the satellite receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back.
Scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere refracts light and distorts images.
To get a telescope or satellite into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, moving faster and easier -- that's the biggest thing the wheel has done for us.
He made trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
Below are the medium-sized cats, whose prey is also medium-sized -- they hunt both rabbits and antelopes and deer.
In addition, many small cats (including domestic pets in the wild) hunt and eat more numerous small prey  insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is that each cat occupies a niche, a unique function, and so they don't have to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most sociable of cats: they live in large flocks, what are known as pride parades.
The pride may include up to three adult males who are related, as well as up to thirty females and young.
In most cases, the females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion pairs and wolf packs or dogs is similar in many ways, the latter being able to behave much like lions (but not other big cats) in that they pose a deadly threat to prey.
A tiger can climb (but not so well), jump over long distances, swim, and pull with a force five times stronger than a strong man, as a well-trained athlete.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and no other cat can roar except for these four.
The roar of a tiger is more like a sentence of sharp, loud words than the full-throated roar of a lion.
The ocelots are eaten by small animals, and when they can, they prey on monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds, almost all of which are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that they hunt and find prey by scent, smelling footprints on the ground.
They have night vision, good night vision, and they move very confidently, hunting acelots, fusing with their environment, and attacking prey from their hiding places.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they came -- say, when moving across a river or a mountain range, or when such organisms migrate to a new island, so it's quite difficult to return back -- they often end up in an environment that's very different from where they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different traits or adaptations than what it had before.
The original population hasn't changed at all: it's still adapting.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals become less and less like the original population from which they split.
Thousands or even millions of years go by, and sooner or later, these two populations will look so different that no one will even think of classifying them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it actually means the emergence of new species, and it's an inevitable and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that we breathe, and they also consume the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants prepare food from sunlight through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build houses out of plants, we make clothes out of plants, we eat mostly plants, and the animals wouldn't survive without plants.
For their time, masosaurs were super-predators, so they were not afraid of anything or anyone except other masosaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there was an extra row in the upper part of its mouth, which meant that its prey was unlikely to survive.
It is not known exactly, but it is possible that it had a split tongue, and its diet consisted of large fish, turtles, and other animals, and it is likely that it also ate members of its own species.
Besides, he could jump on anything that went into the water; his tray was no match for a giant Tyrannosaurus rex.
While their food would not surprise us in most ways, some of the dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual, including wild boars, pollies, snails, and one of the rodents known as the nutworm.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate on their chairs, the rich had banquets where they ate and rested at the same time.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia later.
They didn't have potatoes, they didn't have tomatoes, they didn't have corn, they didn't have cocoa, and, to be honest, no one in ancient Rome had ever had a chance to try turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a temple that was their home.
The faithful offered sacrifices to their deities, and the priests tried to meet their needs by holding festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had an open courtyard and sanctuary that could be visited only by priests.
In some cases, temples were built with pyramid-like towers known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house didn't matter.
For the most part, the Jewish family lived in the open air.
Women cooked outdoors; shops were just open counters facing the street.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was of great value.
Greenland was not densely populated, and according to Norse sagas, Eric Rood was banished from Iceland for murder, and sailed west to Greenland, which he called the Greenland.
But whatever he found, the Eskimos were already there at the time.
There were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though each of these countries was Scandinavian.
When you watch the movie "The Treasure of a Nation", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
But that's not true, because even though it's actually written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, reads: "Original version of the Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The inscription in reverse is at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that a large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was folded for preservation early in its existence.
So it's quite possible that this recording was added there as a simple reminder.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, which was the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragon began, with the Allies landing in southern France.
The Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks, then moved toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people living and working together as a society.
The term civilisation is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is similar in meaning to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, all of which, in turn, say something about the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, the equitable distribution and sustainable cultural footprint.
Very often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving behind any significant historical traces.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States initially established a weak central government under the Treaty of the Thirteen Confederate States, which consisted of only the Congress.
Congress had no taxing power, and since no national executive and judicial branch existed, it relied on enforcing all laws with the support of government agencies, which were often not willing to interact.
It also lacked the power to overturn state tax laws and tariffs.
The Treaty of Confederation required the unanimous consent of all states to make changes, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy national football team, like Germany, is the second strongest national team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, hockey with a puck, ice hockey and Formula 1 are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians also taking part in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is often called an archipelago in terms of geography because it is a cluster or group of islands.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when its name was first recorded by European sailors passing by as Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practice of baking. The company hired Chinese workers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized western and northern Taiwan in 1683 and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government in 1895 signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Japan was transferred sovereignty over the island, and the latter ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main sites: Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
To give visitors a better idea of how most of the buildings around the edges of the complex originally looked, the last ones were rebuilt.
By 1976, about 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
So, the most popular still format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant format in the analog era.
This kind of film is still being produced today, but more importantly, its ratio of width to height is now used in the matrix formats of digital cameras.
It may be a little confusing, but 35mm is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Accordingly, the ratio of sides for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of whole numbers) is considered to be  3:2.
Similar or similar ratios of sides have many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often attacked and ridiculed, is a simple piece of advice that provides dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
If he is to be believed, the best place to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photo into vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
This was a period of European history that saw the Catholic Church rise to wealth and power.
For all the linguistic and cultural differences that existed, Christianity united Europe for more than a thousand years.
Everyone, from the king to the commoner, was under her pervasive authority.
The essence of one of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and suffering, and that is what church money is for.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and with this concentration of power and money, many question whether this dogma is actually being enforced.
Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the war began.
Embargo on the supply of vital military and civilian goods, while in violation of generally accepted international law, has been legally enforced by several international treaties over the past two centuries, but has proven to be an effective strategy.
Britain mined international waters to keep ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral ships.
Because of the lack of significant reaction to this tactic, Germany was counting on unlimited submarine warfare.
Among most citizens and countries during the 1920s, a mood of pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
Nations and peoples were determined to avoid this in the future, for they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he found a job at the Edison Company in New York.
Only four cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Bachelor (his manager from his previous job), were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to name epochs, and every stage in China's history, or every ruling dynasty, had a distinctive dynasty.
The dynastic rule was also divided into periods of disunited provinces and instability, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles who fought for the throne fought ruthlessly among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences, including the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the rise of nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged not to a single ruler but to the people as a whole.
Moreover, after the Revolution, all positions became open to all male candidates, leading to the most successful and ambitious candidates making their way to the top.
In the army, the same thing happened, because whereas before military ranks were assigned based on rank, now they are assigned based on skill.
Many other oppressed workers in other countries were also inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in questions that transcended the worldly life, and to meditate and contemplate, he often visited a cave on Mount Noor (translated as Light), known as Hira.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, provides a vivid glimpse of the spiritual ascent of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world  it is on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's very hard to find, even if you know it exists.
Except for the clear, beautiful skies above and the many mountains around, there's very little of the world to see and hear from the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to our time.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of many pyramids that were built to honor the late Pharaoh. It was built in the third century BC.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of Death in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, temples and tombs were dedicated to the wife and family of the pharaoh.
The upward-moving symbol for the loop looks like V, and the downward-moving  looks like a bracket or square without a bottom.
So, upward slope means you start at the end of the slope and you move it upward, and downward slope means you start at the end of the slope, where your hand holds the slope, and you move the slope downward.
A swipe upward usually produces a softer sound, and a downward swipe is louder and more confident.
You can mark your marks with a pencil, but remember, the printed symbols for the bow are there for a musical reason, and they're usually stored.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of frightened women from the marketplace forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie Th√©r√®se), and Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage, and on the way they were surrounded by a crowd of people whistling, moaning, and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the windows of the carriage when they were influenced by the crowd.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved to the queen, who was already scared to death, with the head of the Versailles guardsman.
The military costs of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the costs and interest on the bonds that were placed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States.
Undoubtedly, the primary achievement of the US imperialists would be the surplus profits that resulted from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand who the Templars were, we need to understand the preconditions for their creation.
The era in which these events took place is traditionally referred to as the Classical Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
First came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term technological determinism encompasses a range of practical ideas, from the push to advance technology or technical necessity to the clear understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic that underlies scientific laws and their embodiment in the field of technology.
Two common ideas are typical of most explanations of technological determinism: the very development of technology largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, makes intrinsic (rather than socially determined) impacts on society.
In particular, there is a suggestion that the use of cars is stimulating the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars is small, a national highway network is not economically viable, and new ways of production are being developed to lower the cost of ownership.
The high number of car owners is increasing the number of road accidents, which in turn is leading to the development of new medical techniques that can treat a variety of injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was characteristic of romanticism.
The Romantic era was a time when people were strongly influenced by the geography of their presence, and the culture and traditions that came with it over time, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, because they were in harmony with the place and position that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 CE, the city gained fame as an epicenter of luxury and maintained this status until about 1100 CE.
During the 12th century, its status as a luxury capital declined, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts, including spices and silk, which were valued much higher than what was offered on the Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople took over the title of fashion capital from Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style was between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The Byzantine culture first exerted a strong influence on clothing.
However, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years late due to slow communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style in the late Middle Ages, and the use of buttons to fasten clothes by people during the Crusades was one of the biggest events of the time.
In organic farming, we produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple and generally organic system, based on using seeds that are native to a particular ecological region, combined with seed recycling or other relatively simple techniques, with the goal of maximizing yields.
Many farmers historically have been organic farmers, and many developing countries still practice it.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who may feel socially excluded and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a subculture can be based on a variety of factors - linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging through distinctive and symbolic clothing styles, behaviors, and jargon.
To illustrate what socialization is and how important it is, the most commonly cited examples are children who were not fortunate enough to grow up in an environment of contempt, neglect, hardship or humiliation and abuse, and who were not socialized by adults as children.
Some of the Wildlings were kept in captivity for long periods of time (usually treated so by their own parents); in some cases, the absence of parental care was due to the parents' unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual impairments and deficiencies in the child.
Before they were abandoned or fled, the child may have been severely bullied or traumatized.
Others were reportedly kept as livestock; some were rumored to be alone in the wild.
When a child is fully raised as an animal, his behavior almost in all respects (except for physical limitations) mirrors that of the animal-breeder: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of design learning is to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an assistant that helps people learn new learning experiences, which can mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual, such as a teacher and a little plug in Microsoft Office.
The software has virtual assistants that are there to ask questions, give clues, and explain procedures that students or listeners might not be able to handle on their own.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, including abuse, neglect, and even coercion.
We can't let our children grow up without care, without education, without care, without care, but it happens.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to give foster children good health care, safe homes, kind and caring parents, and a stable education.
It is believed that the adoptive family must provide for all the needs of the child that were not met in the home from which it was taken.
The Internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the Internet provides additional opportunities for its use and to meet the needs of the audience.
For example, it has been suggested that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are strong motivations to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal engagement" and "constant connection" were also identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in studying audience responses to websites.
The video has led to important discoveries in the explanation of microexpressions -- which are facial muscle movements that last only a few milliseconds.
The claim includes that correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his book, "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage, without understanding the language, can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals -- like domestic dogs -- might also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
The 20th century research suggests that there are two foundations of genetic variability, namely, explicit and latent variation.
Mutations cause new genetic variations to be produced, and then selection removes them from the pool of variations.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination mix the variations in these two pools.
The savannah's plant resources cannot meet the amino acid needs of primates with a digestive system similar to humans.
In fact, when they fail to do so, the consequences can be severe, including malnutrition, growth depression, and inevitable death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins found in legumes and leaves, but if not cooked properly, they are difficult for primates like us to absorb.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of protein, rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily digested.
So, it shouldn't be surprising to find out that our ancestors solved their own protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption refers to the intentional awakening of a sleeping person during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
And you can do that by having a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not quite.
If you find yourself moving your watch in your sleep, try putting it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants based on biorhythms, before going to bed, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic)  this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A man's inner peace is inversely proportional to the stress of his body and spirit.
The more positive the life force, the lower the stress, the more complete the peace and satisfaction that everyone can enjoy.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, but the only obstacles in the way are our own negative emotions and our own tension.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, which were complemented by the MahƒÅyƒÅna path of love and a number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, combining meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all of humanity.
Kundalini yoga practitioners claim that to awaken Kundalini energy, the energy of enlightenment, they can do yoga poses, mantra, visualization, and breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a core part of Tibetan meditation practice, and visualizing different gods helps you clear energy channels, open up your chakras, and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, and the Soviet Union and the United States began to cooperate. After the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins  former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it was really fought by friendly armies, on battlefields all over the place -- from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
Polish defences were broken by 17 September 1939. Retreat and regrouping along Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in just one night these plans lost their meaning, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Cargo shipping is obviously the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the navy has been to make sure that their country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time, the enemy is not able to transport their people and goods.
The North Atlantic Campaign during World War II is one of the most significant examples of this idea, when the United Kingdom was trying to help the Americans move people and supplies across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the movement, using submarines.
Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain the same way it conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them to keep milk, wool, meat, and skin handy.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other pastures, often under the care of the Cossack herders, children or teenagers, who were herders, a practice that continues today.
In the 16th century, England had paved roads.
Although the rolling roads were only parallel wooden planks, they allowed drawn horses to move at a greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on existing uneven roads.
Slabs were used to hold tracks in place early on, but it soon became clear that tracks would be more efficient if covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons were more likely to wear out.
The first fully metallic rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and about two million years ago, with Homo erectus, people started walking upright.
The Australopithecines, their predecessors, did not usually walk straight.
Straight-walking Australopithecines have been found in fossils dating to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but it is possible that by 7 million years ago, the sachelanthrop was walking on two legs.
You can become more environmentally conscious, you can become part of the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future, the suffering is not too severe.
It often looks more like a symptomatic cure, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It's pretty obvious that human technological and scientific advances have dramatically changed the world, and that overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles have increased the number of problems.
After the Declaration was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to John Dunlap's printing house, which was a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made of what are now known as the Dunlop's Arrows.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one copy, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as the Dunlap broadsides) have survived, but the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and that it's still around today, but we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and their ability to fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But birds still share many characteristics with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs, and, like the T. rex, walk on two hind legs.
Almost all modern computers operate with binary-coded information.
Binary numbers can have only one of two values  0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may have no obvious symptoms, such as vomiting, which is a fairly common symptom that makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The first sign of internal poisoning is an open container of pills or toxic household chemicals.
The instructions for emergency medical care for this particular poison are to look at the label.
To refer to this group of insects, entomologists use the term –∫–ª–æ–ø in a formal sense.
The term came about because people had known for a long time that bed bugs were these insects that were highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both kissing and bed bugs are nest parasites, used to living in their nests or in their host's house.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, and it is a neurological disorder that primarily affects young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they already have.
Such couples may be able to give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the child's birth parents renounce their parental rights so that the child can be raised by other spouses.
The main goal of science is to find out through the scientific method the way the world works. In fact, most scientific research is done using this method.
An experiment (a test that is conducted to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and observing) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
The most important focus of philosophers and naturalists was on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were generally accepted at the time.
As the number of people who spoke Greek declined, the West found itself torn from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many of the biorhythms we see in animal behavior and physiology are heavily dependent on endogenous cycles, which are a result of the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have fixed periodic rhythms that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
Your body clock is a self-regulating process, and even when no external signals are coming in, it keeps going in independent, freely running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was tested in the Hershey and Chase experiment.
To implant their own DNA into bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA of a bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or they tagged the protein of a bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material that has the mutation, and whether the cells affected are germline cells, mutations can have a wide variety of effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited, but other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting different natural areas and areas, because they want to enjoy the common species and landscape, including enjoying the observation of flora and fauna.
Examples of things you can do in nature include fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks, and exploring ecosystems.
An example of this is the visit, study, and photography of orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People drive out of small towns every morning to go to work, and on the way, they are passed by other people who work in the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation cycle, everyone has a stake in some way in and supports a private car-based transportation system.
The scientific evidence suggests that the modern high-carbon economy has undermined the stability of the biosphere, which has been a major contributor to human evolution for the past two million years.
All the people in our society use public transportation, and most of them are not happy with their public transportation system.
In the developed world, you don't hear so many complaints about collapsed bridges or the quality of water.
Why are transportation systems such a constant source of complaints, why do they often break down, is it because transportation engineers aren't qualified enough, or is something more important going on?
The concept of traffic involves the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows presents a difficult problem, because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a rather consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows are usually characterized by a certain rationally determined sequence and can be roughly described using mathematical models.
To show more fully and qualitatively what a vehicle movement is, it was established how its three main parameters are related: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Having these connections helps you plan and design road facilities and deal with their operation.
The first animals to fly were insects, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators more effectively, and to find mates and food.
In most insects, the wings fold down along the body.
This allows them to hunt in various very small places to hide from predators.
Stratocytes and monotremes are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus, several thousand years ago, proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many held a different view - that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, because it's hard to say from the ground that it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest river on Earth, and it's the largest, with eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that enters the oceans from the rivers of the planet.
The Amazon River, which is fed by thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 kilometers long.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, it was never able to match the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has only about 800 inhabitants, making it the world's smallest independent country with the smallest population.
Italian is the official language of the Vatican's legislation and official communications.
Most people who work in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the people in the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Because the basic chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) occur naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools, people have known about them since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that said that all things consist of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it looked like four states of matter in the same order: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although his theory suggested that they could be transformed into other substances to become what we see.
In most cases, an  alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic components, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles of  atoms.
Atoms are so small that the dot at the end of this sentence can hold trillions of them.
And so, when the pencil came out, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the value of the pencil and its use declined as new writing techniques emerged.
People are texting on their computer screens, and they don't need a dashboard.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when it is replaced by something fundamentally new.
The principle of a plutonium bomb is to harness the energy of nuclear fusion, when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It's like a very heavy cart rolling up a hill, and the core splitting releases some of that energy.
Some atoms' nuclei are unstable, which means they tend to decay with little or no external impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side  about 100 km.
Under the moon's rays, the moon's crust is thinner, and under the high mountain, it's thicker.
The lunar seas may be longer on the nearer side of the moon, because there is a thinner crust, and, accordingly, the lava was easier to rise to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on what drives people or what attracts them.
These theories are based on the premise that people have certain needs and/or desires that they turn into internal ones and which they subjectivise (i.e. internalize) during adulthood.
These theories describe what makes people want to do what they do and what environmental factors can influence whether they will do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are two authoritative contents theories.
Basically, when leaders are leading their former colleagues, two types of behaviors can emerge: At one end of the spectrum, you're trying to be your boyfriend or your girlfriend.
Managers with this type of personality may have difficulty evaluating performance, making unpopular decisions, applying discipline, distributing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
The other extreme is when the individual changes beyond recognition -- the need to change everything the team has been doing before and to own it.
At the end of the day, it's the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
And often this type of behavior ends up in a fight between the leader and the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence for real teams should apply to virtual teams, but there are some slight differences.
Typically, virtual team members act as the contact center for the real-world group.
Since such teams can meet outside of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may be hard for local leaders to understand.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The leadership team that each member of the team is assigned to is called the invisible team, and it sets the standards for each member.
What is the reason an organization might want to go through the lengthy process of forming a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals of organizational learning concepts.
Creativity and ingenuity can be revealed when all available resources are used efficiently within the functional departments of an organization.
So a process that an organization uses when people are working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovation process that meets customer needs.
The leadership of your organization needs to create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning, and only then can an organization be innovative.
In Angel (2006), the continuum approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
Theoretical approaches to cognition research are backed up by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data, narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The new research we have is a testament to the strong relationship between brain disorders and human behavior.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, focal injuries, lesions, plaques, pathological changes and brain tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
New technologies are making it possible to explore the structure of the brain and the processes that are previously unknown.
And this gives us a huge amount of material and data to build simulation models, which in turn help us understand the processes that go on in our minds.
Although the term AI is often associated with science fiction, it's actually a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of computers.
Artificial intelligence research includes attempts to make machines automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
Examples include planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical issues, and facial, voice, and handwriting recognition.
They've split into disciplines that look at real-life problems and offer solutions to them.
Today, AI is used in many industries, including economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it's also used as a software component in some computer programs and video games.
Excursions are a big part of school learning, and teachers often take students to places where they can't get to by bus.
Modern technology allows virtual field trips, where students can visit museum exhibits, go to an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art, all without leaving the classroom.
Taking virtual tours together is also a great way to reflect on travel and share experiences in future classes.
Bennet School students in North Carolina, for example, create a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and they redesign it every year, but the old versions remain online in album form.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills. Although at first, students may struggle with grammar and spelling, this tends to change for the better as they have an audience.
Since students are usually the most intrusive audience, a blogger does everything possible to improve his style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also helps students to better understand the world around them, and the need to keep their audience interested inspires them and keeps them competent and interesting (Tota, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative activity that encourages students to learn more than traditional school approaches can.
If students use blogs properly, they will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active reaction to online materials will help students to define their own position on what other people have written, as well as express their own views on particular issues (Ora–≤–µ—Ü, 2002).
Ottawa  is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find many art galleries and museums that give you the opportunity to learn about the country's past and its present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, and to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
For this and many other reasons, tourists, immigrants, and others from abroad consider Ontario to be a typical Canadian province.
Large parts of its territory, further north, are sparsely populated, and some are almost desert.
To compare the population, this is a surprising fact: the number of African Americans in the United States is greater than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located off the east coast of Africa and belong to the Indian Ocean archipelago.
Madagascar is by far the largest of them, and it's like a continent in terms of biodiversity.
Almost all the smaller islands are either independent states or French possessions, and are famous for their luxury beach resorts.
Also, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
It wasn't until the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, that European influence and colonialism began.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Tourist women are advised to always say they're married, even if they're not.
It may also be useful to wear a ring (so that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that as a result of cultural differences, they may be exposed to behavior that they find appealing, like tourist harassment, handshakes, and so on.
Be firmly against men and be brave enough to stand up for yourself (despite cultural differences, that's totally unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House) after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dara el-Bajjah, after the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Near the Old City of Medina, you can quickly find places that trade traditional Moroccan crafts  leather goods, pottery, tadjins, necklaces and various toys, but all of them are exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda that is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma washed away lava from the Niiragongo volcano, submerging most of the city's streets, mainly in the city center.
Although Goma is a fairly safe city, it is worth doing a little investigation to see if there is fighting going on in North Kivu at any given time.
The city also serves as a base for climbing the Niiragongo volcano, and offers very cheap services for mountain gorilla watchers.
To get around Goma, you can take a Bodo-Bodo (a motorcycle taxi) and the standard (local) fare for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Timbuktu's relative inaccessibility, its name began to be used as a metaphor for faraway exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport, today, Timbuktu is a city of poverty.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sands, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates gave this city a lot of attention in the PBS show "The End of the African Continent".
Compared to the rest of the country, the city stands out even more because it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and has 14 ecoregions, each with a variety of animals and plants.
It is one of the country's most interesting sites and is also considered the most significant of South Africa's national parks.
As with all national parks in South Africa, the park charges daily entrance fees and an environmental fee.
It is also possible to purchase a so-called Wild Card  subscription, which gives you the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong is a borrowing of the name Hong Kong Island, which is a major tourist attraction.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong that form the architectural face of the city are a brilliant column diagram, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong are from the island to the opposite coastal city of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly laid out along the northern coast on arid land.
The area was colonized by British colonists in the past, so if you want to see the evidence of the country's colonial past for yourself, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
The Sundarbans National Park is named after the part of the Sundarbans forest that is located in India.
It's not just the mangrove swamps that are called forests, but some of the last remaining dry jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain are still there.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands or marshes.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, according to reports, 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are found in the region.
From the inter-district bus station (which is across the river) buses depart throughout the day, however in most cases they depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Djakar (which is in the district of Bumthang).
Because intercity buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days before the trip.
The comfortable and reliable small buses Coaster made in Japan serve most areas.
The route taxi is a comfortable and convenient way to get to places nearby, such as the cities of Punakha (trip cost  200 nglt) and Paro (trip cost  150 nglt).
The bridge that crosses the Ayapoque is a arch bridge connecting the banks of the Ayapoque River, which spans the cities of  Ayapoque (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-Luapoque (French Guiana).
The bridge is 378 metres long and consists of two lanes, each 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres, and the bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017, despite its construction being completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs crossing points.
The Guaran√≠, who lived as hunter-gatherers and also engaged in natural agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people inhabiting the territory of modern-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Payagua and the Guayuru, lived in the Chaco region and were dependent on hunting, fishing, and gathering to survive.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India", actually came into being in the 16th century when Spanish conquistadors met with the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a 300-year colonial period.
Paraguay has managed to maintain its identity since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
At other times of the year, you can watch tournaments and smaller-scale matches.
Information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for a polo match can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is worth the same as the British pound (GBP).
In the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the only bank in the entire country, which is in Port Stanley, across the street from the EFI West store.
In general, British pounds are accepted as payment anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also frequently accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on remote islands, but they may accept British or American cash; ask the owner in advance what payment method they have.
It's almost impossible to exchange local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
If it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, Montevideo is summer, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30¬∞C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer bar rarely drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes the temperature feel lower than it really is.
The precipitation is almost constant throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they don't need to be fed or disturbed. Wild animals remain wild.
The park management advises to keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and  25 yards away from other wild animals!
Buffalo, elk, horned bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attack, no matter how obedient they may seem.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because of the lack of proper distance, so please stay away from these large, wild, potentially dangerous animals.
Bear and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so don't wear or cook food that smells strong, and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city of just under 40,000 people on the island of Upolu.
Apia has been around since the 1850s, and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
The assassination of the supreme leader of Toupou, Tomass√© L√©alofi III, ended a peaceful assembly in the city that had been held during the Maoist-organized struggle for independence.
Because of the harbor on both sides of Auckland, there are a lot of beaches, and the most popular ones are in the three boroughs.
The North Shore Beaches are near North Harbor, and extend from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south along the Pacific coast.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, it's a safe place to swim, and most of them are in the shade of trees.
In the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier's (Auckland's central district), WaitematƒÅ Harbour is home to Tamaki Drive Beach.
It's another crowded family beach with lots of shops.
The main local beer is known to customers as Number One. This drink is simple, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is Monta.
There are many different types of French wines, but the best way to get them is to bring wines from Australia and New Zealand.
Local tap water is absolutely safe and safe to drink, but if you still have some reservations, finding bottled water is not a problem.
The idea of a "flatt white" coffee is foreign to Australians, but espresso is a small portion of black coffee, with cappuccino filled with cream instead of foam, brewed without milk.
Hot chocolate is exactly the same as in Belgium. Fruit juices cost quite a bit, but taste great.
Reef travel takes place year-round and in large numbers, but injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, we recommend that you follow the advice of the authorities, follow all the instructions, and listen carefully to the warning signs about the need to follow safety rules.
Cuban jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and near river estuaries north of the settlement of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark species avoid humans and so swim away from them.
Rumpy crocodiles mostly live in estuaries north of Rockhampton, not in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, as they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Often, travel agents deal with specific hotels, but you may be able to book other accommodations through a travel agent, such as camping spots.
Usually, travel agents offer package deals that include breakfast, a round-trip airport transfer, or even a combination of flight and hotel accommodation.
Also, if you need time to think about the offer or get any other documents (such as a visa) needed to get to your destination, the travel agent can hold your reservation.
It is recommended that you send your suggestions for changes or requests to a travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay at the venue, and the vast majority of attendees say that this is an extremely important experience.
You'll have to come early if you want to find a campsite near a music venue.
Remember, even when the main stage is over, there may still be sections of the festival where the music will be playing far north.
Families with small children can enjoy special campsites at some festivals.
We recommend checking your cabin when you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter -- crossing the Illyrian is often accompanied by a terrible noise and crackling, which is especially impressive for people with heightened sensory sensitivity.
The cruise program in St. Petersburg includes a leisure time in the city, and passengers on these cruises do not need a visa (see terms).
Usually, casinos make a lot of efforts to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and for this, casinos lack windows and clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment, all to keep guests in a good mood and not wanting to leave the casino.
In some places, alcohol is served at the bar, but all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober, because drunkenness interferes with clear thinking.
Snow, ice and negative temperatures  all of these things should be considered by anyone who is planning to visit the northern latitudes or cross the mountain passes.
Low traction on snow and ice roads makes it hard to drive as if the asphalt is just under the wheels.
During a snowstorm, you can put so much snow in a very short time that you get constipated.
Also, visibility may be limited by snowfall or windstorms or freezing ice or condensation of moisture on car windows.
At the same time, snowy weather and a cooling off are common in many countries, and traffic is not disrupted throughout the year.
The most popular tourist attraction in Africa  is probably safari, and for many tourists it is the most exciting moment.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a land journey, specifically a savannah, where one can see the beautiful African wildlife.
Certain animals, such as giraffes and elephants, tend to fit close to cars, and even standard equipment can ensure good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are best viewed through binoculars because they can sometimes be very cautious.
A hike lasting several hours or days is called a walking safari, also known as a bushwalk, fall safari, or footing.
The 2021 Summer Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021 with separate competitions being held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice -- the first time they were held here in 1964.
It can be a tricky situation if you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the move became known.
Cancellation policies may vary, however, as of late March, the cancellation policy due to the coronavirus pandemic generally does not cover July 2020, when the Olympics are due to take place.

Stremons hang from both sides of the saddle and are supports for the rider's feet.
They give the rider more stability, but there can be safety concerns because the rider's legs can get stuck.
If the rider falls off the horse, his foot may get caught in the steep slope, and in this case, if the horse starts to run away, he may pull the rider behind him, and to minimize the risk of this, you can take some safety measures.
First, the special shoes with high heels and soft, rather narrow soles worn by most riders.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have protective arches, which allow the rider to fall off the saddle when the rider pulls back the saddle belt.

Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it contains many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means that tourists and travelers have to repeatedly pass passport control and apply for visas.
At the same time, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
You can usually cross the border without going through passport control again while you're in that zone.
In the same way, if you already have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen country, which saves time, money and simplifies the paperwork.

You can't expect transgender people who haven't had surgery to be able to pass through a scanner without their dignity and privacy being violated.
A rip current, often seen on a reef or similar place, is the backflow from waves that are being deflected away from the beach.
The backflow is concentrated in several areas with great depths, which is due to the underwater topology, and there it is possible to form a fast flow to great depths.
The cause of most deaths is fatigue when people try to swim back to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it'll be easy to swim back.
Try to navigate to a place where you can't fall back into the current, and if your skills allow or you've been spotted, you can stay still and wait for rescue.

Finland is one of the best places to go snorkeling or kayaking, and it has thousands of lakes and thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelago.
You can do without a yacht on lakes and archipelagos.
While the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even paddle boats can provide a very different experience.
In Finland, boating is the national pastime, and statistically there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
You can see this in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but nowhere else (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
The most memorable cruise on the Baltic is the long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.

The obvious way to get into first or business class is to put a lot of money towards that privilege (and even better, have a company do it for you).
But it's not worth it cheaply: practice shows that compared to regular economy class you can pay four times as much as business class and more than eleven times for first class!
Basically, there's no point in looking for discounts on direct flights from A to B in first or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay the ultimate price for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
