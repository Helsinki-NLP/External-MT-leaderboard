not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a well-known theory, but it also provides details that fossils usually can't provide, relating to colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed speciality, called a rachis, but do have other feather features - spines and tiny spines - researchers concluded that the rachis was probably part of a later evolutionary development relative to other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but to regulate temperature or appearance. The researchers say that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows the feathers of an adult, not a young individual.
The studies showed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows adult feathers and not chicken feathers.

The work performed was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to mimic the observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
As the moon attracts the earth and thus causes the tide, so the Milky Way applies force to the Sagittarius galaxy.
scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter is around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and it's made up of lots of tiny particles.

below them are medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) who eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special skill that every cat possesses and why it does not compete with others.
Lion are the most sociable cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herd consists of one to three adult males in the line, as well as up to 30 females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act like wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and also very deadly in their prey.

tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard and jaguar. these are the only four cats that can roar.
tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of angrily shouted words.

They see very well in the dark because of their night vision, and they move very quietly. The whole species hunts prey by fitting in with their surroundings, and then they jump on prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, during a crossing over a mountain range or a river or if they cross to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations from what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they're still in need of adaptation as before.
n an, as anewpopulationadjusttoanewenvironment,it's beginningtolook less and less like otherpopulation
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Long jaws contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional row of mouth-covers, meaning there was no escape for any creature that came his way.
We don't know for sure, but she may have had a sharp tongue, and her diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and she may have even been a cannibal.
even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't grow up
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also ate some strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild pigs, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called the puff
The other difference was that, whereas poor men and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lie on their hips while they ate.
The ancient Roman cuisine may not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
n't had corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no old Roman had ever tasted purée.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each deity, considered to be the home of that deity.
The people would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was only accessible to the priests.

The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
The majority of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open cash registers facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
though, despite its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map to the treasure.

The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written backwards at the bottom of the document.

So it's possible that the note was added simply as a tag.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
The French were the ones who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the attack was called Operation Dragoon.
n 2 weeks, the Americans and the Free French have liberated southern France and turned their backs on Germany.
Civilization is one culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.

Civilizing culture means transferring knowledge across generations, a long-lasting cultural trace and equitable diffusion.
THE CULTURES OF THE WORLD
n the War of Independence, the 13 states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was the Congress.
congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies to enforce the act, which often did not cooperate.
Nor did he have the authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Members sought the full consent of all states before they could be amended, and states understood central government so readily that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!

Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in 1624 in southwest Taiwan, initiated a change in Aboriginal grain-producing practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control in 1683 of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.

35 mm is actually a bit confusing - 36 mm wide with 24 mm high.


The rule of thirds, which is often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the picture.
It is stated that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was in control.
The Christian religion has united the nations of Europe for over a thousand years despite their different languages and customs.
Her dominant power has affected everyone from the king to the common man.

The central body of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and because of this concentration of power and money many have questioned whether this rule is being respected.

Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in the cave that became known as Hira on MountNo (light) and meditated.
The cave itself, which has survived all the time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
Giza or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to a series of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
up  looks like a V, and down  like a comma or a square with the bottom missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the reel, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the reel) and pull the reel.
Upward humming usually produces a softer sound, whereas downward humming is louder and more declarative.

To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the establishment of the Order.
The time period in which these events occurred is usually referred to as the Medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).

"TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM" is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological instinct or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by the basic logic associated with the laws of science and their representation in technology.
two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has impactson societies that are inherent, not socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
though, the road network around the country is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning cars.
Car ownership also leads to more road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for repairing injured bodies.
Romance had a significant element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with these geographical areas emerged and they, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.

Its renowned epicenter of luxury began around 400 CE, and lasted until around 1100 CE.
The status of the Byzantine had fallen in the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more prized than anything the Byzantine market offered.
at the time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.

Self-sustainable farming is farming that aims to produce sufficient food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds from a particular eco-region in combination with a flower garden or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient in agricultural production, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together people with similar worldviews who feel they are being ignored by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often show their affiliation through specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behaviour and jargon.
one of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point out the few unfortunate cases of children who have been denied socialization by their adult developmental parents due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Some wild children were imprisoned (usually by their parents); in some cases the children were rejected because their parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical deficiencies.
abandoned children may have experienced violence or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
The rest are thought to have been raised by animals. Some are thought to have lived independently in the wild.
After being raised completely by nonhuman animals, the wild child shows behaviour (within physical limitations) that completely resembles the behaviour of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference towards humans.
project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding is a step ahead.
Scaffolding (supporting) is not a learning method, but a means of aiding individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is one form of help but he's also the little man in the Microsoft Office.
Virtual scales are embedded in software and are intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that might be challenging for the student to perform on their own.
children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is no care, no tenderness, no education, but it happens.
We feel the foster care system represents a safe zone for these children.
Our housing system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care should meet all the needs that were unmet in the home they were previously taken from.
Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access to benefits and satisfaction of needs.
andsocialization are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "continuous connection" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his paper, The Presidential Speech, suggested that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly judge honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
20th century research has pointed out the fact that there are two kinds of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection is the removal from a group of expressed variations.
segregação e recombinação misturam variações entre estas duas bases em cada geração.
A primate with a digestive system like humans, in the savanna, can have a hard time satisfying their amino acid needs from available plant resources.

The easiest plant resources available would be the proteins available in leaves and fungi, but they're hard to digest for primates like us unless they're cooked.
The food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a huge amount of proteins containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep apnea is the process of intentionally waking during a normal sleep period and falling back to sleep somewhat later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved using a relatively silent alarm clock which will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself setting the alarm again in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve taking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea which is a known diuretic) before bed, which will make the person get up to wet.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is the opposite of the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is present. Each person has the potential to find his or her absolute peace and contentment.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tensions and negativity.
Tibet buddhism is based on the teachings of buddha, but it is spread by the mahajana way of love and the many techniques of indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy in WWII, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
2 years after the war ended, the former allies had now become enemies and the cold war had begun.

The use of freight ships is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and large numbers of people across the ocean.
The Navy's job is traditionally to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the ability of the enemy to move their people and goods.
one of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the north atlantic campaign in world war ii. the americans tried to move troops and supplies across the atlantic ocean to provide aid to the british.

Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for their easy access to milk, hair, meat, and leather.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other grazing areas, and were often kept by goats, mostly children or adolescents, who are similar to modern-day shepherds. These methods of raising cattle are still used today.
Carriages were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull more loads than was the case on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.

It became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. The first railways with full iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transport was walking, people started walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus.
their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been observed in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.

Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information which is encrypted in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medicines or toxic household chemicals.

many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, are observed in a wide variety of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that keep on moving even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they tagged the DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or they tagged phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the particular part of the genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
only swollen cell mutations can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges falling apart.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave fairly consistently
In order to better represent traffic flows, links have been established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to search for food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't flap their wings backwards today are the fairy stallions and the water lilies.

Aristóteles, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
You can also have alloys that contain in small amounts nonmetallic elements, like carbon.

The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
like pushing heavy wagons up a hill. re-splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Thiner under the sea, thicker under the mountains.
on the near side, there might be more lava because the crust is thinner.
Content theories are about finding what drives people to behave or what attracts them.

This behavior often results in a disagreement between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a contact point for their physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"Invisible Team" is a management team to which each member is responsible. This team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One goal for putting the concepts of organisational learning into practice is innovation.
When all the available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organisation, creativity and genius can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process for meeting the needs of clients.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. So, they narrow down the field of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and brain tumors affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies has allowed us to observe and explore structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction context, it represents a hugely significant branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent machine adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
