The number of new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased rapidly in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The assumption that all cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will show similar symptoms in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, suggests that, although the prevalence of COVID-19 varies from country to country, it can spread rapidly in all countries.
In light of the experience in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to be prepared to accommodate the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will require intensive care, especially in intensive care units.
On 31 December 2019, a large number of cases of an unidentified respiratory illness were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the disease was caused by a novel strain of coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been referred to as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Currently available evidence suggests that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, such as co-occurring respiratory illness or shortness of breath, and most will survive.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes severe illness requiring hospitalization, while 6% of cases are severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations is 4%.
In this study, we will assess the overall COVID-19 outcome in each European/European Economic Area country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to the Hubei Province, China.
We will also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom with those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
As in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries and the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading in other countries in the same way as it did in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, a report by Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues, reported the first European cases of COVID-19 in accordance with the WHO definition.
In the European Economic Area (EEA), the first three cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020; they were reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and were returned to France.
As of 15 March 2020, there were COVID-19 cases in all 30 countries in Europe/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (UK), and as of 31 December 2019 and counting, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths from the disease, with Italy alone accounting for 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Collect the total number and total number of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the COVID-19 case numbers for each country, based only on official sources such as the Ministries of Health of the Member States, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, daily at 08:00 am.
The data was used to estimate the spread of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and compared with Italy.
In the case of COVID-19 active cases, we consider the 14-day COVID-19 critical period, which is the time period of COVID-19 prevalence, in each European Union/European Economic Area country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided the total number of cases per country as of 15 March 2020 at 08:00 am, compared to the Italian figures from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 prevalence in Europe/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
The 14-day COVID-19 case progression in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom is similar to that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For countries in Europe/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 outbreak peaked around 21 February and then reached a moderate peak around 28 February 2020 (More information).
This was mainly driven by the high number of cases in Italy, but in all European countries/European Economic Area, the number of COVID-19 cases was also rising at a similar rate (More information).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom compared to Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 08:00 am, 15 other European/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom had the same number of cases as Italy just 3 weeks or less earlier.
Our results suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases will increase sharply in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The overall COVID-19 case data suggest that the epidemic is spreading in a similar manner in other countries.
However, despite the differences in national standards, healthcare professionals will treat people differently, and there may be different definitions of disease in different countries and different laws to determine which patients should be tested for COVID-19, including for subsequent testing.
In early March 2020, Italian health authorities in the outbreak zone reported that 10% of COVID-19 cases required intensive care and media reports suggested that the intensive care units of regional hospitals were overcrowded.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and/or intensive care units are currently available in the European Union/European Economic Area for only 6% and 1% of the population respectively (data are not shown).
However, they must be carefully combined to complement the latest data on the number of cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a significant change in intensive care and medium-security beds in Europe, with 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have a higher or lower capacity than Italy (12.5 intensive care and medium-security beds per 100,000 in 201011).
Improving patient care beyond the medical field, with estimates for the entire European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom based on COVID-19 hospitalizations and a &gt;90% risk of beds being left unattended in intensive care, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Emergency Risk Assessment for COVID-19.
Because of the high incidence of cases in some parts of Europe/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and because intensive care units are often used to house a population from a specific region, data on cases and intensive care beds should be freely available in the so-called Nomenclature of Information Level 2 (NUTS-2) areas.
The latest data from Italy and other countries suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in Europe/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to respond to the large number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases seeking treatment, especially in intensive care units, such as those in the Italian regions affected by the disease.
As highlighted in the recent ECDC Emergency Risk Assessment, a fast, efficient and effective approach is essential to prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, distract from the infection rate and focus on reducing the cost of contamination; as predicting the prevalence of infection will not be an effective decision-making tool and hospitals will not have time to understand, respond to and respond to the disease unless it is first tested.
Emergency risk assessments also address public health measures to slow the spread of the disease.
There is little chance that countries will have the opportunity to step up their efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and put pressure on healthcare.
If this is not done, health systems in other European/European Economic Area countries will have to deal with a significant increase in the number of cases requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, making it a major public health threat.
In addition to its cousin, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have originated in bats and has similar symptoms and transmission patterns.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lethal than SARS but is more transmissible and affects older people more than younger people and is more common in men than women.
As the literature on this disease continues to expand, the purpose of this article is to provide timely information and to discuss the research activities that will be carried out in this field.
We will discuss key aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope this article will help you to understand and treat this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and memorable event for all Chinese, as they were ordered to stay indoors for the entire festival and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new outbreak.
The virus is closely related to the coronavirus (CoV) that was the cause of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The deadly disease originated in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 new cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 cases of recovery and discharges and more than 3,000 deaths.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one threat to humanity" and may be more serious than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, women have published more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 describing the transmission of the virus in the general population.
This article will attempt to summarize the research that will be done on this new and rapidly spreading disease.
If possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another CoV-related disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned about the treatment and prognosis of this disease and other important questions.
CoVs are reported to be relatively harmless, typically causing up to 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have seen two virulent CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and spread rapidly to other countries with high infection and mortality rates.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV to emerge in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a group of respiratory illnesses of unknown origin was first reported in Wuhan on 31 February 2019 by the Chinese National Health Administration.
Seven days later, the development of the CoV was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first case was reported in Wuhan.
At that time, the disease spread rapidly through cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On the 20th, the doctors announced that the virus had been identified, indicating that it could be transmitted from person to person.
On 23 January, Wuhan was sealed off and public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, when the outbreak was first detected, only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases were reported from a Wuhan seafood market where the outbreak was caused by an unidentified animal.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the disease a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
Because of their rapid evolution, their ultimate size and strength are still unknown.
As of 11 February 2020, a study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 positive COVID-19 cases has reported updates to the epidemiological status as described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but is most common in people aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years of age, with a small minority under 20 years of age, and only 14 cases were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 was more common in males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in communities mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to date of diagnosis.
The average time to onset of symptoms is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The incidence rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the variability of R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of new cases increased significantly before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The overall mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the variation in mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and respiratory distress.
CoVs are part of a large family of viruses and are among the most common viruses that have some RNA affinity.
They can be divided into four categories, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The (S) glycoprotein spike binds to its angiotensin receptors and catalyzes the enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) reactions for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, followed by membrane fusion.
Viral RNA is secreted into the cytoplasm; after viral replication, viral RNA enters the glycoprotein envelope and nucleocapsid proteins form virion-containing vesicles, which fuse with plasma to form the virus.
The first genome of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a novel beta-CoV with a 99.98% blood identity in 10 samples collected from the initial outbreak site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV but not to MERS-CoV.
Through electron scattering microscopy, fragments of SARS-CoV-2 are detected in the respiratory tract of humans.
Human ACE2 was identified as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less strongly bound to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is less likely to cause human disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a new small protein derived from orf3b and produce a protein derived from orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b gene may play a key role in the emergence of this virus and the expression of IFNβ symptoms; however, orf8 has no known function or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and colleagues, reported that the cryo-EM body of a very tall human ACE2 at 2.9 Å complexity contained the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that these complexes, which were open and closed, were linked together and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provide the key to identifying CoV and the disease.
B0AT1 may be a potential drug target for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Origin and the Secondary Residence
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via civet and camel mosquitoes.
Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs were made in bats, whereas humans were the primary transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 because the novel virus was 96% identical to the two SARS-CoVs from bats, SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the mechanism that enabled the virus to move from animals to humans is still unknown, and we do not yet know how it got there.
Ji and his colleagues suggested that snakes transmitted the virus from bats to humans, and it was incorporated into the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, identified pangolins - mammals commonly used as herbal remedies in China - as the likely secondary hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% blood-to-coronavirus similarity found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two viruses is still a significant difference; therefore, we will continue to wait for a definitive conclusion (No. 33).
The physiological and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive outside their natural habitat for up to 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It is estimated that SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; or, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other antibiotics, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively kill the virus.
All humans are immune to SARS-CoV-2, so they are susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there is no comprehensive research on how to control SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
Typically, when a virus infects a tissue, the immune system recognizes it by specific receptor recognition (PRRs) including its type C vector, Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-like Toll-
Through a variety of mechanisms, the virus causes inflammation, develops dendritic cells, and briefly binds to interferon-like I (IFNs) that inhibit viral transmission and accelerate the release of antibodies.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to evade the influence of the pathogenic immune system.
In recent years, the virus's antibodies have become more and more integrated.
T-lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the infected cells immediately.
Helper T cells produce cytokines that produce a receptor to help fight the immune system.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function in a T cell death pattern.
Combined antibodies such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in the fight against this virus.
For example, antibodies removed from survivors killed MERS-CoV.
However, an overreaction of the immune system can produce an excess of radicals in the body that can damage the lungs and other organs, and worse, cause multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is initially transmissible, is more common in older people with other infections and pregnant women.
People who are exposed to high levels of viruses or whose immune systems are weakened are often at higher risk of infection than others.
The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with a peak of 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 subjects showed that the average onset of symptoms was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as mentioned above, found that the average time to onset of symptoms was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) for 8,866 people.
It is important for healthcare providers to adjust the quarantine period to reflect the actual time of the disease, thus preventing people with symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As is often the case, people who have had contact with or have been exposed to the virus require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine be 24 days?
Fever is often the most important and early symptom of COVID-19, which may be present either alone or with other symptoms such as severe cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, burning pain, sore throat, nasal congestion, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience painful breathing and/or shortness of breath for a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients developed rapid respiratory distress, heart failure, high levels of acidity, and blood clotting problems.
People with fever and/or shortness of breath and severe fever, even if suspected of having a lung disease, should be screened for the disease.
A small population study conducted in late December 2019 showed that symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for cough, 55% for vertigo, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of the population required ventilation.
Similar results were obtained in two recent studies of pathogens and their spread to non-infected populations.
However, a 2012 study found that the majority of MERS-CoV patients had fever (98%), severe cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) among the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required air-conditioning, more than the number of COVID-19 and MERS-related deaths but less than the number of COVID-19 cases.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
Among patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), severe cough (29%-75%), dizziness (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were found to be the most common symptoms and about 14%-20% required ventilation.
As of 14 February, the COVID-19 death rate was 2% while the global death toll was 66,576.
In comparison, SARS deaths in November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 cases.
In the case of MERS, the mortality rate was 37 percent of the 2,494 cases reported in June 2012, according to a census.
Preliminary studies have shown that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are shown in Table 1.1 of Table 1.
The above statistics suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to be transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has a lower mortality rate than the latter two.
As a result, the infectious disease of SARS-CoV-2 is more difficult to control than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Packages are usually shipped from a single family or location or by ship.
Infected cases are generally individuals who have traveled to, lived in, or been exposed to an outbreak or human contact within the last two weeks before the outbreak.
However, it is likely that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and are discharged from hospital may be re-infected, so the quarantine period should be extended.
Patients with normal or low white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) at the early stages of the disease.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count &lt; 4×109/L plus a lymphocyte count &lt; 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia have been observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated liver and vascular enzymes and myoglobin levels, and many patients had elevated C-proteins and erythrocytes.
In the severely ill, the level of dimer D, a weakening of a blood vessel, increases, and the lymphocyte count begins to decrease.
Chest pain has been reported in many COVID-19 patients and has been associated with a variety of dark spots or dark patches on the lungs.
Patients often had respiratory illness, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, severe pain, increased fluidity, and fibrosis cause respiratory distress.
Impaired function of type I and II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases the inflammatory response, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to open and increasing the risk of lung infection.
As a result, severe lung disease was often associated with severe pain.
On 18 February 2020, a preliminary analysis of COVID-19 showed damage to the pneumocytes, hyaline sections, and internal lymphocyte ruptures, as well as some cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease; this is consistent with the pathology of the virus and ARDS and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR has been used as a key indicator for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false positives, which can exacerbate the spread of the disease, the use of diagnostic diagnostic tests (not limited to RT-PCR) in China began on 13 February 2020.
A similar process was used to detect SARS.
Therefore, combining the history of the disease, the prognosis, laboratory tests, and radiographic data is important and will help to make a more accurate diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Association presented a method using the CRISPR SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L or 200 × 10-18 mol/L (numbers 10-100 per microlitre) using a gauge in less than one hour without any complicated procedures.
Hopefully, this new technology could dramatically change the sensitivity and effectiveness of its use, if approved after a review.
Due to the lack of knowledge about novel CoVs, clinicians may only provide limited treatment to COVID-19 patients while waiting for a range of therapies that women already use or were previously considering to treat patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and viral infections (Table (Table2).2).
These drugs are new and potential drugs that include herbal medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, human plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and medical supplements.
It has been suggested that even plasma from a patient may be used as a medicine.
Pharmaceutical companies will work hard to develop vaccines and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and sometimes attacks other parts of the body that are receptors to ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory distress and memory loss are major risk factors for many patients and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory therapy is essential for alleviating symptoms and for recovery and includes medication, oxygenation, inhalation, and oxygenation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress were treated with an ECMO, a novel heart transplantation technique used to treat severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary and severe disease, and maintaining vital organs are essential for people infected with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that elevated cytokine levels are associated with an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokines are a type of inflammatory cytokine that is produced by several cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
Cytokines stimulate the immune system to produce a wide variety of different radicals that often cause ARDS and organ damage.
Immunosuppressants are essential for cytokine survival, especially in patients with severe disease.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 antibody, were used to treat cytokines.
Other immunosuppressive cytokine therapies include the use of antibody-associated T cells; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine-induced 4-receptor suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used as SARS treatments to alleviate the pain caused.
However, high-dose steroids were not relevant for lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, it can cause other complications, especially with blood cells, and has severely impaired prognosis.
However, low doses of corticosteroids are recommended for patients with severe COVID-19 infection.
At the time of writing, there is no known cure for this virus.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been shown to be more effective in American patients with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is an antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg patients.
Remdesivir was later shown to be effective against other RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
In light of these findings, Gilead has provided the kits to China for testing on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinbe, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been reported to be effective in treating patients with severe respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur when this medication is combined with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Combinations of these drugs with other drugs used to treat certain patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from survivors and antibodies
The use of blood from survivors of infectious diseases to treat other people with the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection has a long history.
In fact, survivors often have strong antibodies to the virus in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight bacteria and other pathogens and to recognize and then kill the bacteria molecules.
Based on these data, plasma is typically collected from COVID-19-resistant patients and collected from 10 critically ill patients.
They recovered within 24 hours; the virus's symptoms decreased and the oxygen levels in the blood were maintained.
However, verification and clarification are essential to suggesting the use of this method for clinical use before a real treatment is developed.
In addition, because of the potential for adverse effects, some of the risks of plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune system and trigger the production of cytokines, which are potentially life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies to fight the epidemic.
Therefore, it is important and appropriate to isolate B cells from survivors and determine the potency of these antibodies or to carry them to determine whether these antibodies can fight viral proteins.
This will allow us to produce antibodies more quickly.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions in China for centuries.
However, the risks are due to the combination of many different factors depending on the nature of the disease in accordance with TCM concepts.
Many useful substances are unknown or only partially known because of the difficulty of producing and verifying these substances and the proper combination of the ingredients.
Currently, with no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become a popular treatment option for people with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe illness.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 treatment were reported in several Chinese provinces where TCM was used in 87% of cases, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only about 30% of COVID-19 cases, the recovery rate was only 13%.
However, this comparison is difficult because other factors such as the number of cases and the severity of the disease must also be considered during the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing European Medicine (EM) alone with EM and TCM.
They found that the time required for hypothermia, symptom resolution, and hospitalization was shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
More surprisingly, the incidence of symptomatic exacerbation (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still to be confirmed after large-scale clinical trials in many areas.
It will also focus on understanding the mechanisms and explanations of the potency of TCM compounds or their combinations where possible.
People who are suspected of having or have had COVID-19 are often more likely to be at risk of the deadly disease, and people who are quarantined are more likely to experience anxiety, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, lack of oxygen, and cough and other medication-related symptoms such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
Early in the SARS outbreak, it was reported that the subjects showed a range of symptoms including severe depression, anxiety, shock, irritable bowel syndrome, memory loss, dementia, and even suicide attempts.
Contact tracing and quarantine to protect against COVID-19 can lead to increased anxiety and guilt over the spread of the disease, quarantine, and distress to family and friends.
Therefore, they should provide personalized care to people with COVID-19, those suspected of having it, and to anyone who needs it.
Human epidemiology should focus on selecting a multi-disciplinary team of human epidemiologists, regular and open communication and up-to-date information on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and on the development and use of tools and software to avoid isolation.
Authentic vaccines are essential to halt the spread of the virus from infected animals and humans to other organisms and are often compatible with antiviral drugs to combat the emergence of new viruses.
Efforts will be made to develop vaccines from S-protein to produce long-lasting and potentially lethal antibodies and/or protective measures against SARS-CoV.
Women have tested a life-sustaining vaccine for SARS in animals.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in elderly and seriously ill patients and their protection against animal-derived viruses are not yet known before the start of real human trials.
This is probably because SARS was discovered 17 years ago and no one else has been infected since then.
In contrast, individuals and small groups of people will continue to be infected with MERS in the Middle East and spread to other areas through animal transmission.
Women have experimented with developing MERS vaccines by killing the virus, cell DNA, viral vectors, microorganisms, viral-like substances and viral protein fragments and other animal tests.
Developing effective and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised populations is critical and a critical step in preventing the spread of the pandemic.
However, the challenges are difficult to overcome because of the long time (about 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the high prevalence of CoVs.
As a relatively new disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show its effectiveness in a small number of cases.
In most cases, patients may recover gradually without remaining symptomatic.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is both a potentially life-threatening and life-threatening disease in those who are severely ill.
Therefore, modeling for diagnostics is essential for physicians to prioritize their work, especially in areas where expertise is limited.
Based on the human studies of women, the following factors may influence or be related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Table (33)):
Rainfall: Rainfall is an important factor in SARS prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was primarily reported in people aged 30-65 years, as 47.7% of the cases were over 50 years of age in the study of 8,866 participants as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care showed more severe symptoms and pain and lived longer than those without symptoms (average age 66 and 51 years), suggesting that age is a key determinant of survival in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males than females (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Other symptoms and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to experience respiratory distress and heart failure.
Heart disease was also a leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be similar to ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and chronic illness are closely linked and can interact.
Laboratory-based disorders: Blood levels of CRP indicate the severity of the artery pain and are thought to be a factor in the development of the disease, which is important for treatment and, ultimately, survival.
The relationship between CRP severity levels and COVID-19 prognosis was also discussed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may play a role in determining survival.
These enzymes are produced in high concentrations in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are produced when tissue is damaged.
Thus, it is often the cause of heart or liver failure.
Severe symptoms: Chest X-rays and mild progression of symptoms should be considered along with other factors to determine survival and risk of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as a treatment for viral infections to reduce pain.
Because of the high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed anemia and had life-long disabilities and poor health.
Therefore, low-dose and short-term steroid use should be recommended for COVID-19 patients if necessary.
Depression: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many people developed depression due to prolonged quarantine and severe depression and witnessed the death of family members and other patients.
Providing medical advice and long-term support is essential to help patients recover from these stresses and return to a normal life.
Based on the studies of women, it appears that COVID-19 has some of the same features as SARS.
In addition to being transmitted mainly by the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by the upper respiratory tract and produce mild or no symptoms at the onset of infection, similar to other common cold-causing CoVs.
Therefore, people with early or pre-epidemic infections may be more likely to transmit viruses during daily activities, making it more difficult to control the disease.
However, SARS-CoV is likely to be transmitted in the most severe cases, but no major transmission occurred at the beginning.
As a result, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
Efforts will be made in China to limit travel to Wuhan and surrounding cities and to continue the nationwide quarantine in the hope of preventing SARS-CoV-2 from spreading to other populations.
Despite the economic and social impact of these efforts, the number of new cases would decline, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The best estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the cooling period will last 3-4 months.
However, some scholars disagree.
Paul Hunter, and colleagues, believe that COVID-19, which is predicted to be more infectious than SARS, will not be eliminated by 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and estimated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reports that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the saliva and throat of patients who had been discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the novel virus may become a recurrent illness similar to influenza.
However, positive signs have been seen in China as the number of new cases decreases, suggesting that current measures are working.
Initial estimates put the death toll at between one and half a million.
But with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is finally being defeated.
It is also possible, as in the case of SARS-CoV, that the resistance of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and eventually become extinct or non-viable for humans.
Comparisons between COVID-19 and SARS and MERS are shown below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly by coughing or sneezing, and possibly by contact with previously infected objects.
The virus was also found in the feces, suggesting that it may have been introduced from the feces into the mouth.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of patients did not have a hospital-associated illness, including 17 patients with other medical conditions and 40 doctors or nurses.
Therefore, we must take strict measures to protect people, especially doctors, health care workers, family members, friends, and even neighbors who have come into contact with infected people.
The primary defense against infection is the wearing of a mask; the use of a medical mask and a N95 respirator (number # 1860s) will help to prevent the virus from spreading.
A medical mask prevents fluid from the infected person from escaping into the air or from sticking to objects, where it can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (number # 1860s) can protect against at least 10 to 80 nm of virus, and only 5% of the virus can be fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Because of the potential for contamination by mixing five medical masks together, contact physicians should wear N95 masks (number # 1860s) instead of medical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear appropriate clothing to reduce the risk of infection.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his aching eyes.
Therefore, doctors should wear a white mask or glasses when treating patients.
For all people who have been in or may be in contact with the virus, it is important that they wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors by self-quarantine and avoid contact with people who may be infected.
Two meters is the appropriate distance people should be kept from an infected person.
Taking these steps is an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the virus from spreading.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in the human world, it is very similar to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020, which should have caused a lot of alarm in China as the SARS outbreak in 2003 is well known.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the public by stating that the new virus is highly transmissible and has a low rate of human transmission and is difficult to contain and eliminate.
The news caused a public outcry, especially as the country prepared for the Spring Festival, and they missed this crucial moment in containing the outbreak in Wuhan.
The Chinese Epidemiological Society may learn from this lesson and make appropriate changes in the future.
For example, these should (1) be more careful when speaking publicly because they can influence public opinion and decisions; (2) be more vigilant and attentive to medical information than to medical or official reports; (3) take strong action to combat epidemics in their early stages rather than try to convince people; and (4) develop a more effective and effective reasoning system to help people better understand epidemics and diagnoses and plan for response to such emergencies.
The COVID-19 outbreak from the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world as we write this.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and its symptoms are similar to those of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has been described as a SARS resurgence.
However, there are also significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for preventing the disease and saving patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults more often than younger adults and males more often than females, and is more severe and fatal in older adults than in younger adults.
SARS is expected to be more lethal than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 cases transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms, while SARS cases only transmit the virus in severe cases, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This may partially explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more widespread and localized than SARS-CoV.
If we test for normal SARS-CoV-2 RNA, there may not be any additional cases of COVID-19.
However, those who recover can be infected again.
These factors significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading more widely.
To ensure that COVID-19 research progresses as quickly as possible, there are several key areas that need to be improved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although 96% similarity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS CoVs derived from bats, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animals did the virus transmit from their natural habitat, such as bats, to humans?
Without the answers to questions #1 and 2, it is impossible to prevent the spread of the disease, and it can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, is there any evidence that the virus enters the upper respiratory tract and causes mutations?
Does the virus also interact with ACE2- in other organ cells?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot determine the most effective and effective treatment.
How long will the disease last?
How does the virus spread in the bloodstream?
Will it become a global pandemic, a permanent outbreak like SARS or a recurring outbreak like influenza?
It is important but can take time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
But no matter what the cost, we can only prevent the pandemic and restore our lives to normal.
Human coronavirus from animals
The mutation and adaptation process allows the coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, to thrive for many years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) highlights the potential for human infection and death from HCoVs.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has placed CoVs at the forefront of the spectrum and has been surprisingly fast-spreading but less virulent than its SARS-CoV cousin.
HCoV infection is transmitted from animals and identifying the animals that have transmitted HCoVs will also be helpful.
Most HCoVs originated from bats but are not pathogenic.
Intermediate carriers of other HCoVs are also known.
Identifying the animals that carry the disease has a significant impact on the fight against human disease.
Research into the relationship between animal-to-animal CoV vectors may also be important in the identification of human CoV infection.
In this article, we will summarize what we know about seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history and their animal and viral origin.
The main advantage is that we compare and differentiate many HCoVs based on viral maturation and genome sequencing.
The current 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) is discussed in this article.
It also discusses the requirements for successfully modifying disease causation and causation as the virus develops and becomes more aggressive.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of highly conserved RNA viruses.
Viruses with large genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses were named CoVs because they had a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope.
In the human body, CoVs do not have identical genomes.
Approximately two-thirds of genomes contain two open subunits (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1 and pp1ab protein complexes.
Many proteins are also used to produce 16 proteins called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for protein bodies, including spike (S), membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Specific proteins are also coded for in different CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequence, CoVs are classified into four main subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), and beta-CoVs are composed of multiple HCoVs and are further divided into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence suggests that bats and mice are the primary gene source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, but birds are the primary source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over millennia, CoVs have been found frequently in the food web and some have become virulent human viruses.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The remaining five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually have mild symptoms, such as a cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly emerged SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains are more aggressive, severely restricting the lower respiratory tract in many patients at high risk of developing acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and other lung conditions.
The first evidence of HCoV-229E, B814, was collected from nasal swabs of patients with a cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more research has helped to identify HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which are mildly symptomatic.
In fact, the idea that HCoVs are harmless was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the deadliest epidemics of modern times, with more than 8,000 deaths and nearly 10 percent of the population infected.
Within a decade, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) became a major epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and slowly spread throughout the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), also known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of 3 March 2020.
A global warning has been issued and the world is preparing for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs originated from animals, including bats, mice, or other domestic animals.
Most evidence suggests that all HCoVs originate in bats, where the viruses are primarily host-resistant but have a wide variety of forms.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on medical care, science, social and cultural life in China and globally.
Tracking the animal origins of HCoVs is helping to understand the evolutionary history, regulatory power and controls of these organisms.
It may also guide or assist in the identification of the habitat, transmission and management of the organisms that carry SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to prevent future outbreaks.
This article provides a brief overview of the origin of these animals, their transmission patterns and the HCoVs.
In particular, we are highlighting and highlighting the important fact that the main HCoVs do not cause disease in their native habitat but become pathogenic when they migrate from one species to another.
We also discussed how HCoVs evolve and how frequent interbreeding reduces their transmission.
The outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this article.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first detection of HCoV-229E, B814, in the nasal passages of people with a cold, CoVs had already been detected in several animals, including turkeys, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past few years, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of HCoV sequence detection (Table 1) will be useful and informative.
HCoV-229E was first identified in respiratory samples from patients with a foot-and-mouth disease in 1966, and subsequently developed in WI-38 lymphoma cells.
Patients with HCoV-229E had a high incidence of cold symptoms including fever, sore throat, and sore throat with fever and cough occurring in 10~20% of patients.
In addition, the HCoV-OC43 was found in the human genome in the early 1970s.
The symptoms of HCoV-OC43 appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is highly similar to respiratory infections, such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have been reported worldwide, and are most commonly transmitted in the winter.
The time between two active viruses is usually less than a week, and the onset of infection occurs in about 2 weeks.
According to a free human trial, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have a higher incidence of colds.
Only a small number of patients with poor health have developed severe respiratory distress.
SARS, also known as pneumonia, was the first literature-based HCoV to cause a pandemic in human history and was derived from SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be identified by humans.
The first case of SARS was reported in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
SARS infected 8,096 people and caused 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
Apart from the cause, it was found that the infection rate was about two-thirds of the time, with the incubation period lasting 4-7 days and the peak intensity on the 10th day.
People infected with SARS-CoV initially experience muscle pain, burning, fever, chills, and chills, followed by shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath.
Lymphocyte depletion, impaired immune function, and increased creatine kinase are among the most common SARS symptoms.
Alveolar degeneration, premature epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophage production are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of those infected will be admitted to the intensive care unit and will require ventilation.
In addition, under the respiratory tract, many organs such as the digestive tract, kidneys and kidneys can be damaged in severe cases, often leading to an increase in cytokines, which can lead to death in people with poor health.
The virus was first identified in a skin test of a relative of a patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been significant advances in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was previously found to be more common in younger people, the elderly, and those with poor health and respiratory problems.
Nose symptoms, conjunctivitis, fever, and respiratory illness are common in infection with HCoV-NL63.
Another study reported that the virus was isolated from the nasal swabs of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it spread to all.
HCoV-NL63 is thought to cause approximately 4.7% of respiratory illnesses, with most cases reported in early summer, rainy season, and cold winter.
HCoV-NL63 also causes respiratory laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 appears to be associated with severe asthma.
As with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected globally, causing human respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs are highly pathogenic to humans and are generally rare due to their mild pathogenicity, although the incidence was due to unknown causes and in rare cases to a highly pathogenic strain of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause mild respiratory illness in China.
In general, when HCoVs that can be transmitted between humans and are stable in the human body, they become less active or less resistant.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the urine of a 60-year-old patient with severe lung and kidney disease in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases originated in the Middle East, the virus was spread by other people through occasional contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another small-scale event took place in South Korea in 2015, with 186 participants.
MERS symptoms are similar to those of SARS, and are common in severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS cases also developed severe renal failure, which is not the same as MERS among other HCoV infections.
More than 30 patients had symptoms of intestinal infection, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there were more than 2,500 confirmed cases and 34.4% deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses.
In late December 2019, a case of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory illness was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory illness a public health emergency of global concern and designated it COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Interestingly, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, compared to 1.2% outside the province.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; it is characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also had diarrhea.
Lung disease is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become a severe respiratory illness.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a high degree of similarity in the 82% nucleotide sequence, they are divided into several subtypes and disease groups.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less aggressive but more transmissible in humans than it is in the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in asymptomatic individuals and may have contributed to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals significant similarities and differences.
First, the pre- and post-exposure period are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 has substantial similarities to six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is shared between SARS-CoV and four other HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
In some cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection produces symptoms that are common in human HCoV infections, including unrecognized, mild, or no symptoms at all.
In some cases, a small number of severe COVID-19 cases may also be associated with SARS-CoV infection, although the number is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows similar traits to HCoVs in humans and SARS-CoV.
In addition, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than that of HCoVs in humans.
In addition, it is necessary to assess whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is decreasing after human exposure as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a fecal-borne disease, it is important to note that further research is needed to fully describe it in the future.
It is of particular interest to know whether SARS-CoV-2 can be seasonal as is the case with HCoVs in humans.
However, the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 and its transmission, expression and spread patterns after exposure to humans will influence the spread of COVID-19.
All HCoVs present in humans exhibit mild symptoms that are adapted to the human body.
In addition, it may also be true that females are more susceptible to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be a target for the HCoV pandemic in the past and survive.
HCoVs that have caused severe human disease and those that have been infected with severe HCoV infection have been eliminated.
To do so, HCoVs must be produced in a healthy human population so that new ones can emerge to overcome environmental barriers.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 lives and the more people infected, the greater the chance of its adaptation to humans.
If it is well tolerated, people are less likely to catch transmission through quarantine or other means of transmission.
Over the years, four human-infected CoVs have been circulating in humans, causing the common cold to weaken the immune system.
These viruses do not need to be contained in animals.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV are not adapted to humans and have different mechanisms to prevent human transmission.
It would have to remain and spread only among animals and seek to spread to humans, usually through one or more safe carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar symptoms to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four other human HCoVs.
It is as transmissible as HCoVs that infect humans, at least for now.
However, it is more virulent than human HCoVs but less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt to humans and move among them without a transporter or a pack animal.
Before discussing the origins of HCoVs, it is useful to discuss their characteristics and developmental processes, genetics, habitat, migration patterns and the factors that make them HCoVs.
The animal is the site of HCoV growth by occupying a nucleotide-linked particle.
The virus parasite is highly adaptive and does not transmit disease to the host.
Similarly, a carrier of HCoVs is known to retain it for long periods of time.
In both cases, the host cells are found to be susceptible to infection and the appropriate host site for HCoV or the virus that causes it.
However, when the HCoVs are introduced into a safe environment before or near the human body, they do not adapt well to the new environment and are often pathogenic.
This secondary habitat may be an animal pathogen and plays a key role in its reinforcement by allowing the virus to replicate and then enter the human body and accelerate its infection rate.
HCoVs can cause lethal infection if they cannot be contained in a secondary host.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to secondary habitats and even survive in their environment.
In this case, the second habitat becomes its most suitable habitat.
Outbreak reports suggested that SARS patients have a long history of contact with toys.
The study of the disease-causing effects of the virus showed that people who trade in animals have a higher resistance to SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
The masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and a vivverin dog at the pet markets were the first to be identified as carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV.
This was supported by the fact that new SARS cases were detected after the destruction of all civet populations in the markets.
However, it has been suggested that the masked palm civets that were collected from wild or agricultural areas without being introduced into the wildlife markets were not SARS-CoV, suggesting that these civets may be secondary hosts of SARS-CoV but not primary hosts.
Interestingly, since 80% of animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies against SARS-CoV, it is also possible that some insects are secondary hosts of SARS-CoV viruses.
These are all endpoints for SARS-CoV.
A detailed study in animals that carry SARS-CoV found a close affinity for the SARS Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) CoV, which is found in the horse-toothed bat in China.
The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome in bats.
This bat and the CoVs bat have 88-92% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV.
This research has helped to develop a new theory that bats are responsible for transmitting disease to humans.
Many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified as originating in bats, but only WIV1 of all can be considered a live virus.
It is known that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary vector for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from bat feces was used to demonstrate the use of ACE2 in bats, civets and humans as a receptor for the invading cells.
Importantly, the serum of SARS survivors was able to kill WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest relative of SARS-CoV in bats, as it is 95% nucleotide-identical.
Although there is a strong correlation between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that WIV1 is not the secondary host of SARS-CoV and that the spores are not the host of SARS-CoV.
The study of the association of MERS-CoVs in a single bat group with CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 bats.
Both CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a specific inhibitor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to infect the virus.
MERS-CoV is a subtype of the related mouse beta-CoVs that has been identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been detected in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat-like CoV-HKU25, share 87% of the same nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats cannot be the primary hosts of MERS-CoV.
However, studies in the Middle East have shown that camel camels carry MERS-CoV, which kills the immune system, as do camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
MERS-CoVs with a similar life-cycle to the virus found in humans were isolated from the noses of camels, suggesting that camel urine is the MERS-CoV's home environment.
It is also important because mild but significant signs of viral transmission have often been observed in camels tested for MERS-CoV.
Importantly, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also from the feces to the mouth, which is also the route the virus travels from bats to us.
However, the only questions remain because many MERS patients had no contact with camels before the outbreak, either from a human source or from unknown MERS-CoV-positive animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide similarity to the bat CoV RaTG13 obtained from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV examples, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so strong that it is not possible to say which strains are the same.
This means that bats cannot develop a secondary or primary host for SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar bat-like CoVs is identified in the future.
It is likely that the secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 is a wildlife species that is commercially and commercially harvested in Huanan, where most of the COVID-19 viruses are thought to have originated, suggesting that it may have been transmitted from humans to animals.
A number of metagenome studies suggest that a group of endangered species called pangolins (Manis javanica) may be ancestors of beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of the novel CoV pangolin shares 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are very similar to RaTG13 in that they are 90% identical at the nucleotide level.
The combination of two sub-classes of plant-derived SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which have a similar RBD to SARS-CoV-2, accounts for 97.4% of its amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although they share a strong similarity at the genome level.
A previous study on dead pangolins found that they contained a lung virus, which was similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study uses alternative methods to combine treatment to produce a genome that is 86.3% of the total length of the viral genome.
It is not excluded that pangolins may be one of the secondary hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there have long been suggestions that SARS-CoV-2 is actually derived from pangolins due to differences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 that are similar to beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much smaller than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 derived from bangolin beta-CoVs.
The transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and certain animals is not yet known.
Although there is a close relationship between RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share a large number of similar genomes.
It is generally assumed that the strongest similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs is due to the highly differentiated evolutionary pattern.
The hypothesis is that the association between a single pangolin SARS-CoV-2 and a beta-CoV with RaTG13 in the fourth generation of wildlife is uncertain.
The most common evolutionary process, recombination, is common in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on which animal is the source of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the pathogenicity of HCoVs, the women also studied the animal-derived origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
The phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses may have originated from rodents.
Reports indicate that the Appalachian Ridge CoV (ARCoV.2) was detected in North America, and the tricolor was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is similar to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, but its secondary habitat was reported to be camelids.
For convenience, the recent knowledge that HCoVs are of animal origin is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence that HCoVs have historically evolved from one species to another.
When HCoV-OC43 was transferred from one organism to another from cattle to humans in the 1890s, it was thought to have caused a respiratory illness.
The evolution of HCoV-229E from one species to another is unclear.
The female bat alpha-CoVs were found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
The alpaca alpha-CoV is one of them.
There is considerable evidence that the virus originated in bats and was transmitted directly to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, came into contact with bats in their natural habitat.
Nevertheless, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E- derived from bats, alpha-CoVs are distinct and do not cause disease in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not detectable in animal feces.
Therefore, it cannot be immediately ruled out that alpacas have been infected with human HCoV-229E alpha-CoV.
Indeed, bats are responsible for many of the viruses that cause disease in humans, including the rat virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that HCoV-229E may have been transmitted directly from bats to humans.
Alternatively, although alpha-CoVs are the same bat that donated their blood to CoV-229E, alpacas and camels may be secondary hosts that transmit the virus to humans, as was the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of how the virus originated from bats and spread to camels and from camels to humans.
The transmission of MERS-CoV from bats is known as early detection and subsequent evidence supports the hypothesis.
Bats are known to carry a large number of viruses that are distributed among many species and that are transmitted from one species to another.
Breathing, group sitting, close contact and strong flight are all important for bats to be a "virus transmitter".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been known to infect camels for a long time.
It is so accustomed to these camels that it is no longer a second home but a comfortable and comfortable one.
MERS-CoV is a mild and highly contagious virus that is transmitted by these animals.
Human transmission is a risk and the human population will continue to be affected by the spread of MERS-CoV.
In contrast to the role of camels in the spread of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is distinct.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are responsible for a number of pathogens in pangolins.
They are a lethal site for SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs, as are civets for SARS-CoV.
There is a high probability that SARS-CoV-2 will be transmitted from one organism to another, from animals to humans, but future studies will be needed to confirm this.
First, bats may be the host of SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share a habitat with bats by killing them or by mining coal.
First, pangolins may be one of the secondary safe areas for SARS-CoV-2 to enter in the near future.
Humans are infected by killing animals and eating animal flesh.
It is possible that mammals and even domestic animals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Research on domestic and wild animals to produce antibodies is highly promising.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 probably occurred in a third organism that interacted with bats and pangolins.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is being investigated.
In addition to these potential host species, three key features of the virus that are also important for the treatment of CoVs are its potential to infect other organisms.
First, it is highly reactive with RNA and reproduces.
Unlike other RNA viruses, the rate of transmission of CoVs can be classified as positive and severe and varies from ~10-4 per year in 2 regions, depending on how the CoV species adapts to its new environment.
CoVs have a specific exoribonuclease class, killing them can cause them to multiply too much and slow down their activity or even prevent them from growing.
Remdesivir is also known to inhibit the growth of CoVs by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-derived RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in humans.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is almost one million times higher than the population density.
Additionally, the mutation rate was often higher if CoVs did not adapt to their new environment.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have a lower mutation rate, suggesting a higher homology.
In a sense, it has adapted to a new environment that is closer to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also affects MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to camel-dwelling camels.
In theory, this is because mutations in the genotype will lead to the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs that make SARS-CoV-2 less potent.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoVs has some influence on mutation and repair, thus increasing their ability to grow, and is ideal for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions improve.
This is based on the fact that the opening of its cells and the activity of the protein produce 3 end of the genome.
Third, CoVs mutate spontaneously and frequently when they modify RNA through a complex copy-selection mechanism.
The environment and the binding site are often altered during the transcription of CoV RNA.
RNAs of similar length and small genomes can combine to produce new CoVs.
The presence of the virus in the human body is also associated with the development of the disease.
The virus's proximity to the virus' habitat in terms of transmission
In addition to the three viral characteristics mentioned above, the environment is another important factor in the transmission of viruses.
In this context, the interaction of SARS-CoV is described as a model, and suggests that it transmits disease by being transmitted from one organism to another.
Based on differential analysis of human and animal civet SARS-CoVs, it is likely that SARS-CoV will continue to mutate rapidly in its environment, particularly as it moves through the RBD of the S-protein.
CoV S-protein RBD is usually associated with host cells and is highly selective against host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318 to 510 amino acid S1 domain, which binds to human ACE2 and other viral domains.
SARS-CoV RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in several animals, including bats, civets, rats and wolves, allowing the virus to move from one organism to another.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be unique in humans and the civet virus developed by RBD and 4 of these receptor-containing residues are associated with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civet has mutations in its RBD of K479N and S487T genes, which increase the affinity between the spike protein and ACE2 of the host.
In other words, two amino acid substituents may be essential for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same host-specificity as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein suggests that the relationship of its S protein to human ACE2 may be altered.
In fact, one cryo-EM study found a 10- to 20-fold higher correlation between this association than between human ACE2 and S-protein SARS-CoV.
It will also be important to determine whether further action is required to spread SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but in a different S-type.
There are several other receptors for HCoV, including aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-sialic acid acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
It may also help in the adaptation of CoVs to humans after they have moved from animal to human habitat.
In addition to host cells, the effect of HCoVs on the transmission of HCoVs from one organism to another is determined by their interactions with other hosts and their inhibitory factors.
The protein variation of the environment and the environment of hosts of HCoVs such as bats, camels and rodents may be a factor in preventing transmission from one species to another.
HCoVs must replace their host and modify their host-specific pathogenicity to allow them to move from one species to another.
In this case, the molecular basis for the key link between the virus and the environment is still unknown and will require further research.
Effective detection of genome dependence and inhibitory factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the CRISPR-based robustness assay may be helpful.
New HCoVs: Back to basics
The variation of bat CoVs provides a significant basis for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In general, bat CoVs are the source of HCoVs.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and gene duplication also contribute to the growth of HCoVs and are two key steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or deletion of protein gene coding has the potential to significantly alter the interaction between viruses.
Among the SARS-CoV protein sequences, ORF8 appears to be important for adaptation to humans, as the SARS-CoV bat viruses were isolated but were found to be a secreted variant of ORF8 proteins.
They found that they killed 29-nucleotide SARS-CoVs that are marginally associated with early human infection.
This killing separates ORF8 from ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mechanism that allows it to migrate from one location to another.
In addition, SARS-CoV may also be associated with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where many small RNA-derived RNA polymerase bindings have been observed.
The binding sites were also found in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV virus appears to have been isolated from multiple lines, which originated in Saudi Arabian camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, interactions have been observed with other HCoVs, including HCoVs that have been genetically associated with other animal CoVs.
Care should also be taken that false selection can lead to unintended mutations in the viral genomes, and may weaken the viruses against their own influences, such as the host's immune system.
One example of this is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype, which is caused by the killing of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 can be found in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca showed a single nucleotide increase, resulting in a reversal of the pattern.
Last but not least, the growth of new HCoVs is influenced by their habitats.
No or minimal symptoms were observed when bats were infected with CoVs, suggesting a genetic link between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to be very familiar with CoVs in anatomical and physiological terms.
For example, defects in the accurate secretion of mucus in bats have reduced the risk of infection from CoVs.
In addition, the killer cells died because of the increased NKG2/CD94 specificity and showed low levels of histocompatibility with complex class I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the active metabolism of bats can kill or replicate CoVs and affect their expression by exoribonuclease, thus helping to identify pathogenic viruses that are more likely to be found in new environments.
Many CoV infections can also develop through interaction, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or proteins adapted to the environment.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in their host species such as bats and camels.
It is usually produced without the use of a host's immune system.
This is where the symptoms of the disease are detected and where the symptoms are most acute.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by hyperactivity of the immune system and increased cytokines in the immune system's response, which can cause severe lung damage.
In contrast, in patients with no symptoms, the innate immune system of the CoV is twice as active.
A similar method of removing the antibodies may have a positive effect on SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon is especially effective in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is expected to be highly effective.
Furthermore, stimulation of NLRP3 by inflammasomes in bats is not effective.
Based on these hypotheses, the induction of NLRP3 into the inflammasome with MCC950 may contribute to the development of a cure for COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak follows a pattern of events that causes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to emerge.
Although bat beta-CoVs appear to have 95% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV, bat-CoVs have 96% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same viruses as SARS-CoV, the new SARS-CoV-2 migration patterns are similar.
The presence of pangolin beta-CoVs is highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be a host of these viruses or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the differentiation of the final SARS-CoV-2 genes.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that human-made SARS-CoV-2 is deliberate or malicious.
CoVs have been the subject of renewed attention in recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our view of whether HCoVs originate from animals and their hosts before being transmitted to humans.
The presence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the human microbiome is not confirmed.
Because SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-civet contact in markets, closing raw animal markets and killing existing civets may be a potential endpoint for SARS infection.
In the same vein, pangolins should be removed from raw animal markets to prevent animal transmission, as evidence suggests that many pangolin-derived beta-CoVs are related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future studies will help determine whether SARS-CoV-2 has been transmitted to humans from pangolins and other animals.
In some cases, MERS-CoV has been infecting camels for a long time.
Camels play a key role in transmitting the disease to humans, as do meat, milk, skins, and wool products to local populations.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to kill all camels to combat MERS, as was done at the wildlife markets in Chinae to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent further outbreaks of MERS, we need to develop more effective research into the development of effective vaccines for MERS-CoV in camels, and to implement additional control measures to combat the disease.
Without the ability to eradicate these viruses, new genomes can lead to new diseases.
Many CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, animal CoVs can present in a wide variety of forms.
There is a high probability that these animal CoVs will replicate and replicate, resulting in new CoVs that will become more transmissible and/or lethal in the future.
The practice of eating wild fish in parts of China should be curtailed to reduce human contact with wildlife.
As SARS, MERS and COVID-19 have plagued us, we need to prepare and plan for their impact.
Indeed, many viruses have been present on our planet for millennia.
They remain in their places until they have a chance to emerge.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of these viruses, we can reduce the risk of contact with bats and other wildlife by educating people to stay away from these animals.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is important to understand the nature and habitat of CoVs, and will help prevent animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
Finally, the best way to prevent animal-borne viruses is to keep people away from the areas where the animals that carry the viruses live.
The presence of the virus in the human body is not known.
First, if bats have transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be useful to understand how bats and pangolins coexist.
Second, if the virus was transmitted directly from bats to humans, we need to know how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the tertiary mammals are the secondary true habitat of the virus, it is necessary to explain how it interacts with other organisms including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals and even pets may be carriers of SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and testing for the disease should be undertaken.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or other similar viruses will be identified in their habitats in the future.
Continued monitoring of these events may help to understand how SARS-CoV-2 develops in animals, and this has implications for the control and prevention of COVID-19 in humans.
Awareness-raising cases of concern are COVID-19 cases in confirmed cases are important
On 6 February 2020, our organization published a recommendation for a vaccine for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (2019-nCoV), providing our current knowledge and expertise to combat the global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still present, and our knowledge and understanding of it is increasingly based on existing data and clinical data; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment from our support and provided the immediate diagnostic criteria for reminder cases and approved cases in the latest Diagnostic and Supporting Document for COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was subsequently named acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO defined COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our organization has expanded the support of the precautionary advisory and this was published online in the Army Medical Review of 06 February 2020.
It has been a source of fascination to many readers since its publication.
However, given the prevalence of COVID-19, our knowledge and understanding of the disease is increasing with the availability of existing diagnostic and treatment tools; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.
The Diagnostic Assistance Model for COVID-19 was published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, and has produced seven editions, with some contexts undergoing significant changes.
Now that our help has received a comment from Zhou et al., they have introduced a simple way to score on their clinical experience tracking.
Their work has increased the local response to the pandemic and has been a key driver of global response.
We welcome their important work and thank them.
However, their work also requires updates on the current diagnostic and diagnostic support for COVID-19 (Test version 7) studies.
In the following seventh edition (3 March 2020), the selection of the case studies requires the combination of one part of the epidemiological data report with two parts of the clinical manifestations to produce a complete analysis, or requires the completion of three parts of the clinical manifestations in the absence of epidemiological data:
Epidemiological data: (1) data from travel or residence in and around Wuhan, or other concentrations of COVID-19 cases reported 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) data from contact with a SARS-CoV-2 case (positive nucleic acid nucleotide test); (3) data from contact with a fever or respiratory symptoms patient from Wuhan, or from nearby or other concentrations where COVID-19 cases were reported in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) data from contact with a group of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases per fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, school, school, office, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal, decreased, or decreased white blood cell counts at the onset of the disease.
A valid case diagnosis should include a case reference with at least one of the following characteristics or serological evidence: (1) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in real time; (2) a genome-wide sequence showing increased homogeneity for the identified coronaviruses; (3) a positive test for IgM specific antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum; or a change in IgM of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or a rise in titer ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase of the case.
Note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
Blood sample sequencing was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); and serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes in the detection of memory followed a process that led to the development of diagnostic tools for the optimal detection of nucleic acids, including a respiratory tract sample and a blood sample, resulting in a wide range of assumptions, and facilitated the delivery of positive specific antibody results to the critical assay.
Furthermore, the evidence is a reminder that we should monitor atypical asymptomatic patients.
For follow-up, the chart of Zhou et al. should be kept up to date, as the clinically asymptomatic person was replaced by a low-risk person.
The scoring system should also be verified by additional clinical tools and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that the permanent evidence will be added and invite readers to share their observations.
For diagnosis of cases is recommended and recommended that we seek and follow the advice of local authorities.
Our team will also provide timely updates on our support to help with relief efforts.
Bangladesh reports three more COVID-19 deaths than in any other day
Yesterday, Bangladesh reported five deaths from COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest death rate from the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a total of 114 cases and 33 home-bound recoveries.
17 people died.
In a statement on social media, IEDCR Director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the dead were two men and two women.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two are in their 60s, two are in their 51s, and one is in his 41s.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 January.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, the state news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the head of the Anti-Robbery Commission, who was at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video message posted online, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport Obaidul Quader said that buses would be closed for several days, including next Saturday.
The bus closures began on March 26 and were scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Carrying essential items  medicines, fuel and food  may be permitted.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on 8 March, involving two Italian migrants and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three men were rescued.
SARS-Cov-2 has exceeded one million infections worldwide
As of Thursday, the number of new cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease had exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins records.
52 deaths were from COVID-19, a coronavirus-related illness.
The winner came on the day that Malawi and Zambia had their first coronavirus case.
North Korea reported on Thursday that it was the first country in the world to have no confirmed cases of coronavirus.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 active cases and 79,332 cases as of 1 to 10 a.m. European Time (0800UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 5,900 deaths.
According to CBS News, after Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus death toll was 1,000 on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have imposed strict restrictions to stop the spread of the virus.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the curfew until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians would continue to receive salaries even if they did not go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the 15-day lockdown, with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
In Saudi Arabia, the curfew was extended to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for one day; previously, the curfew was only for 3 pm and 6 am.
Thailand was placed under curfew at 10 pm and 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the city would impose a stay-at-home order effective May 1.
Stores in Australia have cut the price of paper towels that one can buy
On Sunday and Saturday, Australian supermarket chain Woolworths and Coles imposed a one-to-two purchase policy for paper towels in all stores across the country.
ALDI also introduced a single rule for man, the first day.
The rules were posted on the outside of the shop and on their Facebook page.
People were buying in bulk because of the risk of COVID-19 confinement.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also introduced a cap on home delivery services with a cap on how much paper goods can be bought.
The following orders were delivered on Thursday only at Woolworths in Coles on 4 and 5 March.
Coles, in a press release dated 8 March, said that the four-person rule had come into effect, that some supplies were running out within an hour of the supply arriving and called the demand for supplies excess, while ALDI, on Facebook on Tuesday called it excess.
Sales have been up sharply in the past week, says a Woolworths representative.
Costo's shop in Canberra also closed with two fatalities last week.
To satisfy the shortage concerns, Coles ordered more supplies, Woolwoths ordered more, and AlDI ordered Wednesday supplies that arrived several days early.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are increasing sales, but they are deeply concerned about the regulations.
It is well known that the production capacity must be increased to meet human needs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the earlier launch, some stores would not have Wednesday's Special.
In a news.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a marketing expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores are bringing in more people.
He felt that paper was too big, so it was too small, and it was too fast, filling up the shop floor, which added to the fear of running out.
Coles and Woolworths are right (that) if there were more products in the stores, if products like paper towels and hand sanitizer could be (purchased) in bulk, the price would explode and fall says Russell Zimmerman on ABC News.
The maker of Papiergenik Who Gives a Crap said they were out of supplies Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, manufacturer of Kleenex paper, and Solaris paper manufacturer Sorbent, said they were available 24/7 to meet demand, according to news.com.au reports.
Domain.com, real estate agents reported that some landlords were offering free first-time buyers' home servicing, when people were less likely to buy because they had nothing to do on Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's NT News, Darwin's reading list, featured eight paper clippings to help with papergenics.
Before the retailers were forced to impose restrictions, ABC Australia reported on March 3 that they were not willing to limit the number of items people bought.
Russell Zimmerman noted that there is also a growing demand for other items, such as masks, hygiene products, dry food, hand sanitizers, and flour.
And, outside Australia, on Sunday, a shop in Ocado in the UK found that people were buying less of Andre's papergenics than a 12-pack of two.
COVID-19 declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak  The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus  a pandemic.
Although the name pandemic is based on the nature of the disease, not its severity, WHO recognized the need for governments to act:
All countries can end the pandemic.
When countries detect, test, respond, quarantine and monitor and mobilize for action, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
We are concerned about how it is spreading and how nothing is happening.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the United States, the pandemic is "a miracle".
He said that, as CNN reported in February, since the outbreak of influenza, no other respiratory illness has been linked to a serious or widespread outbreak worldwide.
Ghebreyesus made a similar comment, saying We have seen a pandemic that is not related to coronavirus.
He added, And who hasn't seen a pandemic that can be stopped.
The name pandemic comes from the WHO's decision in January to declare it a global health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the American Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said "Then things could get worse".
On Thursday, the United Nations reported that of the 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, 4,600 had died.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus respiratory disease type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
364,000 people were evacuated.
The mortality rate is 4% in China, the world average is 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications include pneumonia, difficulty breathing.
If the disease is present, it will take five to 12 days for symptoms to develop.
There is no known vaccine or cure.
They will first help with symptoms and help you recover. To prevent infection, you should wash your hands, cover your nose or mouth when coughing, stay away from people, and be aware of people who are in quarantine because they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Governments around the world have enacted road closures, lockdowns, curfews, workplace safety measures, and lockdowns.
The pandemic has caused global economic hardship, disrupted sports, churches, politics and entertainment, and widened global supply chaos due to overconsumption.
Schools and universities have closed across the country or in cities in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the population.
A lack of awareness about the virus is widespread online, and xenophobia is particularly evident among ethnic Chinese, East and Southeast Asian and nearby populations, and those in the affected areas.
After the road closures, the carbon footprint of the atmosphere decreases.
Officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) detected a high incidence of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and a clinical trial was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases came from a Huanan pet market and the virus is believed to have originated there and is zoonotic.
The virus that causes the disease is SARS-CoV-2, a novel strain of the bat coronavirus, the human papillomavirus and SARS-CoV.The first case of symptomatic disease was reported on 1 December 2019, and the case was not known to have originated in the region.
Of the cases in 2019, more than half were reported from the market.
On 13 March 2020, a report from South China Morning Post reported that the outbreak began on 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old man in Hubei.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that cases had decreased in China but started to rise in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of cases exceeding the number in China.
It may mean that we do not know how many people are infected among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, the number of new cases was relatively low, with the proportion of 19-year-olds under 2.4 per cent in the country.The head of the UK's Science Study, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the population in Britain would need to be infected before the immune system could respond.
Cases are the number of people with COVID-19 that have tested positive, according to the regulations.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have imposed restrictions on testing for people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study conducted between March 16 and February 23 in China found that 86% of COVID-19 cases were unidentified, and they were responsible for spreading the disease in 79% of known cases.
A report released on 30 March found that the number of cases in Italy was higher than previously reported.
The prevalence of (R0) COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that it could be 5.7.
Most cases of COVID-19 are cured.
For those who did not recover, the average time between symptoms and death was 6 to 41 days, with a median of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, 97,000 people have died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of the deaths were in people aged 60 years or older, and 75% had other medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.Covid-19 deaths are those who tested positive for COVID as required by law.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be higher, but it does not include untested cases  such as, at home, in nursing homes, and more.
A partial study from Italy found that the number of COVID-19 deaths was 4-5 times higher than previously estimated.
A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official found that Or knew that (local death rates) were incorrect because they were too low, according to U.S. data researchers. Such low rates are common in outbreaks, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine fever pandemic.The latest death in Wuhan was on 9 January 2020.
The latest death in China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the latest death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, forty countries had reported cases of the disease on all continents except Antarctica.
These rates vary widely, and depend on the type of testing, the type of hospital, the treatment, when the outbreak began, and other population factors such as age, gender, and health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate among new cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number depends on the location.
In China, the overall mortality rate is 17.3% (of those with symptoms on 1-10 January 2020) and 0.7% (of those with symptoms on 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of cases with illness and death, and the case fatality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of cases with illness (as measured by the test) and deaths from illness.
These statistics are not hourly, depending on the current state of the world and population.
Several academics have attempted to identify these limers for large populations.
The Centre for the Study of Medicine at Oxford University estimates the mortality rate of the disease to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above figure is one of the German COVID-19 statistics, and the statistical study will include CFR tests.
The WHO says the pandemic is manageable.
The timing of the pandemic is uncertain and varies from region to region
Maciej Boni of Penn State University says, If not properly understood, the disease can be reduced if its hiding places are removed.
But there's no way to know these days how it's going to be.
The Chinese government's student government in Zhong Nanshan said that  could be completed by June if all countries follow WHO guidelines on how to control the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine predicted that SARS-CoV-2 would be circulating for one to two years.
Based on a study by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, social distancing and other appropriate measures are recommended for the vaccination period (which may take 18 years or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University says, "I don't know if it's a coronavirus because it will be forgotten quickly, it will go away forever, and it can become a disease that comes and goes, it can come back at any age".
The time it takes to recover depends on how strong the immune system is and when it is strengthened.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be complex and may not be recognized by those who are infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Minor symptoms include physical weakness, respiratory disease, hearing loss, broken shoulder, arthritis, motor, headache, chills, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO estimates that one in six people will experience severe illness and respiratory distress.
In the U.S. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists serious symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain or heaviness, loss of consciousness, difficulty walking, dizziness; urgent medical attention is required if these symptoms are present. In addition, illness can lead to pneumonia, respiratory infection, sepsis and death.
Some patients may have no symptoms, with no symptoms but with diagnostic tests, so the researchers suggest that those who were close to the tested patients should be better understood.
China reports that the number of people without symptoms is as high as 44%.
The time to recovery (infection and onset of symptoms) is 1 to 14 days; the maximum is 5 days. Due to the lack of awareness, the proportion of COVID-19 patients with severe hearing loss has decreased from 30% to 15%.
The nature of the disease's spread is well-known.
Malaria is believed to be spread by close contact with humans and by small droplets of urine produced by coughing, itching, or talking; the closest contact is 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that cough syrups can travel 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers suggest that the virus can also be spread by long-duration respiratory fluids, which are produced during speech, breathing, and walking, where the virus is not in the air.
Water droplets can be inhaled by nearby people, and they can be inhaled.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by intubation can increase the flow of airways into the body.
It can also be spread by touching the skin, eyes, nose and mouth.
Some say it can walk in a tube, but this one is only slightly fearful.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in feces.The virus is most active in the first three days after onset of symptoms, but can be transmitted in the absence of symptoms and in the final days of the virus.
People are diagnosed three days after infection, which means that the infection can be spread by someone who does not have symptoms.
Only a few laboratory studies have reported asymptomatic cases but symptomatic cases have been reported in other countries following close contacts with the infected.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECD) states that it is not known how the virus is transmitted in a random manner, with one person spreading to two or three people.
For example, the virus was detected on plastic (polypropylene) for three days and on 304 steel for one day on carton, and four days on copper.
However, this depends on the temperature of the environment.Cats and other animals may be exposed to COVID-19.
No studies have shown that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but authorities in the UK have recently recommended that people wash their hands after touching animals, especially after touching infected people's skin.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new outbreak, with the first case isolated from people with pneumonia or respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2s are produced in the environment. Outside the human body, the virus can live on the surface of soap and then become infected and die. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the SARS-CoV family.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has identified coronaviruses in Betacoronaviruses, in the Sarbecovirus (strain B) regions, in combination with two from bats.
It is 96% identical to the genome of this bat-derived coronavirus (batCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, a Chinese study found that the only amino acid differences between the two were in certain regions of the genome of the human and the parent virus.
The entire genome is found in 92% of human ancestral coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 cases, which does not suggest that the disease is caused by ancestral causes.
Post-viral infection can be detected in the symptoms, but diagnosis for this diagnosis should be made by rRT-PCR analysis of the infected areas on a CT scan.
Studies to determine the differences between PCR and CT in Wuhan suggest that CT is more visual than PCR, but it is not as specific, as more images are seen in pneumonia and other infections.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology stated that CT is not recommended for new COVID-19 patients.
The WHO published a number of RNA test manuscripts for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 March.
The test has been shown to detect the presence of rRT-PCR polymerase.
The test may be performed with urine or blood.
Results will be announced in the next few hours or days.
However, tests are made of nasal and oral fluids.Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these had been proven to be valid for mass use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex is approved for emergency treatment only for laboratory use.
Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of asymptomatic subjects are opaque and high blood clotting has not been observed.
The Italian Radio Society is developing a website to showcase images of the patients.
Because it is associated with many diseases such as adenovirus, the shadow of PCR blindness is too small to detect COVID-19.
A large study in China of chest CT and PCR imaging suggests that the images are slow, fast and poorly understood, suggesting that they have helped in the fight against the pandemic.
Artificial sensing techniques to detect the presence of the virus in the nervous system by radiographs or CT scans.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include proper hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or itching through clothing and quickly discarding it.
Those who may be infected should wear masks outside the home.
Social distancing is also important.Many governments have restricted or restricted nonessential travel in areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has become a global epidemic.
This means that the virus is spreading among people in the community, some of whom do not know how or where they got sick. Physicians who treat patients should advise on social distancing and monitoring. Monitoring of the community is essential for authorities to identify the source of the disease in order to stop it.
The government's help in tracking phone numbers has been criticized by Amnesty International and 100 other organizations for their surveillance.
Many mobile applications have been developed to assist, as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen students were working in the field of data security, including enabling Bluetooth to detect proximity to other mobile devices.
People will then receive a message that they were in close contact with someone who has COVID-19.The information on how to prevent infection, such as rinsing the nose and rinsing the mouth with a mouthwash, is not entirely accurate.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organizations are working to make it available.
Hand washing is required to prevent the spread of disease to humans.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, after using the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating food; and after coughing, sneezing, and itching.
This is because outside the human body, the virus can be spread by household soap, which will disrupt its hiding place.
The CDC also recommends that handwashing with a detergent that is 60% less acidic than water and soap is less effective.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The areas may contain pathogens and solvents (especially in the case of one minute of exposure to iron disinfection), and 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2%-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chroxedine gluconate, are less potent.
The CDC recommends that any COVID-positive individuals who are hospitalized or suspected of having COVID, including workplaces, childcare facilities, public areas such as showers, living areas, distribution electronics, screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs that are handled by a patient, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a handkerchief or cloth for coughing or itching, and dispose of them as soon as possible.
Hospital masks are required for patients with severe illness, as wearing a mask can prevent the passage of saliva when a person is talking, itching or coughing.
The WHO has guidelines for when masks should be worn.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, says wearing a mask can prevent people from touching their face, as this is a major cause of infection. Masks can also be worn by a person caring for a person who may be infected.
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as those who care for a COVID-19 patient, but also recognizes the need for people to avoid touching their faces.
Many communities have begun requiring people to wear masks outdoors.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of rubber masks.China recommends single-use masks for people who are not sick, especially if they are within 1 meter (3 ft) of other people.
Hong Kong requires people to wear medical masks when riding buses or in public places.
Health authorities in Thailand recommend that people wear face masks indoors and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have imposed curfews on people who do not wear a mask.
On March 16, Vietnam required people to wear masks when outdoors to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has mandated that everyone entering the market wear a face mask.
Israel has required people to wear masks when outdoors.
Taiwan, which has been producing tens of millions of masks per day since mid-March, required masks on all trains and buses since 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory for people to wear face masks while outdoors, and has also made it possible to produce face masks at home for those who cannot afford them.
Masks are widely produced in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia as well as Singapore.
Social distancing (or social distancing) prevents infections that can prevent the spread of disease and disrupt social cohesion.
Other measures include quarantine; road closures; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
People can help with social distancing by staying home, avoiding roads, avoiding public places, avoiding contact, and keeping social distancing.
Many governments are imposing social distancing in areas with high infection rates.
The US government has defined a community as 250 or fewer people (if COVID-19 is not present in their community) or 50, and then 10 people.
As of 22 March 2020, Germany has restricted social interactions between two or more people. Older people and those with other health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system are at high risk of developing severe illness, and the CDC recommends that they stay home in areas with high infection rates. In late March 2020, the WHO and other emergency departments issued a call for Distance and Staying Away, meaning that social distancing should be enforced but social media or social distancing should be avoided.
The phrase "social distancing" implies that people should communicate with others, be isolated, but that people should communicate if they can.Some governments have introduced sexual distancing during the pandemic.
It is illegal to have sexual intercourse with a person who is a housemate and who does not have the virus or symptoms.
Home quarantine is required for COVID-19 positive and suspected cases.
Health facilities have made it mandatory for effective quarantine.Many governments have imposed or mandated quarantine in areas with high infection rates.
Strict quarantine rules are in place for those at high risk.
Those who have been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient and travellers who have returned from areas or communities with high infection should remain in quarantine for 14 days.
How to prevent or slow down the spread of this disease.
Prevention is carried out at the beginning of the outbreak by monitoring and quarantining the population and taking other measures to slow the spread of the disease and administering vaccines to the population to reduce the disease burden.
When it becomes difficult to contain the spread of disease, the next priority becomes: slowing the spread of the virus within the community.
The final work on the loading can be done together.
Reduction requires more work to reverse Panama's decline to 1 in the population. Disease control is slowing the progression of the pandemic process, which is called pandemic mitigation.
This has reduced the risk of overcrowding in healthcare facilities and allowed time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-medical factors that may contribute to the spread of disease include hand washing, wearing masks, quarantine; community distancing policies such as closing schools and restricting public gatherings; community consent to these activities; and community sanitation.More stringent measures were adopted in China as the crisis escalated, with citywide quarantines and road closures.
Some countries have implemented restrictions to contain the virus.
South Korea has implemented extensive testing and quarantine measures, and has imposed restrictions on movement.
Singapore has provided financial support to those who have self-quarantined and has imposed sanctions on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased mask production and has launched a war on mass-mask manufacturers.What Britain and the United States have done (delay but stop the spread of the pandemic) has been very effective.
The final rules could help hospital staff reduce attendance rates by two thirds and reduce mortality and morbidity among hospital staff.
Vaccination may be appropriate but should only be continued if the virus is still present in the population (or even if a vaccine is available), as the spread will resume if the population does not continue to follow the vaccination protocols.
Long-term policies to end the pandemic would be costly to the region and the economy.
There is no cure for COVID-19, but there is a work to be done to use it, and to test existing treatments.
Taking a cough medicine from a pharmacy, drinking water, and getting enough sleep can help with symptoms.
If it is severe, oxygen therapy, a breathing tube, and respirators may help.
Steroid therapy can cause serious complications.
Most of the symptoms have been approved for treatment with antiviral drugs that are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also suggested that other local and home remedies could help to treat these SARS-CoV-19 symptoms.
The increase and decrease in hospital admissions due to the increasing demand for COVID-19 patients is a key factor in the fight, according to the WHO.
The ECDC and WHO European Office have developed guidelines for specialist hospitals to provide services in other healthcare settings, such as laboratory support for COVID-19 testing, limiting the need for additional patient care, isolating or quarantining COVID-19 patients, and improving patient care with leprosy isolation and bedside ventilation.
There are many stories about the origin of this first patient (called patient zero).
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased dramatically.
They were people who were on the streets of Huanan Market, which also sold live animals, and one source said the virus was derived from these animals; or, as others have suggested, from wild animals or zoonotic.Many people were infected with pneumonia on October 26 and were treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei City Hospital, Jianghan CDC in Wuhan reported on October 27.
On 30 December, the medical community at Wuhan City Hospital reported a new outbreak of the SARS-CoV-coronavirus.
Eight priests, including Li Wenliang, were arrested by the police for making false statements, Ai Fen was suspended by his superiors for causing the accident.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a statement on 31 October and notified the WHO.
Most cases of pneumonia were reported to healthcare professionals in Wuhan for diagnosis in early January.In the early days of the outbreak, the incidence rate was increasing rapidly from seven days to half a day.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other cities in China, helped by the New Year's celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a major transit hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in a single day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latest official figures show 6,174 cases of the disease as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the world's largest cases.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cases were cured.
200 towns and areas I had a patient.
During the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries imposed travel restrictions and road closures.
Individuals are placed under a national quarantine (known as home stay, stay-at-home, or lockdown) and restricted travel.As of 2 April, 300 million people, or 90% of the population, were in a similar quarantine in the United States, over 50 million people were in quarantine in the Philippines, over 59 million were in quarantine in South Africa, and 1.3 billion were in quarantine in India.
As of 26 March, 1.7 billion tons of global quarantine had been completed, pushing 2.6 billion people worldwide into quarantine in the last two days  almost the entire world population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported at a level 1 outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, with some estimates as early as 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian diagnosed several cases of pneumonia on December 26, and then his hospital reported the Jianghan-Wuhan CDC on December 27.
The first genetic tests of the affected patients on 27 December 2019 identified SARS-CoV-2.
The Wuhan City Health Commission issued a statement on 31 November.
The WHO also issued a statement on the same day.
During the protests, witches in Wuhan were prevented by the police from lying about the incident.
The National Health Commission of China has stated that the disease is not transmitted to humans  no indication of it.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a campaign that was described by Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the "largest lockdown in world history", a health campaign began on 23 January to restrict access to Wuhan, covering 15 cities in Hubei, for a population of 57 million.
Public transportation was prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Moon Festival (January 25) was over.
The authorities also began construction of the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
A second hospital was later established, the Leishenshan Hospital, to treat patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has also set up 14 sites in Wuhan, including stadiums and four sports facilities, as well as hospitals.On 26 January, the government began to monitor the spread of COVID-19, and provide toilets for those attending the Spring Festival.
Universities and colleges in the country were closed.
The municipalities in Hong Kong have enacted a number of laws, especially regarding university students.
Remote work originated in the cities of China.
Roadblocks were imposed in Hubei.
Buses were replaced, and museums in central China were closed.
Traffic controls were imposed in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) were restricted from going outdoors.After the outbreak in March, the Chinese government imposed strict restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading to other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all foreign visitors.On 23 March, China had only one case reported in the country in five days, from a person returning from Guangzhou to Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Premier Li Keqiang said that the outbreak of the disease from within the country was contained and that China was responding to the outbreak effectively.
On the same day, the Hubei provincial government closed the roads in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hubei announced on 26 March 2020 that it would issue ten new visas from 28 March onwards, without specifying a date for the end of the ban.
Visitors to China will need to apply for a visa at a Chinese Embassy or Consulate.
The Chinese government issued a state of emergency on 30 March, with limited funding for the company's shareholders.City officials declared a day of mourning at 10:00 on 4 April, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, but the central government ordered online reminders to respect social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 was first detected in South Korea on 20 January 2020 in China.
The health city reported a surge in cases on April 20, due to a gathering held at Daegu's Shincheonji Jesus Church.
People from Shincheonji who traveled to Daegu and Wuhan found themselves responsible for spreading the disease.
As of 22 February, 9,336 people in Eklesia, 1,261 or 13%, had symptoms.South Korea had the highest number of cases as of 23 February 2020.
By February 28, more than 2,000 cases had been reported in Korah, rising to 3,150 by February 29.
All South Korean LMP patients were quarantined after three LMP patients tested positive for the virus.
Air traffic controllers were also affected.South Korea launched its first and largest ever operation in the world to screen a population for the virus, quarantine those infected and track contacts.
The testing service required first-come, first-served testing of people with symptoms for foreign travelers who could report via mobile phone apps, public transportation and conducted viral testing and increased testing to 20,000 daily tests.
It was found that the South Korean programme had a good response to the outbreak even without quarantine of the cities.South Korean society was devastated by President Jae-in's comments on the incident.
Many Koreans signed up for his dismissal because they felt he was ill, or were not interested in what he said.
On 23 March, South Korea was declared to be on a four-week low because it was only one country.
On 29 March, it was announced that from 1 March all foreign visitors would be placed under quarantine for four weeks.
According to officials as of April 1, South Korea had received orders for test kits from 121 countries.
Iran identified cases of SRS-CoV-2 on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, two people died that day.
The government began an emergency response by closing concerts, sporting events, Sunday services, and closing universities and other educational institutions.
Iran has spent three trillion dollars to combat the virus.
Secretary Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that they would not be putting quarantine kits in the areas where the disease kits were, and would be the only ones to be put in quarantine.
The city's road repair work began in March, but the heavy traffic jams were just before the start of the Ersian Nowruz festival.
Shia shrines have received ten pilgrims as of 16 March 2020.Iran became the country with the highest number of cases after China in February.
Despite claims of covert action in Iran, ten countries reported their first case from Iran on 28 February, claiming the disease was more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government.
The Iranian parliament was suspended, as 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to release human rights activists and temporarily release other detainees.
It said the risk of the virus spreading is higher in prisons, which lack adequate health facilities.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reached a one-day death toll of 100, the highest in the country since the pandemic began.

Tests for respiratory illness associated with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 include viral detection and antibody-generated immunity.
The presence of the virus in the samples was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is intended to detect SARS-COV-2 RNA.
It is used to diagnose new or existing diseases.
Antibody detection (serology) can be performed for diagnostic and surveillance purposes.
Antibody testing measures the number of people who are infected, including those with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have no symptoms.
The actual mortality rate and overall immunity levels can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had accurate data on the spread of the virus among its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and there is considerable variation in how many countries have tested.
This difference may also have a significant impact on mortality rates, which are likely to be very low in many countries.
Using the rRT-PCR reaction, a transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be performed on respiratory samples obtained from a variety of sources, including a partial nasal swab or a cough sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests on coughs are usually only effective if the infection is within the first week.
The virus may then disappear from the throat but continue to replicate in the lungs.
For patients who have been tested in the second week, this may be done by draining fluid into the inner respiratory tract via a catheter or a urine tube.
One of the first PCR tests was launched at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction transcription (rRT-PCR) process, and resulted in the production of 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also launched a test kit on 23 January 2020.A South Korean company Kogenebioch launched a PC-based device, the SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirusi) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the E gene that contains all beta coronaviruses and the specific RdRp genes for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI was the first company to receive a full FDA approval to develop a PCR assay for SARS-COV-2.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for the novel coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) to all of its laboratories using International Reagent Resource.
In our three genetic tests with previous models, the test kits produced poor results, and the difficulty of testing at the CDC in Atlanta, resulted in testing at 100 samples per day in February 2020.
The use of two-time-testing was found to be ineffective on 28 February 2020, after which state and local laboratories were authorized to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the tests under emergency authorization.US laboratories began providing testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that the nationwide testing of COVID-19 using RT-PCR was now available.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has approved the launch of a nationwide COVID-19 screening program on March 9, 2020.
The final count was not released; sampling and testing should be done in accordance with CDC guidelines.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing kits were developed at the VECTOR Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On 11 February 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services approved the testing service.On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic was developing a new COVID-19 test machine.On 13 March 2020, the FDA approved Roch Diagnostics to conduct the tests, which were supposed to take 3.5 hours at most, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA approved testing of Abbott's m2000 system by Abbott Laboratories; the FDA has already approved the use of Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received US FDA approval for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has approved the use of tests that use isothermal nucleic acid as an alternative to PCR.
The foot does not require temperature adjustment, a method that can give results in patients with infection in less than five minutes and in patients without infection in less than 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 units in the United States and Abbott researchers are expected to conduct 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses specific antibodies in combination with novel coronavirus nuclecapsid (N-protein) proteins is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it will produce results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the usual flu test.
In March 2020, the journal reported that a chest X-ray is not very useful in the early stages, but CT [computed tomography] may be even before symptoms begin to appear.
CT scans include simple multilateral mirrors with peripheral, asymmetric and external connections.
The subpleural is large, strong, and resilient when the disease spreads.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak found that CT was more effective than PCR, but had less accurate results, and some of its images were more sensitive to pneumonia and other infections.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT be used only for diagnostic purposes or as a primary screening test for COVID-19. In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR as a first step.
To fight infection, we can produce antibodies including IgG and IgG.
It can be used to diagnose disease in humans 7 days or more after onset of symptoms, to measure immunity, and to monitor populations.Testing can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or in a point-of-care (PocT) setting.
More sophisticated automated systems in many hospital laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their effectiveness will depend on the number of people each system can handle.
CLT usually uses a small sample of blood, although multiple samples may be used to measure immune function.
For PoCT, a blood sample from the skin is usually taken from the scrotum.
Unlike PCR, step-by-step methods are not required before starting.As of 26 March 2020, the FDA has identified 29 sites that are subject to adequate reporting and can now distribute their own antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency test.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval to begin using their test machines, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in virus-containing blood samples.
They are capable of performing multiple tests on samples at the same time and will be faster than conventional PCR for viral RNA testing.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the disease.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits it had purchased were safe.
Hong Kong is developing a home isolation system, whereby the emergency department will give patients a tube, spit it out, re-inject it, and then send it for testing.The British NHS has announced that it will develop a home isolation system to treat suspected cases, which will prevent the patient from infecting others if they come to the hospital or carry out an ambulance cleanup if they are used for a specific patient.In conducting COVID-19 tests on suspected cases, a doctor collects a sample with extreme caution.
The mobile testing centers have enabled South Korea to conduct tests at a faster and more comprehensive rate than anywhere else in the world.In Germany, the National Health Insurance Corporation reported on 2 March, it has the capacity to conduct nearly 12,000 tests per day in ambulances and treated 10,700 patients in the past week.
The medical insurance pays for the tests if the doctor requires them.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Academy, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests a week.
On 19 March, the testing facilities made it possible for most major cities to conduct tests.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of confirmed cases in Germany was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
The first laboratory survey conducted in the week of 12/2020 reported testing of approximately 483,295 samples and included a 12/2020 weekly review of 33,491 samples (6.9%) with SARS-COV-2 infection.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a novel methodology and tested 64 samples at once, with the addition of samples and only testing of multiple infected samples.In Wuham, a 2000-square-meter emergency laboratory named Huo-Yan (Chinese: 火眼 , or 人眼 in English) was launched on 5 February 2020 at the BGI, which can test 10,000 samples per day.
In a counting project led by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasting 5 days, Hubei's production would have been 47% higher and equivalent to the cost of quarantine that would have doubled if the testing project had not been launched.
Huo-Yan in Shenzehen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, followed the Wuhan laboratory quickly, with a total of 12 Chinese cities following suit.
As of 4 March 2020, the daily test capacity was 50,000.One of the newest, multiplex models developed by Origami Assays, can test 1,122 COVID-19 patient samples using only 93 assays.More efficient models can be used in small laboratories without the help of robots.
In March, the shortage of vaccines for mass testing became a major concern in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to develop techniques to use samples that require exposure to 98 °C (208 °F) in 5 minutes to extract RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates is currently testing its population for coronavirus more times per day than any other country, and has already tested its population more times.
It was developed through a combination of technology, and the purchase of large quantities of laboratory test kits from Group 42 and BGI (after their Huo-Yan rapid diagnostic laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab can perform the highest number of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first high-performance laboratory of its kind to be used outside China.
Multiple coronavirus testing methods will be tested in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved German technology for testing machines for use in developing countries that cannot afford to produce their own.
The German version was released on 17 January 2020; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention version was not available until 28 January; and the US version was not available.China and the United States were initially concerned about the inadequacy of their testing equipment, and these countries, including Australia, were unable to provide the required number of machines to meet the medical demand.
In contrast, experts say that South Korea's testing capabilities have reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, especially in private laboratories, have been developed for decades by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization stated that testing programs are the most effective way to slow down the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing as the disease spread has led to many US laboratories lacking the capacity to perform tests and the availability of fluids and diagnostic tests.
In March 2020, China reported that its testing equipment was not functioning properly.
In the United States, the testing equipment manufactured by the CDC was "defective", leading the government to lift restrictions on private laboratories performing the tests.Spain purchased the testing equipment from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company said that the negative results could be due to improper sampling or improper use of the machine.
The Spanish Ministry of Health announced that it would remove the test equipment that had produced negative results, and replace it with a new test equipment from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from China had negative results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test equipment from China but had negative results.
Prime Minister Matovič said that they were being dumped into the Danube.Turkish Health Minister Ates Kara said that the equipment that Turkey had purchased from China was "very poor quality" and was not "ready for use".The UK had purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 reported that they were not ready for use.
Testing, subsequent quarantine of infected individuals and follow-up of people who came into contact with SARS-COV-2 infected individuals have yielded positive results.
The study, which will be conducted in the Italian city of Vò, where the first case of COVID-19 in Italy was reported, will include two rounds of testing of nearly 3,400 people over a 10-day period.
Nearly half of the cases were asymptomatic, and all those infected were quarantined.
Foot traffic was restricted in the area, thus preventing some people from contracting the disease at all.
With strict contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the coronavirus 2020 in Singapore spread more successfully than in other developing countries, but without severe restrictions such as closing of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore imposed a curfew on 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March during the holiday season.
Several other countries have also taken similar measures to control the epidemic, including surveillance, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but some have been more moderate, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A data-driven study found that countries that support high screening rates had fewer deaths, perhaps those countries that were able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with testing capabilities and government laboratories that do not have a valid COVID-19 diagnosis submit the first results of the COVID-19 case and the first 10 positive results of the COVID-19 case to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories for review.
Of the 16 approved laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the percentage of cases reported is calculated according to the national testing standards.
Countries that test only on admission will have a higher percentage of new cases than countries that test all patients, symptomatic or not.
Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning hands to remove dirt, oil, germs, and other contaminants.
Washing hands with soap frequently at other important times of the day prevents the spread of infections to many people, such as diarrhea, which is caused by feces and is passed by mouth.
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as flu or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (such as body fluids).
The five critical hours a day when handwashing with soap is essential are: before and after shopping, after cleaning a baby's bowels or removing a litter, before feeding a baby, before eating and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with soap dust.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After removing and dressing the baby's washcloth or washing the baby from the toilet.
After touching your nose, coughing, or itching.
After touching animals, pet food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices during medical practice.
Washing hands before administering medication or treating a patient can prevent or reduce the spread of infection.
The primary purpose of hand washing for medical purposes is to remove harmful substances (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and other substances that can harm or cause disease.
It is important for people who handle food or medical professionals, but it is also important for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other diseases; preventing diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the rate of infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study found that regular handwashing may have a small impact on the growth of children under five.
In developing countries, the number of deaths from pneumonia and diarrhea among children could be reduced by making changes in habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the mortality rate of this disease by almost 50%.
Activities that encourage handwashing are three times more likely to cause diarrhea, and are as important as providing clean water in developing countries.
A 48% reduction in diarrheal disease can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap, the simplest and most cost-effective way to prevent infections such as diarrhoea and acute respiratory illness (ARI), is a must-have practice in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Acute Renal Infection (ARI) is the leading cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap and soap a habit before eating and after using the toilet could save more lives than any vaccine or treatment, halving diarrheal deaths and reducing deaths from chronic respiratory disease by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other water, sanitation and hygiene programs (THY).
Hand washing also protects against contagious infections.
The only drawback of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin and dry it out.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema, a skin rash, or hand dermatitis, a common medical condition.
Excessive hand washing is also one of the symptoms of an illness called OCD.
There are five key times in which handwashing with soap is important to reduce the rate of infection from feces: after going to the toilet (bathing, shopping), after washing the baby (removing and dressing the baby), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking food or handling raw meat, poultry or chicken.
Other instances when proper hand washing should be a practice to prevent the spread of disease include washing hands before and after treating a wound; after urinating, coughing, touching the nose; after handling animal waste or handling animal waste; and after handling litter.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is not common.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. In 2014, a study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was about 77 percent; and China was the lowest at 23 percent. Many industries now have changed their practices to wash their hands with soap and water at special times. Shared handwashing for students at set times is a common practice in developing countries to introduce it into children's habits.
The Health Benefits Program piloted by the Philippine Ministries of Education is an example of a program to promote children's health and literacy.
Detoxification twice a year, along with daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth brushing with toothpaste, are key components of the national program.
Women in Indonesia have used it and have had good results.
The best way to remove bacteria from the skin is to add soap or disinfectant to the water.
The main role of soaps and detergents is to open up the treatment process, and increase its effectiveness.
Water alone can also be a powerful cleanser because the fat and proteins, which are natural, are water-resistant.
However, cleaning is most effective when adequate water is added.
Hard soap, which can be reused, may contain bacteria from previous use.
A few studies that have examined the transmission of bacteria from one person to another have found that strong soaps are not pathogenic because they are washed off with a foam.
However, the CDC says that water soap without a touchscreen is the most effective way to prevent the spread of disease.
Many people recommend that health-care professionals use antibiotic-based soaps.
There is currently no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptics or antibiotics of choice is being promoted to kill this common pathogen
However, soaps often contain antibiotics that contain antibiotics such as triclosan, which is the main source of bacteria that live in the environment.
Thus, even if the antibiotics that are not selected for soap contain antibiotics, they are not always as effective as those that are used.
In addition to topical and skin care products, complex products may include acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, rubber acid) and pH stabilizers, benzoic acid, a disinfectant, and other skin softeners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal products).A study by the University of Oregon School of Public Health suggests that our soaps are as effective as triclosan-containing disinfectants in fighting infection and disinfecting the hands.
Low-quality handwashing water does not kill germs.
Germs grow rapidly in body temperatures of 37 °C.
However, soapy water is more effective at removing oil, dirt, and germs than cold water.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that using human water does not help to disinfect hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-resistant hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990's and early 2000's, water-free hand sanitizers (also called alcohol hand sanitizers, hand antiseptics, or hand creams) became popular.
Most are made with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a solution such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin in water, or a powder to improve the handling and reduce the drying power of alcohol.
The addition of liquid hydrogen peroxide increases the activity of the antibiotic.An antibiotic with 60 to 95% alcohol is effective in killing bacteria.
Alcohol-based antibiotics kill bacteria, fruit-resistant bacteria (MRSA and REV), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including AIDS, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Hand sanitizers with 70% alcohol are effective at killing 99.97% (log 3.5 to 35 decibels) of hand germs 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4-5 to 5 microbes) of hand germs 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizers are more effective at killing germs but less effective at killing other viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, which are often transmitted through the intestinal tract. An antiseptic or alcohol-based hand wash should be made that will either keep both hands wet or will cover them.
Before and after both hands and the palms and wash the fingernail tips for 30 seconds until the water, powder or gel dries.
Washing the fingernail tips and fingernails with both hands is recommended.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer, especially if the hands are very dirty.
Hand sanitizers are widely used because they are easy to use and quickly disinfect, but they cannot be used as a substitute for a good hand wash with water, but only if soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry out the skin unless a hand sanitizer is added.
The alcohol content of hand dryers can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other hand conditioners.
In human clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with hand softeners produced less skin irritation and were less hand-drying than soaps or disinfectants.
The skin was not usually red, the fruit was not produced, and the drug was not resistant to alcohol or other drugs.
The use of anti-inflammatory skin creams instead of soap and water for hand washing has become popular.
Although strong, water-based hand sanitizers do not remove organic matter from the hands, but they simply clean them.
Therefore, hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many germs, as they are more likely to stay on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is largely determined by the ingredients and manufacturing process, and appears to be lower than that of alcohol-based and non-alcoholic hand sanitizers.
In recent years, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to be more effective at killing bacteria after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose its potency with repeated use, perhaps because of its high skin tone.
In poorer areas, people can buy soap and use dirt or dust instead.
Dust or dirt may be stronger than water itself, but they are not as strong as soap.
One concern is that contaminated soil or dust can increase the spread of disease rather than prevent it.
The soap and dust are also cleaning agents because when mixed with water, they form an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends using dust or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
Proper handwashing practices recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease include the following:
Wash hands in hot or cold running water.
The use of moving water was recommended because players sitting together may be infected, and the temperature of the water is not relevant.
Wash hands with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap kills bacteria on the skin, and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands thoroughly and for longer periods of time after soap has dried than when using water alone.
Use soap for at least 20 seconds.
This helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and prolonged rinsing kills most bacteria.
Wipe your hands thoroughly with running water.
Wipe the dishes can increase the risk of hand infections.
Dry with a clean cloth or let air dry.
Wet hands are prone to infection. The areas that are most often not properly touched are the thumb, wrist, mid-finger, and under the fingernails.
Fake nails and nail polishes can contain bacteria.
The use of hand ointments is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry hands can damage the skin and lead to more serious illnesses.
Many low-cost lubricants can be used to help wash hands where water and/or soap are not available, such as pouring water from a top-loaded and properly-ventilated container or cup and/or using a dust collector if necessary in developing countries.Where water is scarce (such as in rural schools in developing countries), they are not able to save water, such as tippy-taps and other less expensive methods.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique using a tap that is fixed on a string, and is held by a string to pour some water over the hands and soap.
Drying hands properly is important for good health, but there is much debate about the best way to dry hands in the public toilet.
Several studies support that hand sanitizers are more effective than hand dryers in most toilets.
In 2008, a small study was conducted at the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a hand dryer manufacturer, to understand the differences between hand dryers, hand dryers and the new hand dryer.
After hand washing and drying with a hand dryer, the infection rate increased on the fingers by 194% and on the hands by 254%.
After hand washing and drying with a hand dryer, the infection rate increased on the fingers by 42% and on the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a hand sanitizer, the number of germs decreased, from 76% on the fingers to 77% on the hands.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether people using toilets and toilets spread germs after several hand sanitizers.
A hand dryer, which vents at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), could transmit germs to the hand in the toilet and to other people in the toilet up to 2 meters away.
Using a hand dryer spreads germs within 0.25 meters of the machine.
Hand dryers showed at least one of the microorganisms to be spreading.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt looked at several types of hand dryers.
The following differences in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and they vary from hand dryers to hand dryers.
Drying hands with hand dryers is another way to dry hands during travel if soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizers should contain 60% alcohol.
The use of hand sanitizers became widespread long after the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered their effectiveness (1846) in preventing the spread of disease in hospital settings.
There are many machines that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
One study found that the use of these drugs reduced the spread of disease.
Hand sanitizers are recommended for 15 seconds, with water and plenty of soap or ointment applied to all areas of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by joining them together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a little bit of a scraper can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in hand-washed water, it is important to remove the water and wipe it with a clean cloth.
After drying, use a dryer to hold water (and open the exit door if available).
This helps to prevent the hand from getting infected in these areas.
The purpose of hygienic hand washing is to remove contaminants (microbes) and avoid spreading them to others.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, in hospitals, hand washing is becoming increasingly rare, and many doctors and nurses often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
One study found that good hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the risk of blood transfusions by 66% in the case of people with high blood pressure.The World Health Organization published a guide to hand washing and hand wiping for medical use.
The organization's initial handwashing guidelines can be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and his associates made a key analysis.
The vending machines can also test and tell if the hands are clean, if the required level of hygiene is sufficient.
The World Health Organization has Five Hours for hand washing:
after contact with blood/ bodily fluid
before performing this hand sanitizer, and
after treating a patient. Adding antiseptic to soap (soap medicated or soap antibacterial) helps to disinfect hand sanitizer.
Disinfection may be necessary before surgery or in areas with high levels of bacteria. Rubbing hands during surgery, if necessary with a water pump that can be opened or closed without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine solution, a sterile hand wipe to dry hands after washing, and a sterile towel to remove dirt and other sterile material to remove dirt from the hands.
All the pearls must be removed.
This should be done by washing hands and forearms to the middle of the hand, preferably every 2 to 6 minutes.
Delaying the grinding process (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When wiping, you should prevent the water from passing from the front of the hands to the back of the hands.
After hand washing, dry hands with a disinfected cloth and wear a medical glove.
To prevent the spread of germs, it is recommended to wash hands or use hand antiseptic before and after treating a patient.
In clinical staph studies, the greatest benefit of handwashing was found after the first 20% handwashing, and the smallest benefit was found after the 35% handwashing.
Washing hands with soap increases the transmission of infectious bacteria to food by three times compared to washing hands with disinfected soap. Unlike handwashing with alcohol-based soap, washing hands with disinfected soap for 30 seconds reduces the transmission of infectious bacteria by 26% compared to disinfected soaps.
However, water soap is more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers for the treatment of influenza A virus H1N1 and clostridium difficile spores. Efforts to improve hand hygiene in hospitals may require training staff on hand hygiene, making available more alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and oral handwritten notes from staff.
There is a lot of research going on to determine which techniques will work in many areas of health.
In developing lands, washing hands with soap seems to be affordable, essential to health, and even essential to a healthy diet.
However, the lack of water, soap, and sanitation facilities at home, in schools, and at work places makes it difficult for everyone to get used to handwashing.
For example, in many parts of Africa, handwashing facilities near public or public toilets are scarce, although affordable options exist for providing handwashing facilities.
However, the fact that people wash their hands infrequently may be a matter of habit, not a matter of lack of soap and water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can influence policy making, promote key handwashing statements and help people make significant changes in their behaviour.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A review of 70 studies found that promoting handwashing in rural areas is important in LMICs, but that addressing the spread of the virus is less effective.One example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Steps" initiative that encourages schools to implement simple, low-cost measures that allow students to wash their hands with soap, among other sanitation measures.
If schools have succeeded in instilling some moral values, they can now move on to more rigorous ones.
The construction of handwashing facilities may be part of a campaign to spread handwashing to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality.
A global day of handwashing is another example of a religious campaign that is helping to change people's behaviour.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF is promoting the creation of handwashing emoji.
Other studies have looked at the overall rate of handwashing in developing countries in terms of DALYs.
However, one study suggests that encouraging handwashing with soap is less expensive than other methods, such as water and other hygiene measures.
The importance of hand washing for health reasons, especially for vulnerable populations such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand washing: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse".
At the time, many still believed that disease was caused by odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne and health-related illnesses prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase emphasis on hand hygiene and emphasize its importance in preventing the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have drawn international attention to the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent such outbreaks.
For example, signs with the words "good handwashing practices" were placed near public handwashing facilities and in office toilets and airports in Germany.
The phrase "wash one's hands of" something means to refuse to take responsibility for something or to participate in it.
It appeared in the Bible passage where Matthew records that Pontius Pilate washed his hands in deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a common phrase in English-speaking lands.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Mother Macbeth begins to wash her hands to cleanse the mind of the impurity that reflects her misunderstanding of the terrible crimes she committed and that she instigated her husband to commit.
It has been found that after being reminded of bad habits or when they themselves are reminded of them, people are more likely to wash their hands than others, and they are more likely to appreciate handwashing products.
Furthermore, individuals who are allowed to wash their hands after these frequent recitals are less likely to participate in other more rigorous hygiene activities, such as volunteer work.
In religion, hand washing is required for both purity and symbolic purposes. The use of hand washing, which uses water instead of soap to wash hands, is a belief in hand washing in many religions, such as Baha'i, Hindu, Tevilah and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims are required to wash their hands before and after eating.
Safety measures at work COVID-19
Occupational safety equipment for COVID-19 uses safety and health measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best occupational safety and health measures are based on the workplace and the workplace, the risk of exposure to hazardous substances, the extent of disease transmission in the community, and the risk of COVID-19 for workers.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a low-risk job is one that requires minimal contact with others and coworkers, requires the use of basic safety measures, such as hand washing, encourages employees to stay home if they are sick, have respiratory illnesses, and maintains a clean and hygienic workplace.
Medium-risk work is work that requires frequent or close contact with people who are known or likely to have COVID-19, but who may be ill due to contact with large numbers of people or international travel.
This applies to those who work in public places, such as schools, workplaces, and other public places.
Prevention of risks in this group, in addition to the usual preventive measures, includes the use of ventilators with high-pressure filters, precautions against itching, and the use of personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers physicians and morgue staff who are known or likely to have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 to be at high risk, and therefore those who work with aerosols or who handle or collect samples from people with or who may have COVID-19 are at high risk.
Ensure that occupations that may involve exposure to air pollution are adequately protected and that appropriate protective clothing is provided for such occupations.
The COVID-19 outbreak can be a significant risk in the workplace.
Employees may not be able to work because they are sick, have to care for others, or are afraid of contact with an infected person.
The business model may change, including the products that people want to buy, and the way in which they can obtain those products (e.g. shopping at busy times or through home delivery services).
Finally, travel to areas with high COVID-19 prevalence may be restricted.
The plans should address the level of risk in the workplace and workplace, including the people you will be exposed to, the potential for increased risk at home and elsewhere, and the risks to workers such as the elderly or those with chronic illnesses.
It also discusses how to manage these risks and how to manage the consequences of the disease.
Preparation for and response to epidemics will be determined by national or local legislation.
Effective response to disease-related issues includes reducing the risk of transmission among employees, protecting those at high risk of developing pre-existing conditions, maintaining the workforce, and taking measures to avoid disrupting the work of other companies with which you work.
How you respond will depend on how deeply the disease has penetrated your brain.
Individual safety measures are an accepted way to protect workers and the health of as many people as possible.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective response is to rely on automated testing, after a thorough review by the authorities, and finally to provide adequate personal protective equipment.
Monitoring machines means keeping workers away from workplace hazards without compromising work ethics, and can be a good way to do things.
Management review is changing the way work is done, requiring a change in employer or employee behavior.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less robust than mechanical or official checks, but can help to prevent certain risks.
Each type of PPE should be selected based on the risks to the worker, if appropriate (e.g. respirators), worn properly and at all times, maintained, and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, washed, repaired or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the minimum occupational hazards are those that require fewer contacts with people and co-workers.
The best ways to prevent the spread of infection in a licensed workplace are to wash hands regularly, encourage employees to stay home if they are sick, have respiratory illnesses, cover their mouth or nose if they cough or itch, have disposable wipes and wipes, maintain remote communication or other devices if necessary to prevent employees from using other people's tools, and maintain hygiene and sanitation practices in the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of potential patients is a very effective way to protect employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms stay home until fever, fever symptoms, and other symptoms resolve within 24 hours without the use of antipyretic or other anti-symptomatic drugs, and that appropriate policies be established for adequate leave, allowing employees to stay home to protect family members of ill employees, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, the average occupational risk is associated with situations where people who are in close contact with or within 1.8 meters of people who have COVID-19 or who have had contact with them may be exposed, but may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 because of the high prevalence of the disease in the workplace, or because people have recently traveled to countries where COVID-19 is prevalent.
It affects workers who are exposed to a wide range of people, such as in schools, high-risk workplaces, and other crowded areas. Maintenance of machines for such workers requires the installation of strong air filters, high-speed ventilation, isolation devices such as itch-proofing, and window blinds for customers. Protecting employees from high-risk groups will require encouraging sick workers to stay at home, holding online meetings instead of in one place, avoiding unnecessary travel to COVID-19-affected areas, developing communication and forums in public health settings, and providing new workers with appropriate protective measures against COVID-19 risks by wearing protective clothing and protective gear, including protective gear, and providing training and equipment to protect them from the risks of COVID-19.
Workers in this category do not require respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, the best way to protect the crew and other passengers is to keep them at a distance of 6 feet, appoint a flight crew member to care for the patient, and provide a face mask or ask the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a cloth when coughing or itching.
Cabin crew should wear a bagan when handling a sick passenger or touching bodily fluids or any other potentially contagious area, and should take special precautions if the patient develops fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Bags and other waste after use should be disposed of in a safe manner, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected.For commercial ships, including cruise passengers and other passengers, prevention means avoiding travel if you are sick, and isolating yourself and informing the emergency medical services immediately if any passenger has fever or other symptoms.
It is recommended to monitor the health of the patient in the facility. For schools or child care facilities, the CDC may require temporary closure of the facility for sanitation or disinfection if a patient was in the school premises regardless of the prevalence of the disease in your community.
If the spread of the disease is limited, social distancing measures may be used such as restricting travel, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or school chores or eating out in restaurants, including distance between offices, waiting for arrival and departure times, avoiding unnecessary visits, and using separate medical facilities for children with flu symptoms.
If there is a high incidence of disease in your community, in addition to the precautionary measures, schools may be temporarily closed.For police officers who are on duty in a routine capacity, the CDC recommends a low risk level.
Police officers who are required to be in contact with people who are or may be infected with COVID-19 should follow the same precautions as medical personnel, including wearing appropriate protective equipment.
If you touch someone while they are being touched, they should clean and disinfect their workwear and equipment before using them, using a vacuum cleaner and following safety and disposal guidelines for PPE and for clothing.
OSHA considers certain medical and mortuary personnel to be at high risk or at high risk.
High-risk occupations include childbirth, care, laboratory work, and transportation of patients who have or may have COVID-19.
They are at increased risk if they are involved in aerosol operations, or collect or use samples from people who have or may have COVID-19.
Aerosol operations are operations such as intubation, cough treatment, bronchoscopy, or other dental procedures or examinations, or the acquisition of echinacea.
The most significant risk of morgue operations is for those who work on the morgue preparation of COVID-19 victims at the time of death or suspected victims; they are at greater risk after subsequent diagnosis of the cause of death.
In some hospitals and morgues, ventilation may be beneficial.
Samples should be used in accordance with biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be separated into separate waiting areas depending on whether they have been exposed to COVID-19.In addition to the recommendation to use respiratory aids such as PPE, OSHA recommends that people work within 6 feet of known SARS-CoV-2 infected, contagious, or infected people, and perform other aerosol activities.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or higher should be used extensively in respiratory prevention activities such as adjustment testing, training, and medical examinations.
Some types of respiratory aid are more protective and helpful for people to work more efficiently.WHO does not recommend full-face masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO will require only medical masks for the testing of healthcare providers.
For people who collect respiratory samples from patients, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol spray, the WHO recommends the use of medical masks, safety glasses, or face shields, blouses, and bags.
If you are working in aerosol dispensing, use a N95 or FFP2 respirator instead of a medical mask.
Because all available PPE is not sufficient, WHO recommends limiting the use of telemedicine PPE, restricting contact such as open windows, allowing medical personnel access to the patient's room with COVID-19, using only the PPE necessary for specific work, continuing to use the same respiratory aid without removing it when treating multiple patients, maintaining and using other PPE safely, and not recommending the use of masks for asymptomatic patients.

THE HISTORY: [Covid-19] Lighting the way and preparing for the future
The following is a list of all the different ways The Greatest Showman is credited in the database.
Copyright: CC0: Not included
This month is a very exciting one.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that we are all connected and responsible to one another.
We do not know what the consequences will be, but we do know that our successful efforts to combat it are based on the strength, solidarity, and community that are central to this organization.
The friendliness and affection we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, phone calls, and chats are a sure sign that we are working with the best people.
I thank you all very much and I am happy to have confidence in you.
Last week someone told me how much they appreciated our work.
It reminded me how important it is that people go to Wikipedia now, and it's a strong indication that valuable work should be online and accessible to everyone.
Your work is what makes this possible, whether it's updating our social media accounts, paying our friends, or protecting our community.
Right now, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is a time when the world will not only care about what we do, but also how we do it.
Because of the importance of this work and your role, we will change the way we work together, starting this week.
Changes in Our Roles and Schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-group met last night to discuss our work plan and schedule for the coming days and months.
In these articles, we discuss what we think is the best way to deal with the challenges we face and how best to keep our organization going in this time.
We want to relieve stress and support our ministry for the long haul.
If you want to call us, that's fine.
For managers, entrepreneurs and employees in general:
Our daily work schedule will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week until we change it.
You are not on leave - if you can work more hours, you can be hired.
However, the world is uncertain, and whether you need to care for a loved one, go shopping, or see a doctor, his or her health should be your priority.
We will not monitor your work schedule.
If you are sick, do not come to work.
It should be done without saying it, but we will say it.
Don't need sick days or PTO - just tell your boss and help your coworkers to plan their schedule so that important things can continue.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please contact Bryan within T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide you with support and assistance to ensure proper care by the authorities).
They will be paid full time.
We have honored that promise, and we reaffirm our commitment to upholding our agreements with our contractors and colleagues on fixed hours.
All are paid according to their regular hours of work.
It also depends on whether you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people use work as a way to share their anxieties with others.
What we do can be very helpful, especially in times like these.
It will also affect your own defense.
We will ask you to speak to your supervisor, so that we can discuss what we can do and make appropriate adjustments.
Some activities are considered essential.
There are other things we need to continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising (including) organizations perform essential functions that may require additional support.
We will work with all departments to identify our new goals and focus now on supporting the main areas of our work.
We all have a lot to do, but we will focus on the most important things.
If we become discouraged now, we will not be hurt later.
We do not intend to work twice as hard to recover once the disease is gone.
We will not require you to work overtime to complete work on dates that are not currently necessary.
We will accept the changes, and we will adjust to setting new goals and dates wherever they are most important.
What will happen to the APP (annual planning)?
To accommodate the new conditions and daily working hours, we would like to change the publication date of our annual planning for 2020-2021.
Our proposal is to request an extension of our 2019-2020 schedule to allow us to implement financial planning measures that will allow our employees to focus on essential activities, protecting themselves, and protecting their loved ones while we consider who should or want to work the extra hour in the coming weeks.
The extension of the deadline will significantly increase the workload on current issues and pressure on the entire organization.
We will send our proposal to the authorities next week and inform our representatives and teams of the next steps to take once we receive the official response.
We would like to thank the APP team for taking care of these projects.
Office status, health risks, and cleanliness
Last week, we were informed that a friend of ours may have been in contact with someone who is infected with COVID-19.
However, as a precaution, we used disinfectant to clean the entire office of Francisco.
The hospital disinfected the entire area, including the entrance and elevators to our offices.
The building is operated according to its own rules.
We are relieved to know that the office will be even better when we return.
Our DC office is hosted on WeWork, which has provided us with its COVID-19 precautions and made them available to all DC employees.
Last week, our DC office was upgraded to work remotely based on guidance from San Francisco.
As some of our friends in NYC know, we also had discussions about finding a place in Brooklyn.
The following articles are awaited.
Some of our friends will be serving away for the first time.
Our longtime friends who work remotely know that change can happen, and we would like to offer some suggestions:
Make the meeting an hour or two long.
If it takes longer, see if you can do it in a few days.
Clearly identify the purpose of the meeting, what will be discussed, and send out the notes in advance.
Specify the video to be used, with tools such as Google Doc and Zoom to make live chat more efficient and secure.
Have a moderator to help ensure that each meeting is a success, someone to answer the chat for questions and references from the list of speakers, and someone to help with the notes (or help each other with the notes).
Email IT support if you need a good headset.
Spend your health money on food.
Join the Slack #remoties channel to chat with your friends about work
The HR team will host online conferences for guidance to help monitor the vast amount of work that is available for the Foundation.
Last week, we announced that all publicly funded Wikipedia events, such as editathons, would be suspended until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We will explain that we understand that requests to cancel these meetings and other restrictions may make it difficult to implement the agreements and that we will not be held responsible for postponing or changing these plans.
In the coming weeks, we will be introducing new guidelines to Wikimania and other regional and networking events.
Our global community is saddened by the termination of these services but relieved by the significance and ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and other issues.
To this end, CRT is planning to create Meta-Wiki pages to provide communities with a platform to monitor our influence and discussions with one another.
Stay informed about COVID-19
We will post an invitation to our calendar on Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share new information, answer your questions, and spend time with each other.
We are with you in this matter and will help you as much as we can.
While you wait, you can continue to follow the news in this email, as well as other relevant information about COVID-19, on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will continue to update these pages and consolidate all information.
We will also endeavor to keep in touch with our brothers in the countries most affected by the disease.
If you have any questions about travel, meetings, work, or how to deal with problems, or any other matter that requires assistance, feel free to report and make a successful claim to the CRT.
We are there to provide support and assistance when needed.
If you have a confidential or important matter, contact Bryan Judan - HR's global operations director.
No one should see these changes as a compromise on our responsibilities and our work.
However, it is also aware that in this era, our work and responsibilities will change in ways that have not changed.
These are steps we believe are necessary to help each other continue to operate, provide our community with the support it needs, and serve a world that is more trustworthy.
Our planned work will wait until it is finished.
Now is the time to help one another and to make room for the special work that is to come in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We want you all to make it happen, so we urge you all to protect yourselves and your families so that they can be strong enough to cope with the crisis.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The film was directed by David S. Burroughs, produced by David S. Burroughs, and stars Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the entire cast (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found in the outer (cell membranes) of the lungs, muscles, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by lowering the level of angiotensin-II and increasing ang ((1-7) making it a potent treatment for heart disease. ACE2 is also involved in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses.
The human enzyme is called hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a metalloenzyme found in zinc on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is a N-terminal peptidease M2 and a C-terminal receptor of the nasal amino acid transporter.
ACE2 forms a type of single-protein membrane, with its enzyme-binding activity in the outer membrane of cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is translocated from the transmembrane to another enzyme called sheddase, then the protein is released into the bloodstream and then excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is expressed in many organs: ACE2 binds to the cell membrane of type II lung alveolar enterocytes of the small intestine, arteries and endothelial veins and muscle of the soft tissue of the organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of aCE2 is to act as an ACE.
ACE binds angiotensin I hormones to angiotensin II vasoconstriction, which is a condition in which the blood vessels of the body are constricted.
ACE2 is bound to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine by angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-pPhe) and is co-hydrolyzed by the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to many peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane blockage of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 in Hartnup syndrome.
In addition to the transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point for coronavirus cells, as well as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In general, the binding of the S1 protein tip of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV2 by the ACE2 enzyme on the cell surface will lead to endocytosis and the co-transmission of the enzyme virus into the endosomes of the cells.
This entry site requires the modification of protein S by serine protease TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential effective therapy. This has led some people to reduce ACE2 in their cells, in an attempt to fight infection.
However, a few academic and legal societies recommend that the recommended ACE and ARB therapy be continued.
A systematic review and meta-study published on 11 July 2012 found that treating ACE reduces the risk of pneumonia by 34%.
However, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in ACE-treated subjects who were at a higher risk of developing pneumonia, as in those with heart disease.
ACE treatment was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia mortality, but the results were less severe than the risk of pneumonia.
Human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel therapy for pulmonary hypertension, and has been used to treat pulmonary hemodynacy and oxygen saturation in pigs with lypopolysaccharemia in respiratory distress syndrome.
The short half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and it will be active for 30 minutes with a 24-hour interval.
Several studies suggest that rhACE2 may be an effective treatment for patients with renin-angiotensin resistance (RAS inhibitors) or severe angiotensin deficiency. rhACE2 is being studied clinically for the treatment of respiratory distress.
BCOVID-19 apps are mobile applications designed to track people who may have been exposed to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. For example, how to identify (person) who may have been in close contact with an infected person.
Many applications were made, and with government support in some places.
Many of the methods of surveillance have been developed through mobile phone applications.
People are not interested in the way it looks at people's private lives, like systems that track people's locations.
One of the most sensitive of these is the Bluetooth signal that will tell you if you are near other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would be rolling out Bluetooth support for the app on both Android and iOS.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, developed an application that allows citizens to identify if they have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19.
It is being implemented in 200 cities in China, with an application called TraceTogether being developed in Singapore.
The application was developed by local IT experts, made available for public use and will be distributed to the government.North Macedonia has launched StopKorona!, a Bluetooth application that will detect contact with an infected person and support the government's health campaign.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology at the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that a social tracking application was in progress, and would be available in the coming weeks.Similar applications are underway in Ireland, and in France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are planning to use the Singapore TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocols.Russia is developing an application to detect COVID-19 cases in Moscow, which will be used to monitor and restrict out-of-doors travel.
Ross Anderson, a professor of engineering security at the University of Cambridge, described the potential for such applications, including false positives, and the difficulty of making them work because the application can only be used by a limited number of people in the community.
In response to concerns about the potential impact of the coronavirus, Apple has limited the number of organizations that can install apps on the App Store, limiting it to government employees or other high-profile organizations.
Google and Amazon have also implemented these rules.
People who have been fighting the stigma of privacy for security reasons have questioned whether there are adequate facilities for this work and whether it will be destroyed in the aftermath of the coronavirus.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for a ban on surveillance.
The organizations have listed seven recommendations that governments can follow:
Watchful observance of the Sacrifice and the Efficiency.
There must be a time to end the vigil;
Statistics will be made only for COVID-19;
The information and names of individuals should be kept confidential;
Computer-based surveillance should be done without prejudice;
Distribution of numbers to persons outside the workplace to be regulated by written regulations;
There must be a way to protect the community and help if anyone suffers because of this worker;
Everyone involved in this work for all people is needed, including health workers and the homeless.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also written their recommendations.
Google and Apple's plans call attention to the need to remove the surveillance system when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have enabled online tracking rather than in-app tracking, which eliminates the need for an app and allows people to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network monitoring was approved.
A lookout is also a way of keeping an eye on unnecessary items.
However, not all systems require location sensing; most surveillance systems are based on intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, they have moved to a non-app-based approach.
In the case of the application, information was collected from various sources such as telephone, credit cards, and used to alert people via SMS of possible infections.
And they informed those who had also passed through, and the government made the area public, which is legal because it happened during the MERS pandemic that occurred in the country.
Information that is accessible to everyone through a variety of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have been working on implementing a system of internal surveillance.
As of 6 April 2020, it has not been released.
Monitoring is well known, with several studies dating back to 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen students were developing systems that could monitor human activity, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to detect proximity to a mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a powerful internal and external protocol, and there are no specific guidelines for its use.External protocols are similar to Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact (TCN. fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensible Protocols and Telephone Tracking Mechanisms.
Under these protocols, confidentiality is not compromised, and all communication is done over the phone.
The MIT Media Lab and the Private Group are developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-enhancing services to access and support the site or monitor social media to help monitor the spread of COVID-19.
Based on a white paper study Apps Gone Rogue: Protecting Personal Data in the Pandemic  Released in March 2020. Another project was SafeTrade by Enigma MPZ, a technology development company that started as a collaboration at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrade enables automated data processing to allow people to choose whether to share their location and health information with third parties and government agencies, without violating data privacy laws.
On 5 April 2020, the Global Coalition of TCN launched a global collaborative approach, which aimed to reduce human suffering, and facilitate global inter-operability through the development and deployment of applications, essential for global adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had implemented BlueTrace protocols in its government agencies.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the Android and IOS development companies, announced a project to support social tracking while protecting privacy, based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography.
They also published a document outlining the internal technology to be used.
For Apple and Google, the system will be implemented in three stages:
Developing tools to develop a public-private partnership application to support government privacy.
Installing on IOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple want to address privacy concerns by installing the system on the operating system, and then removing it automatically
Drug design (also called drug therapy) is the use of a drug to treat a disease or condition for which it was developed.
It is a term of scientific study that is being pursued to develop an effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other studies are pursuing the pathway to a vaccine for COVID-19 and plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has 66 active vaccines, all of which have a ligand-based substrate.
Identifying contact areas provides potential work to determine the efficacy of a treatment for COVID-19.
For SARS-CoV-2, the proteins are the protease papain, RNA polymerase-linked RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA in the al study studied a combination of multiple-individual studies that appeared to identify skeletal effects of a potential drug that could lead to a cure for SARS-CoV-2 as well as a potential cure.
Chloroquine is a herbal medicine used to treat diseases of the immune system.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs in the Joint Drug Trials.
New York State Governor Andrew Cumo announced that a clinical trial of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York City on March 24.On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate in the United States.
The FDA has not approved the drug for clinical trials but it was approved in the USA as an experimental drug for high-risk patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment.
The CDC states that the use, dosage, and duration of hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
Doctors say they use this medicine only when there is no other option.
A study in Turkey is being conducted in Istanbul to determine the effects of chloroquine when combined with Zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin D.
Larger studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is testing the efficacy and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.
In China, clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that Favipavir was "extremely potent".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in 4 days, but the incubation period was 11 days in 45 patients who were not treated.
In a study conducted in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency has advised the public about the results of the drug at an early stage.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the vaccine from Japan, using a pipeline to transport the vaccine to university hospitals, where it will be developed to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has warned the Trump administration against buying the drug, which may be less effective in patients with severe illness and high levels of virus.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to conceive.
A lopinavir/ritonavir strain (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, was found to be Mildly active.
These drugs are designed to prevent the HIV virus from growing in the body.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is developing a vaccine to develop a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the global trial schedule.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg disease.Gilead Sciences has identified remdesivir as a key in vitro agent in the treatment of multiple phyllo-, pneumonic-, paramyso-, and coronaviruses.
One of the features of the drug is its ability to fight off the virus when it becomes too resistant to the body and becomes a serious pathogen and spreads between people.
One of the early studies suggests that Remdesivir may be more potent. Several studies are underway, including two being conducted at the University of Cleveland; one for patients with moderate to severe disease and one for patients with severe disease.
Three clinical trials are currently underway to identify vitamin C in patients with severe COVID-19 infection; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one non-controlled (Italy).
New York City began clinical trials of azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is currently developing a trial of Teijin's drug Alvesco (ciclesonide), a respiratory asthma treatment for patients with the novel coronavirus.
A Phase II trial of an angiotensin-containing enzyme 2 is being conducted in 200 critically ill patients in hospitals in Denmark, Germany and Austria to evaluate the efficacy of the drug.
Studies at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in Montreal have identified the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and respiratory complications in people with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, included 6,000 individuals over the age of 40 who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have adequate contraception are not allowed to enter.
Many anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight is becoming increasingly common in the treatment of patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines for its use.
A study of 300 patients with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis and dosage was initiated in Italy on April 14.
For example, SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, which is being studied for its potential replication, and is the same drug used during the MERS, SARS and West Nile virus pandemics.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is safe for COVID-19 following the 7th Chinese recommendation
Umefenovir: Umifenovir is safe for COVID-19 following China's 7th recommendation
Other medications that have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): It is approved in China.
And tests in Italy and China. See also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The bCOVID-19 vaccine is not valid for the 2019 virus (COVID-19).
No vaccine has ever passed the testing phase, and much work is still being done to develop a viable vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the virus of origin, was not expected to be available for at least 18 weeks.
Five vaccines were in Phase I in April.
COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019.
The global pandemic of 2020 required significant resources and resources to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are supporting genomics that were developed for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
They concluded in April that CEPI's strength in vaccine development is its speed, ability to produce on a large scale, its ability to deliver on a large scale, and its ability to make it available to the world.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technologies were under study in early 2020 to develop a more robust vaccine against COVID-19.
Several sites have been included in Phase I clinical trials to assess the efficacy of the vaccine:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I modification and candida vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vectors (Phase I of the study and candida: CanSino biology, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 vaccines were in early development, 78 were approved as projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more, but little is known about them (either in development or in development).
Phase I-II trials evaluate the efficacy of a drug and include immunoassays, randomized controlled trials, placebo controlled trials, and multiple sites, and determination of dosage.
Phase III trials involve large numbers of subjects and a team of investigators, and clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug in preventing disease, all by monitoring the effects of the dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in development since early April 2020, 74 have not been successfully tested in humans (they were still in clinical trials).
In Australia on 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland reported that it was investigating whether a vaccine molecule could interact with a viral protein to induce an immune response.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had begun work on a vaccine, with possible human trials beginning in 2021.
Vaccine trials were launched by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and by the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced that he and his colleague Vaxart were working on a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a vaccine manuscript with a technology under development for a vaccine and a cancer treatment.
On 25 March the head of the research institute announced that the synthesis had been completed and the trial had begun.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immune-Ongology, announced that it was launching a vaccine project to develop a key peptide for a COVID-19 vaccine.
They wanted to develop a Candida vaccine that could be tested in at least 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St Louis announced that it had begun work on a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the US National Health and Human Services Laboratory and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Laboratory, both in eastern Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Novavax Inc.
In the search for and development of vaccines.
They also announced that clinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial would begin in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health said it was working on 11 fronts, and even if they were moving quickly it would take between one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec announced that it was developing a novel coronavirus particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine is currently in laboratory trials, with human trials expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had given CureVac a large sum of money to buy a COVID-19 vaccine that the German government had blocked.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced that it was partnering with the German company BioNTech to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 Candida, an mRNA-based vaccine, is currently in clinical trials that are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would have results of its first clinical trial in April 2020 and that its final vaccine could be tested on humans in the summer.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million funding round for a COVID-19 vaccine study team at the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total CEPI funding for COVID-19 to $29 million.
Other members of the CEPI team for the COVID-19 vaccine include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London said that on 20 March 2020, they would begin development of an RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
Candida vaccine was developed 14 days after the recommendation from China.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 COVID-19 studies, as well as several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, including Medicago and a position at the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million was being spent primarily on developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with the intention of building a national vaccine bank to provide more new vaccines in case of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA-induced SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunit was found to have antigen-specific strong antibodies in response [in mice] that were valid for 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine for nasal spray.
Using insect repellents, DNA will be adapted to be corre-replicated in human mice to produce resistant viral fragments, potentially stimulating the human immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in collaboration with cloud computing services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, which are called non-specific effects.
This means they may have benefits after their illness stops.
A randomized controlled trial in Australia is seeking to recruit 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible that the vaccines they are administering may not be safe and effective.
Early evidence for the validity of COVID-19-specific vaccines using animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and monkey primates, points to the safety of level 3 containment measures to control live viruses, and international consensus on the use of safe standard vaccines.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have not been tested in human models.
Until 2020, there is no cure or vaccine available to eliminate or prevent SARS and to administer it safely and successfully to humans.
Following the publication of the MERS-CoV memos in 2005 and 2006, the development of new vaccines and therapies to treat SARS was a priority for public health agencies worldwide.
Prior to the MERS outbreak, it was believed that the newly developed SARS detection could provide an important template for developing vaccines for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one human MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I human clinical trials, and three others were in the pipeline, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Posters on social media have promoted the idea of a conspiracy that the virus that causes COVID-19 has been identified and a vaccine has been developed for it.
Patents on social media posters of the species are cited as references to previous patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for certain strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) is a viral infection of the lungs caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SRAS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, voice pain, nausea, abdominal pain.
The incidence and onset of symptoms is a five-day interval but can range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases have mild symptoms, but some result in severe inflammation and organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, bringing the total death toll to more than 153,000.
More than 568,000 cases of whooping cough have been reported. The virus is mainly transmitted between infected individuals, mainly through small amounts of urine released during coughing, coughing or speaking.
These droplets also leak into the respiratory tract, but they often fall to the ground or to the side of a nearby throat infection.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in the environment for up to 72 hours.
It is most common in the first three days of onset of symptoms, but transmission may occur before symptoms appear and during the post-exposure period.The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reverse chain reaction polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in nasal swabs.
The use of face masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
The policy on the use of masks in public varies, with some authorities refusing to use them, others mandating them, and others insisting on their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19.
The distribution of a disease zone has been recorded in dozens of countries in all WHO headquarters.
Individuals infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
Symptoms of dizziness include shortness of breath, pain in the chest or pressure, loss of consciousness, painful swelling, and facial or lip bleeding; immediate medical attention is required if such symptoms occur.
In rare cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sinusitis, runny nose or sore throat may occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been reported in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can lead to liver disease, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is generally five to six days but ranges from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop them within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that not all people with infection develop symptoms.
The cause of these asymptomatic carriers in the distribution is not yet fully understood; however, early signs suggest that they may have a side effect.
The prevalence of asymptomatic infections is currently unknown and is under investigation, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases are asymptomatic with hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began classifying asymptomatic cases into one-day cases on April 1; of the 166 total cases that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The saliva may contain a high viral load.
Speaking loudly is more effective than many sounds in normal speech.
A Singaporean study found that a cough without a lid can carry a person's cough to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences says bioaerosol dispersion is possible and air samples from airways outside public restrooms have yielded positive RNA samples for the virus.
Other medical procedures such as tubal ligation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause airway obstruction and airway diffusion.
The concern is that it can be spread through snow, a risk that is generally accepted. The virus is more susceptible to isolation if people are symptomatic; although transmission can occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that it is not yet known how easily the disease spreads, with one person typically infecting two or three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to persist on cartons for up to one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, this is the difference between humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap products cut through the oil layer, protect against viruses, remove them, and remove them from bags or other areas.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are more effective.In a Hong Kong study, urine samples were collected within two days of admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed an increase in viral load at the end, while the sixth patient had an increase in viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated in three cases of acute respiratory infection in Wuhan.
All strains of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus contain a coronavirus that has become naturally localized.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by a soap-based, natural defense mechanism.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organ to COVID-19 as the virus enters the host cell via the angiotensin-convertant enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, a human enzyme that is abundant in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
A severe cardiac arrest was reported in 12% of patients hospitalized with epilepsy in Wuhan, China, and is a common cause of acute coronary syndrome.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is elevated, usually as a result of systemic inflammatory response to immune system pain during the course of the disease, but myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The incidence of thrombosis (31%) and arteriovenous thromboembolism (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 complications and may be associated with poor prognosis.The surgical evaluation of COVID-19 deaths has shown a decrease in diffuse alveolar function (DAD), as well as lymphocyte-derived inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is tropismic to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients are more likely to have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In the study, GM-CSF-producing pathogenic T cells were shown to be correlated with recruitment of IL-6 induced inflammatory and chronic liver disease pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in surgery.
The WHO has published a number of test protocols for the disease.
The standard method for assay treatment is real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A special test is performed on breath samples taken using a nasal swab and a throat swab; however, a nasal swab or a saliva swab may also be used.
Results will usually be known within the next few hours or two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples two weeks apart and results with low-value rapidity.
Chinese researchers were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and published a genetic sequence so that international laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect viral infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and previous infections) was upgraded, but not yet widely used.
Chinese experience with test-taking suggests that its accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The US FDA approved the first screening test on 21 March 2020 for human use at the end of the month.The diagnostic support suite at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggests methods for detecting clinical signs of infection and epidemiological risk.
Multilbar opacities of the two-sided peripheral, asymmetric and posterior glass are common in primary disorders.
Subpleural dominance, spinal pavement (swelling of the septic lobe with alveolar saturation varies), and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
Very little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main autopsy findings are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the spleen and pulmonary edema.
Four types of painful lower back pain can be observed:
soft tissue: swelling of the tissue, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of large multinucleated cells
acute painful pulmonary: distal alveolar diffusion (DAD) distal alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxemia.
pulmonary embolism: exudate formation between the alveolar cavities and interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: blockage of the intravesical bloodstream (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to prevent and reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding public areas, washing hands with soap and water frequently for 20 seconds, using respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with unclean hands on eyes, nose, or mouth.
The CDC recommendation is to cover the nose and mouth with a mask during the treatment of acute kidney injury and recommend the use of a hand mask if the mask is missing.
True purity after conscientiousness is urgently required.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public, in part to limit the spread of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce the number of infected people and the closure of schools and workplaces, restricting travel and closing public places.
The safety distance also ensures that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no known effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19. While vaccine development is not expected to be complete by 2021, the key to curbing COVID-19 is hopefully to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, a process known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after going to the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating food; and after rinsing, coughing, and urinating.
It has been recommended to use 60% alcohol products for hand sanitizers, but only when soap and water are not available.In areas where traditional hand sanitizers are not available for sale, the WHO has introduced sterilization formulations.
In these formulations, the insecticidal activity is increased from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacteria from alcohol; it is a "sustaining ingredient for hand antiseptic".
Glycerol is added to the compote.
People are treated with supportive care devices that can include hydrotherapy, oxygen support, and organ support.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of carrying the virus wear a white face mask.
External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat severe respiratory distress, but its efficacy is still being studied.
Personal hygiene in lifestyle and diet is recommended to improve immunity.
Treatment support may be necessary for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of an outbreak.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued guidelines for treating people in hospital beds for COVID-19.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the U.S. have developed treatment options from various agencies and free resources, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some doctors recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen in the initial treatment.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities that provide services that may release aerosols such as aerosol spray or hand sanitizer.
For healthcare professionals who are monitoring COVID-19 patients, the CDC has mandated a Personal Airborne Infection Quarantine (AIIR) in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions and ventilation precautions.The CDC has provided support for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Materials recommended for use include: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical equipment.When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of all Aircraft Use Authorization (USAA) masks.
It is designed to protect against airborne dust but its safety in the environment is not guaranteed when used.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or, at a minimum, homemade masks.
The overall incidence of COVID-19 is not high enough to require the use of ventilation or other means, but the percentage of cases that require it is low.
The type of respiratory support for patients with COVID-19 respiratory infection is being studied extensively for hospitalized patients, with the implication that the tube insertion can be avoided by high ventilation through the respiratory cannula or at two-level positive pressure.
But it is not known whether either of these two drugs has the same benefits for people with chronic illness.
Some doctors have chosen an intra-corporal ventilator if necessary, as this technique prevents the spread of particles into the head using a high-pressure nasal air cannula.Severe cases are more common in older adults (over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries lack adequate hospital beds for individuals, which limits the health system's ability to handle the increasing number of COVID-19 cases that are not adequately hospitalized.
A study in China found that of the 5% of patients admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% were ventilated, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 hospitalizations end up in the ICU.
Automated ventilation has become more complicated as the severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS) has worsened with COVID-19 and oxygenation has become more difficult.
Ventilators with a pressure controlled mode at high PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen supply while reducing the risk of airway and chest trauma.
Strong PEEP may be missing from older ventilators.
Research into potential therapies began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most promising drug available.
While new drugs may be available by 2021 for clinical trials, many of the investigational drugs are already approved for use in certain diseases or are in the early stages of clinical trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe disease.
The WHO has sent volunteers to participate in a trial to evaluate the safety of the vaccine devices being developed.The FDA has granted temporary approval for plasma from survivors on the basis of clinical trials in cases where life-threatening or life-threatening conditions are identified.
It has not yet undergone clinical trials to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for the control of disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to try to stop the pandemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app has a history of identifying "third-party contacts" using surveillance data and is therefore vulnerable to interference.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
In case of a potential threat, the app will not only require the person to quarantine but also alert local health authorities.Extensive mobile sensing data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, medical records are being developed to track contacts of infected people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus cases.
The measure was introduced to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed mobile phone data centers in collaboration with the German federal agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to detect and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had received a notification from mobile phone operators that "40% of the population was still on the move".
The German government recently launched a 48-hour hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, issued a global call for a global strategy to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals will experience the discomfort of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the disease.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, isolation, fear of ill health, stress and poverty are all factors that are affecting people's lives in their lifetimes".
The disease can develop in a mild form with mild symptoms such as mild respiratory distress, such as a common cold.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, but those with more severe breast pain may take between three and six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women are at higher risk for infection with COVID-19 strains or related viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the spine and the spine.
In severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in respiratory failure, shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Acute hypertension, specifically prothrombin time elevation, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, but acute renal failure has been reported in 4% of the population.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show elevated levels of transaminases.
Based on the same report, the average time from onset to onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were in hospital.
Thus, patients referred to the ICU had a seven-day average time between admission and death.
In the first case study, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% compared to 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of liver samples from the deceased showed the spread of alveoli in the fibromyxoid cell exudates of both liver cells.
Changes in viral cytopathology were observed in the pneumocytes.
The mirror image is similar to the pain of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac failure was characterized by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
Based on March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations were pre-existing conditions. Medical resources and socioeconomic conditions of the patient may affect mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality from disease varied due to changes in the drugs, but also due to difficult methodology.
A simple reading of the case may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, since the deaths were caused by previously infected individuals, this may mean that the death rate of the latter is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to be in intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong General Hospital noted a 20% to 30% decrease in liver strength in patients who recovered from the disease, and liver scans showed organ damage.
It can also lead to post-traumatic stress disorder after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unclear whether a high dose could provide effective and long-lasting immunity to people who had recovered from the disease.
Immunity is considered to be possible, as is the case with other coronavirus strains, but cases of COVID-19 recoveries have been followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date than reported.
Such cases are believed to be a negative side effect of the disease rather than a new threat.
The virus is thought to be a natural and animal-derived virus, with a transmission of infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the prevalence of the disease is generally considered to be transmitted from person to person.
A study of 41 confirmed early COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, stated that the date of first onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first symptoms began on 8 December 2019.
Many months are spent on the number of people you have killed.
These rates vary widely and over time and are influenced by the prevalence of infections, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health of the individual.
In late 2019, the WHO issued ICD-10 emergency codes of U07.1 codes for laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for clinical or epidemiological COVID-19 cases without laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate from measles is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies from case to case. Some measures include the CFR, which represents the percentage of diagnosed cases that die from the disease, and the IFR, which represents the percentage of patients (diagnosed or undiagnosed) that die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound, but are based on a specific population from the infection rate to the end of the case.
Although not all people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people are at risk of developing the disease.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have recently died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread from Carnival celebrations, and was also found in young children, causing a small number of deaths and not all COVID-19 deaths were classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not suffering too much.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the total population) are confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics on mortality rates varies between men and women.
The male homicide rate is higher than that of all studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk increases for men by age 50, and the gap between men and women closes at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reason for the differences between males and females is not known, but it may be genetic or behavioral factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower cigarette use in males and increased risk of infection by conditions such as hypertension in younger than males may increase mortality rates in males.
In Europe, 57% of the cases were male and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government had not yet generated statistics on COVID-19 cases in buses or coaches.
Studies show that viral infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
An increasing percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are underserved, and therefore at increased risk for exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization confirmed on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 years for the first known outbreak: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid fingerprinting in a specific geographic area (e.g., China), specific animal species or population, in a series of international labels that were recommended for naming reasons that would reduce stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO has also recommended the use of "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public health communication.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to simply as "coronavirus".
At the time of the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were both referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV respiratory syndrome be included as the emergency names for the virus and disease following the 2015 recommendation to replace the disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
In addition to the standard medical device manufacturing process, some digital manufacturers are printing medical equipment such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve urgently, and its operator could not deliver it on time, a local company used reverse engineering and printed 100 required valves in one night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans have been shown to have a history of transmitting the virus from other animals.
The study failed to detect signs of viral transmission in pigs, ducks, and others.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International public consultations on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines are being conducted by government agencies, academic institutions and industry experts.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the " SOLIDARITE trial " to study the effects of the B-compound antiviral therapy that offers strong hope for cure.
A vaccine has not yet been developed, but several agencies are working to develop a vaccine that is safe.
The initial work on SARS-CoV was carried out in the context of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, researchers focus on developing a full-blown viral vaccine.
The use of such viruses, both active and passive, seeks to stimulate the immune response of the human body to the new strain of COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to develop vaccines that make the immune system more sensitive to the actual subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such detection focuses on the S-spicular proteins that allow the virus to bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for improving vaccination).
Vaccines tested using these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine was launched with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines do not contain the genetic code of the disease but are copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhanced potency has been suggested in the field of warfare as a possible development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this remains a matter of debate.
More than 300 clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials are investigating currently approved treatments for malaria, including four that are investigating hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs have been developed for a variety of reasons and are the focus of a total of nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in China, which will be conducted in several countries and reported by the end of April.
A clinical dynamics study of the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 with an approved vaccine is expected in April 2020.Many antiviral drugs already in development are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
The first positive test for remdesivir was in March 2020.
An increase in clinical well-being was observed in patients receiving remdesivir for trauma treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with initial publications.
However, there are hopes that scientists will unravel the mystery of memory.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology reports that when one dose of gamma is administered daily, two of those doses are considered to be highly toxic and potentially fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued a marketing authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the context of confidentiality for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.The 7th Chinese edition also added interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir to kill COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are important for the in vitro response to SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been proposed for further in vivo studies after demonstration of low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies suggest that the activation of the protein spectrum of the initiator by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for the activation of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Cloroquine studies with hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have severe limitations that may cause the pharmaceutical community to reject therapies without further study.Oseltamivir does not treat SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine seizure may be a serious symptom of the late stage of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-stimulating properties.Tocilizumab has been included in treatment regimens by the National Health Commission of China following the completion of a small study.
A nationwide phase 2 non-randomized trial is currently underway in Italy after positive results in patients with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests for the disease, it is designed to inhibit growth, which is thought to be the cause of death in a small percentage of patients.
The first investigational interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA following a series of studies initially conducted for the treatment of refractory steroidal cytokine withdrawal syndrome using a different target, CAR T-cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled trial to confirm that tocilizumab is a safe treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified antibodies and concentrations from the immune system of COVID-19 survivors to recipients is monitored for both vaccine-free and passive immunization.
Such a device has been tried but with little success.
Neutralization of the virus is a potential potential route by which passive antibody therapy could potentially mediate the protection of patients against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cytotoxicity and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis may be effective.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of machine-generated monoclonic antibodies, are being developed.
The serum concentration of patients who have recovered from the disease, which is a partial fluid sample from a recovered person and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased by differentiation by mutation.
Coronavirus outbreak, a collection of highly interrelated syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who was the first person to be diagnosed with COVID-19, died after improving his knowledge of the virus's spread.
