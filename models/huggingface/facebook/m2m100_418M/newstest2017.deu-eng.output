28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, who has recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairs of a local shopping center.
The victim’s brother said he couldn’t imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, “Finally it went up with him again.”
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a cook in Boston, had six months ago achieved his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Son & Daughter said that they were “shocked and destroyed on the ground” about his death.
“We’re a small team working like a close family and we’re going to miss him painfully,” the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and compassion are in this difficult time with Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in Hostels, but that, "the things finally went up for him."
“He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend,” Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a gentle man with a great heart.
His way to connect with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us for dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swim with the electricity.
“In everything that’s wrong in the world, he was that untouched diamond that shines light every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD notification phone at the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put into the boxes
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made it clear in an interview.
“I’m always placed in boxes or getting covered from outside labels that mostly have little to do with me and the reality.”
“I don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
“I’m honest, these things are more hard for me.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress preferred to spend her time at home, in front of television, with mild dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
To the White Glut, she brings the question of the desire for children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," the Hollywood star says.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's game" Aniston is seen as a single-born mother of two sons.
The film will run with us on August 25.
Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is clear.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a bit of shift with an exit on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: “Golden Sports Pyramid” for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they were hunting in the fast galopp home to the food tricks.
A mile at that pace, I was afraid.
“It was not a good experience,” Langer says.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses.
He allowed himself and his family to go through the facility of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even hunt himself for photographs.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid delivered the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in a small gala.
At the awards, the sympathetic athlete is not lacking.
Federal Merit Cross, Silvernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has admitted him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner, Hans Günter Winkler.
“This award means a lot to me,” Langer says, “because it will be awarded not only for sports success, but also for social engagement.”
For decades, Langer has been promoting the youth.
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double U.S. champion was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The distinguished include the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Rider Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Schockemöhle and the posthum of the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had arrived in Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved to Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize went.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's Economic Policy Comparison: It's All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are united in tax and energy policy as well as in a principle question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns of how the state can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump says.
It will massively reverse regulations, and it will make itself strong for a broad tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for.
Clinton, on the contrary, says that the state has to perform certain tasks, it has opportunities to open to disadvantaged, and it needs money to do so.
That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, he says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
In that need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost equally.
The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty fleet of the Republicans.
Therefore, there could be further internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and rebuild coal supply in the United States.
Oil promotion is also possible in so far protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the contrary, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program, calling for “a country to become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs.”
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America – I want us to be it.”
But not only in the infrastructure, but also in the international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade – but simply better protect U.S. jobs.
They should be paid better, according to Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says the minimum wage must rise, then he says he cannot be changed.
However, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to stimulate growth.
His critics admire him, so the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
Refugees: “Every woman has experience of sexual violence”
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen there are four women.
Each person has a baby that is up to one year old.
He put his little son in his arm.
He looks into the room with big eyes.
His mother looks at the table.
until she realizes that she is being observed.
She smiled and kissed the little boy.
The scene is normal.
Talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the sector manager of Condrobs, a provider for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and is engaged, among other things, in the issue of women on the escape.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
“It’s not exaggerated to say: Every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her escape,” says Bahr.
“People flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a source of hope,” she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape prevail: “Many secretly steal from it because they don’t see any other way out.”
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsory violence, honour murders, slavery or compulsory prostitution.
That drives them on.
In the escape it goes on.
“The fact that slopers, for example, require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rare thing,” says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that the end, once they come to Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.
Also here, single women in refugee accommodations would often be regarded as disadvantaged and abused in the worst case.
This leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
“Some of the children are not born voluntarily.”
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
“Or they don’t dare to speak openly about what is experienced, because the shame is too big.”
Since they often didn’t know how to help themselves, more accommodation is needed only for them, Bahr calls.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answered No.
In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken there is no such thing in the housing of the governments.
Even in Schwaben, single refugees women are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government spokesman.
In Oberbayern, under- and medium-sized industries, some community accommodations have floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Netherlands, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are hosted separately."
“If privacy is lacking or men and women are housed together, there may be – continuous – violence against women.”
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study says.
How much women feel this need for protection, you can read at the Andrang that is on the house in Munich.
“Since it has been discussed that we are there, we have a long waiting list,” says Bahr.
It could easily open a second house.
Assistant Doctors Strike: Requests for New Labour Struggle Measures
Deputies of the assistant physicians have called on their trade unions to approve new labour fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more work-based measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it would have denied the ministers to address concerns regarding the treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the election.
In a letter to members, which was posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "behaviorally calm" on issues, leading to the contract was rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to reject the proposed new treaty completely and called for official renewal of all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today has submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour action, which begins in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors strike six times this year, the first total cases in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms that were recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings that took place before the 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students voted that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced.
Russia and Turkey: A “coalition of foreigners”?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish opponent in the Golden Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can’t refuse the impression that Ankara most desires this reconciliation.
There was the handheld, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed shy and he hardly radiated heat, even for his retardating relationships.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I could not count it anymore.
He also promised that the relations with Russia will not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustainable cold that Putin raised showed that the head of state of Russia had nothing forgotten.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shutdown of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at that time was burned.
Putin dismissed and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater as it was committed by a suspected friend.
To rebuild the trust will be difficult, if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed like the Turks would be guilty of everything.
The most serious were the allegations of the officials that Erdogan’s own family would benefit from the illegal oil trade in the territories of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly disputed this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to record a sort of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly clear.
Erdogan is primarily in need of all the friends he can get after he was dismissed almost from his office in a failed strike last month.
Repeated terror attacks on Turkey also shocked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions harshed Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped by 90%.
In Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will be easier if the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm in the Mediterranean.
This week the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West as it sees its response to the attempted overtaking as a weak response.
This is the ongoing rumour about the shrinking pace of EU membership negotiations and Putin, who is pushing to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey’s relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for asking for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted strike.
This is obvious for Moscow, which has even a deep-sitting fear of regime change.
The summit in this glowing palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent one, as one analyst once described to me, “a alliance of foreigners”: two countries that are breached by the West and feel badly treated and now unite.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peace founder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be remarkable that after almost three hours of first talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not even broken the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common name for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when the NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is expected to be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the chairman of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has distanced since it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private customer business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour by customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the sensitivity of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we concentrate ourselves inside (we’ve asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the chairman.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can start these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori has won his 3,000th prize at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori springs champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him $3,000 winnings
On Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket.
He set on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second night win a mile.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey to reach the mile in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won before Ghayyar, said, “It’s something special.”
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It’s not a big meeting, it’s not a Royal Ascot – it’s a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the joy when he takes the victory on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best Jockey of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached this milepower that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it’s his tactical intelligence that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charism has excited fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie to Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have already earned 6,000 wins if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament hockey!
Frankie has been running winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible Jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the highlight of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glory Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug prohibition.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month closure, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to resist his doubts and return to his best form.
And he’s not over for a long time – Dettori has once said that he wants to continue competing until his at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Putin has shot Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unpredictablely released his head Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of Putin’s closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Commissioner for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a Kremlin statement it is said that Putin, without indicating reasons, “ordered Ivanov’s dismissal from his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy representative since 2012, was named his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website it is said (in Russian) that he was later the head of the protocol and head of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the main task of the government to support your activities as the head of state regarding draft laws and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are you convincing the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest trusts and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As head of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the staff chief resigned on his own wish.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here – especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows this at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - hit great skepticism.
In his comments to Putin, which will be quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said, “It’s true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to trust me these very complicated posts – you could almost say – challenging posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was former Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy representative.
When Putin arrived in power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another, nearby Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson Shot After Shooting Producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation last month at the series set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement its resignation.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
In the set there were artistic differences and discrepancies.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details on how the character of Gibson will be drawn out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios opinion is expected to be published at a later time.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with since the first season of the series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and I’ve infested all my heart blood in the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans that one can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery of the fish that landed in the garden in Banff
Residents of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish could be sandals sprinkled by a spring fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the show on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct – meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fife.
It’s the first of four closures of the “cover shadows” that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 scraps.
The $1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economist Keith Brown held a visit to the building today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a weak activity that requires extremely precise tolerance for the fit.
In total, almost 79 percent of the entire bridge deck is on their place and the last part of the roof is now in Rosyth with a concrete push for the roof, which means that the entire roof is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high and deep construction.
After the last road cover section was installed and its connection to the North Tower cover that was under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern Zubringer Bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very weak activity.
Massive, as the Viadukt is 222 meters long, weighs approximately 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up with a climb of approximately 3%.
Heikel, as the tolerance on which the team worked was small - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three Men Have "Happiness To Be Alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station shot Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the incident in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on their own.
“We saw the boat turning around them and imagined the worst,” said the head of the Moelfre rescue station, Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, the strong winds have swallowed the boat out of its reach until we left the water,” he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fisherman boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boje without a rescue wall.
They all arrived on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, “The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness not injured and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop point, but it was dissolved by the person who controlled the boat when the boat was stuck.
Someone has awakened these men today.
He was seriously injured, a man struck his ex-girlfriend.
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and wounded heavily.
As the police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal stuff.
Instead, the alcoholic murderer cut off his ex-girlfriend’s clothes.
When she arrived in the apartment, he struck her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the murderer.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
He then alarmed his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn’t push him to leave the apartment.
That’s why she left the house with her companion.
On the road they met the ex-friend of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who Build Braunschweig's Cheap Apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken much stronger into their obligations in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose 1,300 cheap homes in the coming years?
The SPD proposes for the next meeting a “action concept Living”.
The dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD party chairman Christoph Bratmann said: “We agree with the Greens: Whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to represent 20 percent of all houses as social houses.”
However, affordable houses can also be created in stock.
However, the big point of dispute in the council is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the houses as social houses on such areas.”
A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: “There is no agreement between the factions at the moment.”
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
The Left wants strict requirements for investors.
However, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is worsening.
If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
However, the program is not yet complete: for the approximately 1260 new houses, which should be built anyway.
But how can we compare the loss of more than 1,300 affordable houses, which will be promoted in the coming years?
Only by 2020 there will be 500 houses.
To prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm said, now outgoing bonds should be purchased from the city.
It should also be considered to bring apartments back to the price bond.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem can be solved by one blow.
There are deadlines for the end of the year in the West.
Around 1,800 apartments could be returned to the price bond for affordable apartments.
This is not what the owners, the housing companies do not want.
Because the number of social homes in the western city is drastically increasing again, you are away from the target of the so-called intersection.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens are hoping that there will be further movement in the discussion.
The party’s chairman Holger Herlitschke said: “For a large majority, the CDU must bring it to the boat.”
It has focused on more buildings for single-family houses.
But that does not mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time watching screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about bringing people out of the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was first limited to the TV, then to video games and lastly to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I, of course, refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (this later created a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).
As many phenomena of pop culture fell interest before the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July somewhat.
Market introduction in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are traced with a GPS and once they have been found, they can be “photographed” (through a screenshot on the phone) or “captured”.
A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the “medium” person slows down every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of traced people who tracks 30 minutes every day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go – it’s just seeing the raw data for performance improvement.
Many public health awareness campaigns that make people want to "take their 30 minutes of time," "to come out of the sofa" and "to be active every day" hit the blind ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look ugly.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to bring them here.
But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunlight, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendship on hunting.
As always, there are also myric gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What should it be?
There was a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they didn’t give us any reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new will lose its excitement and the use will decrease with time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit, and healthier.

Simone Biles Creates Gold in the Dament Tower
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
Difficult on the balcony.
Amazing breathing on the ground.
Overall brilliant.
And finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American tournament wins to the multiplayer title on Thursday and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the light of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team companion Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the swing ball during the women's single-match tournament in the art tournament at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fighting title and the total fifth while strengthening her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport in the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tournamentist I've ever seen."
It waited for her a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn’t go so much between the balls and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of overdimensional expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman kiss after winning gold and silver each in the women's single-match finals in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles received the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a calling sign at the farewell party of the retirement team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that during his long journey to the top, he never planned the future, that’s not really true.
Some of their ground exercises – which include their typical Tumbling Pass – are adapted to Latin American music, which would fit home on the street outside the Olympia Arena in Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament hall where Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost any more multi-competition since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina was easily driven through two turns, the picture was drawn.
Swimbalks and ground turns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - scattered.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swing ball and put another one on the ground with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman kissed her gently as they expected her end - a pure formality - and tears flowed on the balls brightly red, white and blue eyelines, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went in a deepbrake to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called “Oma” by the Americans, had an advance.
After her ground practice, she threw to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three people killed in serial killing while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first serial murder in Phoenix while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The murderer shot eight shots from a hand-fire weapon while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report says.
Police that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Overall, mainly in Hispanic residents, seven people were killed and two others were injured in nine attacks within four months.
“It’s happening in a living area in front of a house,” Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah are still dying on the site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup pressure half an hour before the triple murder and is supposed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found patron hole and saved a ball from the seat as well as ball parts from the motor room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But like the few of his elderly cousins, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know anything during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was I couldn’t do it.
I can’t do that.
I have not allowed myself to do that.
What’s not right at all – of course, you’ve made it,” she said.
His husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund could never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalize it.
"My first answer to it was 'I didn't know that people still do,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can run with the help of a help.
Edmund was not able to sit or crabble until his third year of life, and he was still unable to speak.
But he progresses slowly.
He can run with support and ride a bicycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund has invented for "Please sing me something."
“We’re bringing him character language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it’s not a typical character language – she says. – Edmund has invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as maser or cycavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary considerably.
It’s still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly wonder what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn’t really know it.
I have not been asking for the forecast for a long time, because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the zika virus.
It will be better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency state on Friday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand bags were increasing.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa municipality alone would have requested ten thousand sand bags.
A flood warning system will be used across large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service suggested that additional 3-5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday, while the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the frontal near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stream-down-directed flood in Ascension Parish is a danger as these will only slowly flow through the twisted rivers into the Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9 p.m.
Rescue teams were still pushing people out of the flood in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son were among those who were saved on Friday near the monastery.
Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another Stiefson who lives nearby had warned him.
“We were awake and the water flowed and flowed into,” Hansford said.
It reached my size.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a river rise.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the nearest firefighter in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "expanded quickly" as there were still severe rainfall and that the authorities are considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone rain from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said the ground was significantly filled by the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities that severe rains and road floods caused residents to be rescued from their houses in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL that an associate attacked 200 flooded houses in Tangipahoa.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which are now both flooded.
The council chairman, Robby Miller, said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were drowned by the flood.
In the cities Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the evacuated.
“When the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond of the town of Tangipahoa, two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants hoping to be able to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last big flood we had was in March,” said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said that rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were to have overflowed on Thursday, but no reports were on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” said Townson, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, survived by shooting in Philadelphia
The police that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a six-year-old boy is shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents that Brown suffered several shooting injuries, including in the ligament, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.
“He has passed through a lot, his small body was scattered by balls,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the radio.
I just can’t believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy’s family told the radio that he is expected to be healed again.
He had to start the first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people killed in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, the radio.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are just investigating whether among one of the injured men of the murderer could be.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several guards.
Patron houses for storm weapons, which were traced back to various storm weapons, ignore the place of the incident.
It seems that it was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were holes.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very actively involved here," police officer Anthony Ginaldi told Philadelphia police.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently reviewing the video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was hit by a crush on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residence of the West Oak Lane.
She recovered and the police are still searching for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine in the women’s Olympic team in the tournament and that’s for more than one reason.
First, I have participated in every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team has three tourners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, which covers Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has fixed the black and Spanish female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the women’s tournament was an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
During the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America joined.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but mastery gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the peak of this sport, but this is how tournament classes throughout the country don’t look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tourners in the team.
But the reality seems that tournaments are a expensive sport and tournaments are primarily in private tournaments held by parents who pay for the training, facility, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these turnups are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the tourners receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to provide countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, with a more efficient and accessible tournament training.
I have founded my tourism foundation for 20 years.
At my events we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Tournaments develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real performance of "Girl Power" by taking the Olympic team gold and thank you for getting her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start her way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in a election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS was in a "no country" and any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract, which will include changes to night and weekend work to improve care at untouchable times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors said last night in a statement: “Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heal the current employment crisis and it will fail to treat all doctors fairly.”
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and the time goes out.
The efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks hit the government on refusal to participate and sometimes on ear-thinking silence.
This happened from a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt has to act now, remove the compulsion and address the concerns of the assistant doctors.”
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labor struggle measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a breakdown of 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates as nurses and specialists were engaged to provide doctors coverage on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chief Executive Officer of NHS employees, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Working measures nothing of the little but already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, nurses and their families only to worry, need and interruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and have responded positively to the concerns with regard to leadership and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a career leave, training fees, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing leave and gender-specific wages in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after it was recommended by the authorities to give this more people for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The regulatory authority NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year take to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The regulatory authority NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year take to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fat-containing materials in the arterial walls that form clots.
If the coating breaks down, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood flow and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The guidance draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a two-time daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a recurring heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
The culture of Political Correctness causes electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the grounds of a government report for corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being consciously ignored as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has verbally attacked the police, electoral observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to "supersensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that it should be permitted to the police to set banners outside of electoral cabins to protect scared voters.
He recommends that voters carry a passport to prove their identity in the election.
Currently, a voter must only indicate his name and address.
The report suggests not to put removable tint on a person's finger when they give their voting to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls on the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
“This not only serves against electoral fraud, but it also aims to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litanium of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had “perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way” and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.
Rahman said he "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a repentance in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he expressed an alarm about the fraudulent letter election - in which elderly members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including conducting evidence to prove identity
The report says: “As proof it was appropriate that pressure was exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh background.
“There were concerns that... state institutions would have consciously ignored such behavior due to ‘politically correct’ over-sensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists to edit post-election documents in order to stop "Wahlernten".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing for your passport.
Do not use removable tint on a person's finger as soon as he has given his voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To conduct systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic mail selection.
It is prohibited that political activists edit full letter elections and reverses of letter elections.
The police are authorised to establish blocks on electoral stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates an allegation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983)
Photographers are banned in electoral stations.
Request that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees comply with the rule that voters go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no punishment announcement.
“The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy representative inadmissible due to a litanium of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
He was declared guilty for a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective “abhack controls” of the electoral registration departments of the Rathäuser.
Sir Eric said: “The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud inheritance, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy to Kates Radler's double-goer and other famous double-goer from Olympic athletes in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week have gone out of line about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be the impressive double-walker of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionikin this summer is far from the only gold-fighting athlete who has his own famous double-goers - at least not if you can give faith to social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently floating on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic championships that have more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood famous faces.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in the shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kat's double-walk on the railroad, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain bow protector could be the Twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appeared.
In fact, the godguard received the madness on social media and admitted that he has been heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
“I myself see no big similarity, except the face hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a good guy, so I’m sure I’ll take it as a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more focused this year: the enormous similarity between the British broadband Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian tourist Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes will be able to go through as a double runner for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor.
Another continuous comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian Silver Medal Swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sunshine skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to be similar to a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the similarities as well
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
One Twitter user declared his satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner of the tournament Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, which is similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "was dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free swimming season annoyed viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "seared like a mice" and during the race "seared like a pig."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming season.
MacDonald, who was picked up to the CBS commentary team on board to give more "colour", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her attachment, baby."
Too excited, went out like a mole, died like a pig.
Thank you for it.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second stage of the swimming season 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap to China.
Guests across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "The CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "as a pig died"????
The fool didn’t realize that they were still on the show.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m free-cylinder swimming season for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the attachment, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, and many discussed him.
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologize for the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unhappily chosen formulation, we’re sorry that it happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to the people who answered the comment via Twitter
The commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our spectators on the show and our followers on social media yesterday night.
To clarify one, Byron’s comments referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and a unhappily chosen formulation.Byron makes what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment by stating that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming season at the CBC Olympic show," he said.
“I refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.”
Of course, no neglect was intended and I’m sorry.”
Buyers in Primark annoy about a woman who is trying in the middle of the store shy underwear
The buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underhouses.
To make the situation worse, she patterned how she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back into the plate.
They went on and tried four pairs of underhouses in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underhouses before she put them back into the roof
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she looked back and left the store without buying anything."
She said, “People couldn’t believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the sale area, she took a couple of underhouses out of the exhibition, pulled out her own stripes and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, shy like Oskar."
“Everyone watched when she pulled out the underhouses, which she obviously didn’t like, as she put them back into the plate.”
She repeated the same with three other underhouses before she finally decided that she didn’t like to look back and go out.
"She didn't seem to disturb that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the underhouses she had tried."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How angry to think that someone would take home underhouses that had a different person and that were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "As I learned, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is equally good."
“I’d hate to go home with a new pair of underhouses and find out that another woman hugged them and pulled them out again and they were not washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were pulled out of sale.
How to Protect Yourself With Krav Maga From Weapon Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed thieves at close distance.
Whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the spike for your thief.
If you get closer from the back, then you should turn yourself first so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Take the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it in the face with your free eggs.
Then hit him with the knees into the slope and throw the weapon out of his hands while the attacker crumbles from pain. Throw him with the run into the face and move back while they target the weapon on him.
In the attackers that approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then drain the weapon out of his hand before they move backwards and target the weapon on him.
It sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is.
But remember that in the case of a robbery, it's the safest to transfer your money - unless you're not Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright Creates His Language for a Guide to the Most Dirty Places in Europe
A British traveler was subjected to a serious examination of his immune system and wortel reflex - by removing some of the most dirty and ugly places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scratched his hand on a euro bill, a terrace at the Piccadilly Circus, a drop button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before covering each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to do.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of removing the washing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rebellious, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen powder.
During his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left what he dropped, more than a bad post-smack in the mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public land on railway stations to washing buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film, he told me, “As a child, I was relatively unconscious about my health and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms, and slam water.”
In the film, he was definitely honoured with his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sampling showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of fresh washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to turn off after its luminous number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands had one of less than 60 units.
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, “This comes close to the worst thing I’ve smoked in a toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than that.
I’m not going to see anything here because it’s ugly inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company hosts Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended with saying, “Let us call Ian.”
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let's tell me this way - I'd have lost my respect for Ian if he had covered some of the things I told him to leak, like the ugly Russian toilet that's shown in the film."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to touch her and others in which it was quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve recorded some of these dirty tastes on the movie.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84% of all respondents associated milk acid bacteria especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58% said they used at least occasionally products that contain added milk acid bacteria.
Social Family Destroyed Before Delogation Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A associate family left her social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown off after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked residential association employees found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed cracking holes, wooden parts were cut off, waste was spread on the floor and graffiti was smelled to the walls.
The family was displaced and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation.
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably not be considered as such a beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is famous and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police said the terror that the family had added included street struggles with baseball strangers, residents' intimidation, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive crying, disputes and curse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be destroyed, old waste was found.
In the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden parts were cut off.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be regularly called to the police.
Cornwall Housing violently delogated her and her partner from the property this week after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
The delogation was admired by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One said, “They didn’t worry about anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
“Today morning we couldn’t sleep.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that you are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said it would have dismissed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called regularly for 20 years.
On the overwhelmed side of the municipality house, waste and old toys were thrown down.
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant refused to take any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have courageously reached us and made the information available to us, have done.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging on the ground
House management workers will now have to remove waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a Razzia in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as weapons, paraphernals and cash in the amount of £1,700.
Skeldon was sentenced to a fine after claiming to be guilty of possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a grave of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were decorated with graphiti.
Police say they will delogate tenants who do not adhere to the house order
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not adhere to the house order.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusation as well as those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal Panic After a Deep Military Jet Flies Over the Beach
Sunrise in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force launched an incredible landing flight
The air force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when scared tourists began to panic after a deep jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic videos showed how the military aircraft flighted almost near the sunrise on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The travellers jumped up when they understoodly began to worry about the noise of the dust power plants, without first seeing what came through the clouds on them.
The incident occurred last night in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many travellers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: "It really flown very deep twice and there was a moment it looked like it would collapse."
Nuno Arroja added, “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of darkness and flown incredibly deep.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The spokesman said the jet was flying a little deeper than usual due to the poor sight by the nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that security was not in danger at any time.
Earthquakes have destroyed parts of the Portuguese continent this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the circumstances - strong clouds and storms - which restricted his vision.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify Fischerboats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca is worried about Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is struggling on Sunday for the first step to win the title in the new football season.
The Catalanes are playing in the duel around the Spanish Super Cup outward against FC Sevilla, the reversal game rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must give up, among others, Neymar, who disputes the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, with the lower Cup finalist and ruling European League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German has suffered a band growth in the knees during the training, which has cleared the question at Barca at least for now in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been betting in Barcelona for the status of number one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique gave up a clear decision in this regard so far and left Bravo in the league, but for that Ter Stegen appeared in most other candidates.
Before the first compulsory game of the new game time, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was demolished with 0:4 in a Liverpool test game on Saturday.
Even at 3:2 in the trial match against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
Seville again has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and seeks the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with 11 successes.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated on Thursday in a unilateral final in Rio de Janeiro his landman and "Title Defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4).
Thus, the world ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes in the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have succeeded in the final match as expected and made the title to each other.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia trap was the former SVS-NÖ legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had moved back to the tribes and left their defenders alone in fair competition.
“The matches I have played for my country.”
“In the final I’m playing for myself,” Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medals winners positioned with the Chinese fan.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma had to really fight with her 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough amazing ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-finals against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the White Russian had suffered a ripe injury, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" satisfy himself with a blade.
By the way, the Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) were in the similar high table tennis age Olympia fourth.
Donald Trump launches “gigant problems” in the election campaign
The U.S. Republicans’ leadership is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, to insert their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted the weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the generally widespread and self-confident multi-millionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the Battle for the White House are growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump said to evangelical Christians, whom he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
The fault was false reports about his candidature, he again took up his well-known media shells.
The Republican Highlands
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were similar.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also in danger.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he would like to stop Clinton’s advance again: “As I’ve done so far.”
And go back: "This will either be successful, or I'm going to make a very nice, long holiday."
He does nothing but “to tell the truth.”
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, it’s okay,” Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party said Trump threatened to waste funds to support his election campaign if he could not present better survey values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress would be stronger under their arms.
Olympia: Triple Fraud in Doping Test
The IOC plans to establish a disciplinary committee on this issue.
Kenya's light athletes are threatened after the second doping case at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter merchant Ferguson Rotich.
This was to the Kenya team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case to pursue its own investigations, IAAF spokesman said.
“Based on the results of the investigation and the follow-up measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment,” the IAAF said in a statement.
“He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has given himself as a Ferguson Rotich, given the sample and signed it,” Kenia’s chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was the world championship quarter in 2015 in Beijing over 800 meters.
Four days ago, Kenya's light athletic delegation chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He has informed the athletes of his country about the upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been observed by the IOC for a long time after numerous doping crimes.
In the announcement of the more than 2,000 doping targets set by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to be previously noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into vision.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics began.
Following this, the WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping control is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's light athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A series of ARD television reports have repeatedly raised accusations that in Kenya doping drugs are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed it in Russian light athletics.
In this case, it was proven that in this sport was plainly covered and systematically doped.
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's Year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.
This is a surprise of Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classics and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral grave the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swears.
We always say that it is very Latin-American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this screenplay, Bartoli plays an elderly Mary.
She reminds herself of her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
Because it is musically extraordinary.
And then there would be Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course also naive, and very passionate.
“She looks very much like me, my Italian character I have as a Roman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is an honor for us to work with her.
She is an incredibly generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Guiding is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of your movements, in your eyes, it is your life!
It is a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the West Side Story is very up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Rican have gone to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join ISIS, has died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's bowl building in the country, ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she planned to leave the war-made country and return to England, according to her family.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the east of London landed in a plane toward Turkey and then in a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was to have married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of a election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokesman for Reid later said he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculates.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, they were Lakaien and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is inappropriate for the presidency.
Treats Wants Naked Calendar for "Women and For Men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
Treats' chief editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from Oldschool playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
It seems that he believes that the calendar does it as well.
“We have to return to the representation of timeless and classic nakedness, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release to the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
“Who doesn’t fit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed bags,” says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of seekers of protection to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community Germany is expecting a mass escape to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand seekers of protection from Turkey in Germany, if Erdogan’s regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” Ali Toprak, the leader of the association, said on Friday.
Since the government has already overturned Kurdish Highlands months ago with criminal actions, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are fleeing.
After the overwhelming coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that receives refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevian cities.
Thus, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or dispersed in the last hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association called for the federal government to "position as sharp as Austria is against Erdogan and his supporters."
In Germany, there is a “heksy hunt” against Erdogan’s critics.
For the first time in the last few months, I feel no longer safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen adherent destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
“Those who don’t adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed bags, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the “World”.
According to the newspaper, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks had already before the coup the largest group of asylum persons recognized for political persecution in Germany.
By June 30th, there were 11,386 people, which accounted for almost 29 percent of all asylum entitled (39,625).
In this survey, there are no prisoners before war, poverty or prospective.
Asylum rights according to the basic law are exclusively politically, i.e. by the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: “Dahin go where it hurt”
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.
The national elections in 2021 will not take place immediately at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwarzenegger Parliament has already decided earlier this year.
For more foolish than ever can’t be: summer holidays, heat and countryside elections – that bite.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the voters are on vacation.
Most of the tourists who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the land day.
This comes with practical problems: In the holidays, assistants who hang posters, blow air ballons, distribute flyers, and at the end count the voices, are just hard to throw up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again allow the election campaign to pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, the leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.
It will be exciting how strongly Neuling AfD cuts down and what remains coalition-stable at the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of the government, is doing a almost unknown election campaign, you can see from his big posters.
He travels through the land, distributes roses and plays a little with the people, just as his legendary speaking predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold legs and blames Chancellor Merkel for the flower of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their “We make it” has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU and its top candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, have already experienced how it is when making election campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to a large consultation; Merkel's Bundestag election circle is located in the north-east.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
“There was probably the majority from other federal countries,” complained Vincent Kokert, CDU Secretary General in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it’s not unfortunate for anyone from other corners of Germany to hear Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-Eastern CDU largely leaves the usual campaign stations on market spaces and in front of shopping centers with sunshines and air ballons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a “subordinate role.”
The Union has also noticed that it is dismantling the base on the ground, that it has to make a lot of effort to find a way back to the people.
You go like the left, the SPD, the greens: they are hardly present in the widespread of the country.
The council of the CDU voter Kokert to his counterparts, however, is also self-interpreting: “You have to go where it hurt, namely where people are: village holidays, gold weddings, every birthday party must be used.”
Because a lot is on the game, Sellering has now called for his SPD to a committed election campaign.
In the survey, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind the partner CDU (25) and just a little ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD was still clearly winning with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, are likely to make the jump in the countryside.
They make the holiday not a modern virtue and make their election campaign greatly in the internet.
"Online election struggle," the country's president Claudia Müller said.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters go to search for traces for local voters among the vacationers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just turns through the Mecklenburg Lakes with a house boat and finds it still beautiful.
Their impression: “Voting holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment.”
B27 sanitation: hostels suffer from blockade
The speed with which the B27 is recovered has nothing to do.
For the managers of the construction work, which starts at 5:30 a.m. and ends only at 20 a.m., there is a half praise.
“They’ve done everything quite crazy,” says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tank station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The building could be planned to move to the south at the beginning of the week for half time, and until the end of October everything is planned to be finished.
The arrival of the responsible for the construction works is also praised, for example when it comes to the installation of container routes.
Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been repealed and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has restored, the traffic situation within the site has relaxed.
The citizens are now able to run off from the B27 things again.
Traffic through the site seems to go back.
“There were partly significant complaints,” says the deputy chief executive officer, Florian King, responsible for the Traffic Engineering Management of the Renewal.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many were searching for sliding roads and more familiar with their navi than the painting.
This led to the fact that some trucks broke down in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality strongly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
“There were significant excesses,” King says, who once made himself aware of the situation.
It was two to three per minute.
The fastest was at 77 km/h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the building has been moved, it has become more quiet.
For the businessmen at the B-27, it is only a small comfort that for Rottenburg customers the road is now open again.
Business people don’t like to look at the maps.
But that the B27 sanitation has led to transit breakdowns in them, let everyone who is asked go through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", that is, produce for other companies, for whom the repair has hardly consequences.
Also at the Maier Car House, Thomas Sulz speaks of a “highest light decline”, but also explains that, of course, “the run customer is missing.”
The most striking are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, the owner of the steakhouse, before the crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat of existence.
Not only him, but all hosts have hit it hard.
There were missing customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We have to be happy over every euro turnover.
He refers to the amounts to “more than 50 percent.”
The road sanitation department has resigned its operation “in two years.”
Half of his employees had to be dismissed.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been dismissed, the policy would have responded differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt answered a question from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, indicating that the hostel would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27.
Göhner knows of other countryside where such a little more generously handled.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his hostel will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other tribal guests now pass less frequently due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can’t get there, it’s nice elsewhere.
That his tribal client will return after the restructuring works, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27-building work on his customers as the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in his long history.
Six months of work, that’s brutal.
The law is constantly drawn up in the name of terrorism.
After the recent attacks, the Interior Minister de Maizière is presenting a thick security package.
But what does a patience status have to do with terror?
What does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Consoler.
All his proposals are "politically justifiable" to the coalition partner, the Federal Interior Minister said in the presentation of his new security package.
They do not exaggerate anyone.
Other, further issues would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in it.
But as the Minister of the Interior, he is at the outcome and at a “objective consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière left a bit of time before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But now they fall even more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, alleged: that a new security authority will take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
It is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
Partly, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals that had not been to do with the SPD so far: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to remove the German passport from jihadists with double citizenship.
“These will be difficult points for the SPD,” the CDU man says.
However, he considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance at all.
A few new ideas de Maizière also introduces.
They have it partly in themselves: He plans quick procedures for expulsions and more ways to arrest people before expulsions.
Refugees who are targeted in the country must check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for security checks.
In the case of claims for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw out their papers to hide their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally weak.
Sometimes it seems untouched and leaves questions open.
And at some points – for example, in the inequality of patience – the question is: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, De Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it is not possible to argue that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, many people were concerned about security due to the high number of refugees.
And things that people deeply engaged were not allowed to go out even during the election campaign.
Internal security is very focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election struggles.
Therefore, the Union and the SPD are increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, the relationship between the two parties has increased.
First a striking dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security-political idea-collection of some Union Ministers, in which the resource leaders also demand a burka ban and a withdrawal from the double citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for reconciling sounds here.
He doesn’t care about a double pass.
We liberated the discussion in Germany.
Opening it is not meaningful.
And with a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually “reasonable” to the coalition partner, it is still to be revealed.
There is a lot in it that could cause dispute.
However, the SPD is also trying to profil itself on the issue of internal security.
Chairman of the party, Sigmar Gabriel, first pointed out cautiously prepared for talks and said: "SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further enhancing security."
Volkswagen is still moving forward.
Despite diesel scandals, exports are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets it goes round.
In the recovery there is a turmoil about a term.
Volkswagen starts its sales in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest motorcycle manufacturer can continue to show a plus over the course of the year, despite the diesel business, thanks to its many brands and some well-functioning markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sales, the company noted in the Dax said.
Worldwide, the brand VW sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, after China, the second-largest market, sales were 14 percent lower than last month.
In the domestic market in Germany, the expenditure has dropped by a sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, some core markets have been restricted to purchase due to “changed economic conditions”.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the UK’s vote on the withdrawal from the EU has also burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the emission deal first escalated, there is also a minor to be booked.
The main support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony continues to be glimpse by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a minus of delivery from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to show a sales plus from January to July.
In that time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software waste test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million vehicles to be equipped in the workshops.
During the rebuilding, VW confirmed that the rebuilding of the cars has no negative effects.
After the rearmament of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance.
The car manufacturer gives the customer a “garantial” certificate after the rearmament, but does not speak of a “garantial” as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal subtles.
The "Focus" had that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for re-equipped diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting was held.
“VW has to fully meet the requirements of my investigation committee and the KBA.”
“Abstinences from this are not accepted,” Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after rearming will occur and that all vehicle type-approval values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term “garantie” as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "garantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, a half year after the rearmament come to an atelier with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the emissions scandal will result in uncertainty regarding possible warranty arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term “garantie”.
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands from wealthy savings interest in the future – as the second institution in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: “It’s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts.”
The Federal Federation of German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see any sign in it: Normal Savers should “do not be afraid to pay for their savings.”
Depositing banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent fine rate.
This fee will be refunded by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from private and corporate customers from September for deposits over €100,000 on giro or daily cash accounts.
“The first 100,000 euros are free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
For a long time, he has taken care of 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit.
“They are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs,” the head of the bank said.
“I can’t pay for every million 4,000 euros.”
The cost continues according to the causer principle.
Just leaving the cash in the treasures of the Raiffeisenbank would be too dangerous: “I’ve already experienced four crashes, I don’t want the fifth!”
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few people went to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs for all banks.”
To carry them alone is “operative economically not permanently possible.”
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With penal interest rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made signs with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: “We don’t expect private customers to pay large-scale fees for deposits, for this the competition in Germany among banks and deposits is too strong.”
One banker said that there is "a client that is equipped a little more well with the wealth."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if it keeps money for free.
Founded in 1911, the Gmund Cooperation Bank has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
There are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs in the region.
The association “is currently unknown to any other banks that calculate a spending compensation for private customers’ deposits,” Ernst said.
The President of the Federal Federation of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is harsh, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
Consumers in Germany will not like this.
Destination Plates: Who Really Buyes Sound Plates?
Solitary men of the middle age love discs.
Before you rush to the comment section to ignore it under the pseudonym Not AllSomeMenMiddle Ages with cruel offenses, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the multiplied resurrection of sound plates is not due to a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It’s also not horden through hobbies – it has an emotional significance: older discs buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56 % vs. 53 %) and enjoy spending time alone (69 % vs. 66 %).
But are the results of YouGov right?
If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray dress and wild styling before I stand, hold my hands and say something determining like: "So let us take a closer look at it."
So let us take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly swallowing into its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were settled – there is still a handful of fantastic plate special stores.
I’d probably ask the camera man to turn off the camera for the next part, where I’m close to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men of the middle age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men of the middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I wonder?
“I appreciate it,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These soundtracks, depicted above (he sent me the shot by e-mail, I didn’t follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy albums that he couldn’t afford when they appeared and again buy items that he sold when he was young and crazy.
"Many of the things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy discs are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my loader.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets fit to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hape, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves forced to buy their old plates again.
From the conversations I’ve conducted, people have usually dissolved around 1998 or 1999 their collection.
“Customers who once sold their disks to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their disks again,” he says.
This would explain the boom to the supporters of the disc revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of discs?
It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that platforms offer a calming community of equally-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the elderly customers took an impulse to the contactless payment system.
Some plates fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar plates, of objects that call for happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a vacuum or possessing material property as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It is a simple way to engage mentally.
“We’re like their social workers!” a worker flows out of a plate.
A ICM survey in April revealed that 50% of people who bought a plate last month have not yet heard of it.
The survey also found that 41% have a platform player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a platform don’t have a platform player.
At this time of the news report I’d probably look very worried while I’m browsing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of the middle age), has noticed a "trophene view" of the Revival.
“Someone came here just recently and said, ‘I don’t have a plate player, but I’d like to buy a radiohead soundboard so I can put it in the plate,’ he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it happens definitely.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a plate player.”
These are younger people, not older people, who come slowly.
Fopp, which has dedicated the soundboard almost a whole floor, has a more colourful audience than I go.
There are couples around the 70s, tourists who take photos, teenagers and women of the middle age.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz pulled out of the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity among customers.
No one of them looks extremely lonely, but narrow mental trauma is difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of discs for sale.
It’s more likely to make a shower butter than a big purchase.
It doesn’t deserve a lot, so collecting discs is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of discs is...” she pulls out with a loving sweater.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of platinum lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I show the appearance of patterning the jeans hotpants, I watched a group of young teen girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley plate player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - because they’re just purely decorative, some so far up that it’s impossible to fit them.
It is pure “plate art.”
But considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury objects such as discs.
Although my research has shown that the results of YouGov are true, they leave, at least in platform shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and platform lovers that exist in reality, platform shops and on-line forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They will surely not spend their Thursday morning with the bullshit through the Berwick Street plate shops and the bullshit through the plates, while they avoid the sighting look of an unclean, 30-year-old false moderator, who asks on the shoulders of the unknown men of the middle age.
The Greenland Hai is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland Hai has the longest life span of all the vertebrae on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, the sharp investigator, says that the record was at a woman that is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal for abolition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to destroy dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to establish 72 provisional shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairstyles services or tea for 50 cents (40 pences) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which poses a fire and sanitary risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional shops, but ruled that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the departure was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which operates in a non-profit manner and offers 200 meals per day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure "will be a catastrophe for these children, the youngest of which are eight years old."
The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to date - after a sharp increase in newly arriving people during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic Time Race, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to let himself undercover.
“I keep the world championship in sight, stay confident and continue to fight,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the Sugar Hat.
“I think it’s hard to comment on the time of yesterday,” Martin said.
He must in peace analyze what reasons would have led to the debate.
At the October World Cup in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we have changed in the past time.”
"This is also my position," the three-time time race world champion wrote, who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the 54.5 km to the Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Swiss).
Olympia: Tennis professional wins and loses half-finals
Laura Siegemund's triumph ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The World Rankings 32 from Metzingen lost by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
The semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament are clear.
Victory, who was plagued by back problems, was able to pass through her rally only once and acted powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Medal Hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance to jump into the proposal round.
The Australian Open winner met with the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of the Summer Games had last been in 1992.
Never before a German duo stood in an Olympic single-half-final.
The group increases in the start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge focus – Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group is buying the start-up Beam, which has specialized in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not report on Thursday.
Beam started with its offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others when you play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up the players missions and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment items.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the growing world of eSports.
In the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already waiting.
The employees of the startup, which has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam’s co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi said.
Therefore, there is nothing to change for customers through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Popular platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by the online trader Amazon - for a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google’s mother Alphabet.
Here is the Enforcement Trailer.
German rays must adapt to the next generation speed meter: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer temposunters especially effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accidents points where it would be too dangerous for a police mobile measurement.
For example, on highway buildings or to repair bridges with a temporary temperature limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or overwhelming.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: its battery lasts five days in uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be captured simultaneously through multiple traces.
Variable speed limits as well as interdictions on time, tracks and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-driving state, you can move the attachment, according to the manufacturer, with any car with attachment cover.
In order not to be simply stolen, it is reduced in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the panced and, by the way, also shot-safe outer hole.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal countries and is now also used.
Foreign authorities also blink with the new technology: Recently, France has ordered 100 pieces, after a order of 150 pieces last year.
Britain gets silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji gets Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of Britain in the 7th Rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt stop at the last barrier in the form of the Fijis, when they were hit with a score of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, retreat, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was swept by the not so bad comfort prize of the silver medal - the UK's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boxers, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fijis chief coach Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind it.
Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one.
This slope will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and laid the attacks of GBs out of fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. felt as if you were running in riding buses. The World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Colinisau dropped in the corner.
With a four-minute game time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A thrilling tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua flew a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the reboot and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and jumped to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
So is it too.
GB carried out fundamental changes in the half-time and closed the Fiji gap for all four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions until Josua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea insulans, whose fans sang, flags swing and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.
Mata Viliame set the i-tube with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff swallowed, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked devastatingly hit in the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-finals out of the race - Britain's conversion of difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and reached a goal below the positions in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, guaranteed the win – and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired by fighting the coach’s cancer to win the round
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games, and that’s what they want to say.
From the first rally to the last, 220 hard hieve that entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all-present when they ran for the second Olympic gold in two without tax wives in a row, the first women in the history of the British sport to put such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, however, her 39th unprecedented commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes sliding over the surface with the elegance of tears, which does not reflect the kind of triumph at all.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the increasing progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did that.
If you don’t do that, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the perspective a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
This is how it begins.
Running in itself is already a challenge, but it makes it even greater.
In the immediate victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking about something more than anything else and trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wrath this week.
It only repeats how much it means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thanks goes to him.
I could not wish a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not follow.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started closing, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called “be in the process, stay in the process.”
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not ready to do something great.
Today we didn’t want fireworks, we just wanted to get a good outcome, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a period of one year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear on a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” she said.
Thirty-three years of clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Vietensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, goes to retirement.
The association is regarded as “model throughout Bavaria”.
A small drinking water target association as an example for the large water producers.
This was said some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian Radio.
Shortly later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken honored the Target Union.
The work of the Veitenste Group is considered “example throughout Bavaria”.
Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who has been employee for 31 years in the purpose association, of which 28 years as managing director.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinkwater Target Association of the Veitensteingruppe with its headquarters in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and wells with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the communes Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed as water guard in 1985 and was appointed as the Managing Director of the Target Association in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations in the weekend,” she said.
As outstanding events, she called the introduction and introduction of the new fountains (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountains (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the renewal of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no stop and there have been repeated innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has served with a lot of heart-blood for his water targets association and he has lived the water targets association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitensteing group for nitrate reduction before the Water Forum of the Subfranken District.
He received a lot of appreciation and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, on his side, praised Waterwart Alfons Griebel, who has worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water guard and he was a loyal knop.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he referred to the fountain construction and the restructuring of the purpose union.
The biggest challenge and the hardest task, however, was the roof break at the high container at the Church Lauter on a January 3th.
Here they had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be provided with water.
Also the supply of Neubrunn could only beined once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with slices.
The management of the drinking water target association was transferred to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who is the successor of Rupert Göller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son's autism Tiago - and addresses to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
“The medicine has made great progress,” the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was discovered with her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago has gone well forward and now learns private in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: When I ask him something that's two years ago when I singed Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
He is the happier man on earth.
Tiago originates from Netrebko's connection with the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargteheide - Man Shoot on Life Partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and wounded her deadly.
“The man called us and said he had killed his companion,” a police spokesman said.
The murderer is on escape, after which he will be heard publicly.
Now all over the country, because Sven S. could be on the road.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, burning and has a smoothness.
Police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a smooth.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could carry the weapon with him, the police said.
Whoever sees Sven S. calls the 110.
The police are talking about a “relation state”.
The victim was in 1988, the assassin in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the incident or the relationship between the murderer and the victim, but it confirmed that one person was killed.
“It is a murder crime.”
“We don’t say more at the moment,” a police spokesman in Lübeck said.
According to eye witnesses, a Special Operation Command (SEK) was on the site.
Steel - Light View for German Steel Industry
The crisis-proof and energy-intensive German steel industry remains saved by additional costs in millions.
The financial burden that threatened the industry from the ecosystem promotion is from the table.
It remains in the liberation from the renewable-energy waste in the warehouses to the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeinen Zeitung" (WAZ, Freitagausgabe).
“I’m really happy that we finally achieved that after two years of negotiations.”
Consequently, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers that use the gases from the elevator to produce electricity for their own consumption to the cash.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of €120 to €240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG emulation falls by 20 percent.
But this is also not raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on its own electricity production.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely defined.
Particular importance has Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry.
“In terms of our campaign ‘Steel is the Future’, this is a first step.”
“More must follow.”
“In addition to the reform of the emission rights trade, climate and employment targets must be considered,” said IG Metall Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further as China, the world’s largest producer country, threw massive steel to the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers call on price dumping to Chinese steel companies.
During this spring, the situation was slightly relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties have an impact on import steel, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have dropped.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry premier Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
In the end, the prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost decreases.
Thyssenkrupp also did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tons, they produced about six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association Steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced now dropped in the second month consecutive.
Since the beginning of the year, the production is 2% below the previous year's value.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order condition.
Community, mind, health: singing makes seniors good
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school chorus, in the Lehramt study she plunged the field of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly chorus.
“Song moves me – emotional and physical,” she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, happy and more alive in general, she says.
In addition, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the chorus and share the joy of music with the same-minded, Hackler describes.
Through regular reunification, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in age, a chorus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her chorus: “To talk and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other – a chorus is a very special form of association.”
Singing in a positive sense can be anxious, says Hackler.
As a result, seniors exercise a deep and controlled breath.
Those who regularly ask for their lungs don’t get out of the dust so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of elderly organizations.
In older generations, common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song texts and especially melodias, people with dementia find themselves into long-lasting events.
When singing, the head is also required for a special performance, Lenz explains.
At the same time, focusing on your own voice and a prescribed rhythm and adapting to the other singers is a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience by singing in the chorus, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the chorus.
Showing myself: If I practice for a long time for something, I’m getting better and growing beyond me – this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz suggests.
You don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who's already listening when a sound goes around?
Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says hackers.
If someone from the circles of acquaintances sing in an elderly chorus, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overview of the chorus in the surrounding area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church chorus can contact the church or the church preacher directly.
Many seniors can also be found via the internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the Internet search.
Whoever has the desire to sing should definitely join a chorus, suggests hackers.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating – that’s true for every age.
Cats React More Sensitive Than Cats to Young Beasts' Cry
Biologists have studied in Hannover what effect the call of cat babies has on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen did not leave the men cold, but they were always the same, unlike the women.
Women’s cats can recognize the excitement rate of cat babies on the miauen of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the lights of cats who wander in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Hannover Medical College (MHH) have found out.
Cats respond to the calls of cats, but always the same.
“Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miauen of less and strongly excitated young animals are either not perceived or not significant for men,” said biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the special magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and tone height of the cat scream differed from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the MHH’s pet.
They were first called by the little ones, who were taken out of the curve for three minutes and separated from the mother and sisters.
On the other hand, they were faced with screams of stronger exciting cats, which were further raised.
The researchers consider their results meaningful despite the small sample.
“All women, even those who didn’t have their own grandchildren, responded differentially to the scream,” Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call was played by the much more exciting cats.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
“A surprise was that the men reacted at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have several times studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, Biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski to go to Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest order has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, a major football game will be held in Turkey.
Before the duel between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is required.
Even when the emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government warned that the daily life of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
It is also not stopped before football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the Prosecutor's Office issued an arrest order.
Accordingly, the Sükür now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür will be the supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is charged with the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days remains valid until October, in fact it has no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The night "democracy watchers" on public places throughout the country has announced Erdogan to end on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
In particular, the fans of the Workers Club of Besiktas are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
What the majority of the Turks, however, unite in view of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military pushes.
There even the fans themselves agree — no matter whether their heart hits for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the "Gala" Pokal winner, it will be especially back to Lukas Podolski.
His sporting value was demonstrated by the Cologne in the last season: With 17 goals and nine models in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first game time as the top score of his team.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1-0 victory.
The "Fanatik" newspaper admired him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconciling end.
After the first round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" are also out early in the Europa League.
In the Super League it was only sixth.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We’ve done that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas the game year went better.
Particularly thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasonal meetings as Super League Defender King, put the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and only borrowed to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return after his EM vacation due to the political situation in the country.
“If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it,” said Fikret Orman, head of the Kicker club magazine.
But for this, the storm must be ready to give up about a third of its estimated annual salary of €7.5 million, Orman explained: "We can't pay his salary in Florence."
Despite doping, these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been arrested twice due to doping (2001 and 2006)
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other overwhelmed light athletics players can just laugh about it – they are fighting in Rio for medals.
The topic of doping remains determining the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer, Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping blockade, had complained about her start right shortly before the games, was unjustified at her start (100 meters of breast).
There was a scary scenario: with a smiling smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When he found that he was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a glorious tower.
However, there are many other athletes who, despite the doping past, start at the Rio Olympics.
Here is a review:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m/US): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He has been blocked twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and former world champion is running even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-staffel/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month blockade in 2010 after she was proven to take the pain medication Oxycodon.
She had severe tooth pain after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discussions/Croatia): 2011 Olympic champion of 2012, 2013 World Championship and 2010–2016 European Championship were positively tested for the forbidden stimulant, methylhexanamine.
Perkovic opposed the conscious intake and was blocked for six months.
The four longest curves this year go to the account of the big gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m season/US): The Beijing Olympic winner and twice world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and was blocked for 21 months.
A means for penis enlargement was responsible, said merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 meters is the fastest man ever in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Very little athlete has received so many medals afterwards.
Thus, Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old was also forced to give Olympia Silver 2004 due to steroid doping and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
The Bronze Medal of the 2008 Olympics was re-recovered on the basis of a ruling by the International Sports Court (CAS).
With 80.04 m, he is ranked 2nd in the world list.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record and gold favourite was tested positively only in May, but may still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found signs of taking a prohibited supplement, the blockade of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mildly expired and started on July 13.
Bombing in Thailand: Austrian woman injured, several killed
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and was treated in the hospital, but she had already been able to leave it again.
His return was planned for the beginning of September.
It is unclear whether the further explosions on the resort island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, first exploded two bombs on Thursday night in an outskirts.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosions went up again and another man was killed, according to the police.
Furthermore, a bomb explosion was in Phuket earlier.
During the detonation near the holiday beach Patong, a taxi driver was injured, according to the police.
In Surat Thani, on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city worker.
The explosion, according to the authorities, went into the air in a flower beet in front of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast claimed several injured.
There is a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
“The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting,” Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
“We assume that it is a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to talk about possible motives, but it’s probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern of the attacks that are typical of the bombing attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by the enemy of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence reports on the ongoing attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed about the exact time and places.
It is unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police urged their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are smaller bomb attacks in Thailand, but they often do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim parts of the population, unnecessary travel to these provinces will be evacuated.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This will have great influence on the military in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improved economic situation and tourism.
The military council, which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloodshed, claims to be favorable to bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
Nevertheless, the military has not managed to capture the rebellion of Muslim rebels that has been flooding in the southern part of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack in the country’s recent history.
The right "Identity Movement" has come into the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federation have also placed the group under observation.
“We see in the ‘Identitären Bewegung’ indicators for efforts against the free democratic basic order,” said Hans-Georg Maaßen, Chief Constitutional Protection Officer of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamated in an extremist way.
We are also watching the movement.
The “Identity Movement” is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to “multicultural road”, “uncontrolled mass migration” and “the loss of its identity by overseas”.
Constituent defenders in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thüringen - are already observing the "identitaries".
Maßen said his authority agreed closely with the state authorities on the decision.
“Grups like the ‘Identity Movement’ are trying to get their target group from where they are,” the head of constitutional protection said.
Generally, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with poppiger music.
Islamists and right-wing extremists do so.
This is not a good advertising for your own thing.
Propaganda is intended to address people emotionally.
Young people are especially vulnerable.
that is dangerous.
Lastly, there were reports from several federal countries about the contacts of the “identitaries” with AfD politicians.
Matthew said he had no knowledge about it.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are relevant only from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people who are extremist, changes their target direction and thus becomes extremist.
Therefore, it is crucial whether such persons have taxing influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
Given the significant increase in law-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee settlements, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there may be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may be that more right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are formed to plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German or European control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were formed on the regional level or on social networks.
Maßen expressed concern about the fact that many violations went on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects of asylum attacks were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
“Therefore, many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists before, who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, voted for the CDU, SPD or left, who then have radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist motions.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Haste will be the internet hit
Not always the Olympic players or world records determine the scores at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Havte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swim so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV images.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks thereafter had become a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his course with a 48-second break and reached the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not just sports figure that attracted the attention of international media.
Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian man received a special start right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more familiar.
Since the majority of athletes are running in Ethiopia, he just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Haste is ready for the big race.
The first top names quickly made the round.
Some media called him the "Robel of the Wal".
In reference to a "Wohlstandsbauch" the English boulevard "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun about him.
His time, he hit only with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with “Eric the Eel” were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the race of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to run alone in a course of over 100 meters.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired.
The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store in the New Place has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old police officer had left her business on Monday at 17:30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they came back next morning around 8:15, about 250 euros were missing from the box.
Traces of the murderer were not found.
There is also no video monitoring.
Trump does not see the threatening election failure so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke at a campaign in Florida.
If it does not change with the election to the US president, Donald Trump has already an alternative idea.
Then he goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, it would be relatively important to him: "At last it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television channel CNBC.
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, it’s okay, Trump said.
He described President Barack Obama and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS).
More and more resistance was formed within his party.
Post increases in trade with electric carriers
A vehicle of the Deutsche Post in Action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently large.
The post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The company will soon start trading with the carrier.
The Post will also offer its electric carriers on the free car market from next year.
“We want to enter the sale to third parties,” a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been investigating for months whether it is intended to sell its own StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other enterprises.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said there are constantly demands, such as from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the postigen manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group intends to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and plays a full transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run.
“We’re going to take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said in late July.
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet.
StreetScooter has been active on German streets since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The departure came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chairman of Matthias Hartmann becomes uncertain, the longer the success he promised remains.
Turbulence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company’s management, the world’s number five industry is facing a new start of staff.
The CEO of GfK will leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Council, Arno Mahlert, will with effect leave the Supervisory Board on September 12.
The leadership in the board will be taken over by the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, the company.
He will officially take over the role of a “reporter” until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "diverse views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not say the details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investors said on Friday that the shareholders were last disappointed with the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been on the top of GfK since 2011.
“The results of the restructuring are not yet seen even after 5 years,” he said.
Given the last bad GfK trading numbers, every shareholder will some time be unhappy.
“If this was the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” he said.
The company had not been able to stop its losses even in the second quarter of 2016 after reverses in the previous quarter.
With €361.2 million, the turnover was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
In the first half of the year, the turnover decreased by €721.2 million by 3.4 percent.
The profit in the second quarter was burdened primarily by the company’s decline in value due to its difficult economic situation.
The company’s value descriptions of 139 million euros that became necessary in the Consumer Experience business sector caused a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had achieved a corporate profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus runs in Krummhörn: Eight injured
In a bus crash with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the victims were seriously injured, the police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her information, had to escape from an encountered cargo, which was partly on the counterway line.
The bus came down to the right side of the street and crashed into a grave, a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund.
“Due to the location of the bus, the people couldn’t leave the bus independently,” she said.
Firefighters release the inhabitants.
Six rescue cars and a medical car arrived at the place of the accident on Landstraße 2.
The injured passengers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (until 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (until 2.18 euros).
The wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After a overwhelming calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU), the approval of the budget by the council of Kulmbach found that these wastewater plants are undergoing coverage.
The Kasendorf Market is obliged, on the basis of legal grounds, to operate the facilities cost-coveredly.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens, as well as industrial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.
The tax increase is between 48 and 67 percent.
As administrator Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period will also be balanced.
Schmidt found that all three wastewater plants are relatively small plants with a very small wastewater attack ranging between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution basis, for example, the costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the wastewater supply in all three installations is slightly reduced.
Furthermore, in the last calculation period, all three installations have not at least fallen significantly due to their age, due to the costs of repair and repair.
The facility in Azendorf is 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical ventilation plant had to be replaced due to a damage.
In the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl, the 20 years old funding facilities had to be overloaded from ground to ground, and in the Lopp Teichdeklaranlage, after 20 years of operation, the first clearance was to be removed, the clearance slope was removed, and an additional ventilation possibility was installed in order to be able to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: “These extraordinary expenditure included the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period.”
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012.
Stonehouse made it clear that with the small waste waterfall in the three plants the operating and maintenance costs "fullly overcome".
In addition, Schmidt added, the market community has been saved from large entertainment costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to remain precarious for the long term, especially because the area of supply of the wastewater targets association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended by these facilities because they are defective facilities.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, with positive 0.2% recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured by the CPI -0,8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, meaning the monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0,2%.
In July 2016, a price increase compared to the previous month was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %); transport (1,8 %); leisure and culture (6,3 %); restaurants and hotels (1,2 %); various goods and services (0,3 %).
The prices fell in clothing and shoes (2,2 %); furniture, household equipment and routine expectations (0,5 %); health (0,1 %).
The prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco; houses, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education.
Snapchat ‘anime’ effect as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is animated, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that is bordered with absurdity.
You can turn into ananas, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lightenstein painting.
The filters are unblumbled, properties distorting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All errors come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week it proposed to some users a filter that gave them sliding eyes, false teeth, and scattered wings, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Golden face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and anxiety were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not a cartoon of Asians.
But those outdoors who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of injuring clishes.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widespread about the photos, wrote that the filter "was harmless and gently said unpleasant."
She added that "it's difficult to argue with the counter-setting of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-looking, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the reverse extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural crossroads.
The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in hand.
And Snapchat large audience of young people - who are more varied in terms of race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, "there's much more difficult to keep such things unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a media post and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices on Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her post with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Of they don’t have a different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something against it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has mostly left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently appointed a HR manager focusing on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said she would close her Snapchat account and added, “I wonder if she needs more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, confirms Congress committee
Military officials of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual situation would have allowed on the site, a Congress investigation committee said in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who how leaders changed their estimates on the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The news service information typically received by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly recorded a more positive picture of the U.S. efforts against terrorism than the actual state would have allowed and was constantly more positive than the analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What has happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the U.S. efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although it does not provide any direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their leaders to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report said.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recovery of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigations, it’s so clear,” said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's heads changed the intelligence reports to reduce the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force up after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.
Additionally, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which matched some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIS and the Iraqi security services," the high-powered Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Shiff, said in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, “retarded the publication of intelligence reports,” damaged the morality among analysts and “give excessively little space for different opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they did not find any evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were taken after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Cmdr Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress reports while the General Inspector’s investigations are still ongoing.
But he also said that “experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The investigations have feedback on the question of a successful air campaign under U.S. leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year’s accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the twistings of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, predicted only a small crew in Iraq and little time spent thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker’s team, according to government officials, found that, contrary to the government’s statements, air strikes against the Islamic State raffinery would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional raffinery would have entered into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by Legislative members for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing in the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in Women's Field Hockey, a showdown with Britain is ahead
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won by 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they can’t remember what they’ve ever done.
“I don’t know,” she said.
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.
But she knows that the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British on the first place, which remains unsuccessful after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second places each.
The first place will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer from the way that leads the other group.
Whatever the game will take place on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising turmoil through their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had for the first time a hockey player in the hands at the age of three (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn’t qualify for the team.
Then came the year 2012 in which everything was wrong for you and your team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the national team's coach and thus things began to turn to better.
“A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the job pension in London that we now have.
We were able to complete the row.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the torrents in the first half of the game with a back-hand shot from the middle area.
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tired and kept the match from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and scratched the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. tournament, Jackie Briggs, who had to record one goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how good it will depend on the result of the next match on Saturday.
In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it’s the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable, a fast stable gap between competition and aspirations.
It’s like the Olympic facel itself is a burning stain that goes from the arm shooter to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the waiting room in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time at the Olympic Games and is a female shark with grapes, could have been among those well-known names that are sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and welfare TV advertising if he was a swimmer, turner, or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not light every event the same.
Beyond the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breasts and let it rule for a long time.
But if I should humbly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me focus on the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so narrow in the last 16 years that many of those I had questioned didn’t know it’s an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. has sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolines and until 2012 it has had an athlete who has managed it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians the prices for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unclean ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a ground-based enthusiast.
It has a humorous potential – the potato-floor of its ever-wishing outbreak – but also the grace of turning and immersion, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "spinning board."
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (trains, heights, and salts) before they land on their feet.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program by performance, difficulty degree and "flight time".
Twenty-three athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopers have to go further, faster, up and above in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the goal, sometimes toward and back, up and down on the playground.
They not only hunt the target line or the output wall, but in television broadcast also another autumn goal: the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tears.
But that’s also what I feel as a bit tired when watching these games.
From that, the trampoline provides a breath.
The Vector of the Trampoline Printer is above.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she flows off, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then easily back up.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no harsh attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreameric, elegant removal of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14:00.
In the middle of the Olympia manny they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If awareness increases can only be achieved by attacking and objectivizing male athletes – as the male U.S. tourners recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is waiting for his air-to-air new fishing community.
"One Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long is a US Allied
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators, calling for political changes in Ethiopia, met with the government’s violent resistance.
Witnesses say that thousands of protesters were killed during strikes with police.
Is Ethiopia going to break down?
Over the past ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people fled to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government’s response, according to human rights organizations, was unrighteous.
Witnesses said police were shooting and killing hundreds of unarmed protesters.
Current videos about the protests, which are likely from the past or early of this year, show how security forces hit young people with shots while they were forced to make a handset against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future,” said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a significant pace.
Its infrastructure has dramatically improved – there is a new pendler train in the capital Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was nothing but an example of democracy – human rights organizations have continuously led the government’s oppression – the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the widespread deserts.
But that could change.
“When you oppress people and they have no other option than to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a professor in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to the wreckage in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this crazy, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogad National Liberation Front, who have been more or less pushed over the past years, could take advantage of the turbulence and rear arms.
Several factors explain why feelings of trembling now explode after years of its predecessor hinkle under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years a lot of Ethiopiaans have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do on a regular basis, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxy that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopans said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the Eones, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia primarily from Christian high countries, prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat land areas.
But that is also changing right now.
“We’re going to coordinate under a mirror,” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The major protests took place in Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebellion leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say he was skilled in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to handle opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected for relatively uncertainty reasons to accept Mr. Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more blood vessels.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to be overwhelmed by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent races, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months, and this period of trouble passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler train, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconduct of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-led shops in Gondar, an amharic city, and the hatred of Tigray is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the U.S. and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its allies to collapse in a already volatile area.
“This,” Mr. Abdi said, “is a very thin grassmigration.”
Donald Trump says his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarkism"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dissolve the last controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeated claims that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the “founder” of the Islamic State terror group had not been seriously meant.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his counterparts, who are trying to take him in protection during an eventful phase, into the particular position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After he had made the claim at a campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rejected the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to claim that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump slightly weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism runs down on Mr. Trump as he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to the falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held talks about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return on this issue again.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already introduced sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism on himself when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Naturally I meant it sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to rush back if necessary.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear" according to how the reaction goes out," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of tightening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has taken an even more tightening tone as his survey values have further dropped.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed a great leadership in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's screams have brought his loyal counterparts into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former New York mayor and one of Trump’s most prominent prosecutors, made a great effort to defend the candidates today in a Thursday CNN interview.
“I think what he says is legitimate, political comments,” Giuliani said so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was a unknown, small organization, he called it backbänkler, completely wrong and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by dismissing it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and warned them to go around on each of his words and be prejudiced against him.
He humiliated the “bad, wicked” television experts trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some Democrats spotted Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once over the price withdrawn from the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a stunning café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay a bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was withdrawn by the prices from its Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Local people saw it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a seif business."
But if New York is a change, then it is a new invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and manager of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outdoors, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, had a lot of contribution.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the food card are sandwiches with speck and cheese and there are garnitures such as caprons and saturated beans.
There are natural shootings.
The cafe does not serve beer anymore, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a constant current on old tribal customers.
“Many old customers were also withdrawn from Williamsburg by prices,” he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she was moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way on her own.
After the verb was closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was about coffee and culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee that is another new supplement on that day.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and loyal customer since the beginning of Verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came four to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they are preparing my Everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he exchanges his Everything bag with speck, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn’t worry about the seafood business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie proposed to make a special soap for Verb with the coffee coffee of the cafe as a ingredient.
“I think we’re going to go on her offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints also accepted the cafe.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to deliver it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold-brushed coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a tribal scientist and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the room and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a flavorer, President Roosevelt had a flavor for refined flavours of the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterwheat soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato pyre and as a dessert a flame pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" handed about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, rough-free bowl in the Flatiron District, which is already in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, eaten truthahn with potato pyre and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
“Rich foods were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was soil bread, liver cakes and bean bread.
They were made from a ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many nuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe was laughing.
“It must have been placed in the stomach like dust,” he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was a All-You-Can-Eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served fresh-packed pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" describes the ways with which the country was surrounded by not being the slave land anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, stressed topic for the Americans," Coe started why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally tensioned: mysterious foods such as bread and casserole became basic foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to re-use food residues," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unpleasant ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Its own mixture has been tested as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even a healthy cooking sense.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked cabbage with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular add-on at lunch,” Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues to say, “It was surreal.”
Butter and baked cabbage do not match each other.
It was typical for many household recipes.
As never before or since then, budgeters - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - pushed the country's eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budget politicians” and to face the challenge of turning pomps like cremed spaghetti with potatoes into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historic snacks.
Especially delicious are the reports on the government’s response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-mich-kuchen-food attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen in his kitchen, he ate like the million-weight man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with garlic sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a almost golded dining room and wearing a smoking.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to statue an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a household woman with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortless prepared.
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the country came back to its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple said they had better understood Ziegelman's mother's eating habits when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
“She had a real fear of food waste,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “He actually made people sick.”
There was the windbag incident.
After the tables were cleansed at Eisenberg's, they and Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the flame dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a thin name.
There was no shelled shell, only flames, a bit of flour, sugar, water and pepper.
Everyone sinked somewhat disappointed a teaspoon into the tires, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste badly.
Coe got a trace three times.
As a can-do budgeter he told his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
Bomb attack killed: he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a fascist bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the Image Journal, so far saved the lives of 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives on the ground to pull people out of destroyed houses and to provide first aid in the area of war.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil defendant showing him at a 11-hour rescue of a baby from the shrimp of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a bright symbol figure in the gray of the war.
As a hero, however, he has never seen himself, said according to the image: "For me this is the real jihad."
“When I die to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself was a victim of an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw four phase bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorgas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was intended to hit terrorists.
Greenland: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
A rare view.
Greenland hairs usually come to the surface only in the winter.
This bear was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swim with a well of 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland hairs only get young at the age of 150.
The Greenland Sea swims gently along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 meters away.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter long animal accelerates to a set of 2.6 km/h – and is half as fast as a rob.
However, this slowly characterized lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland Hai who could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commented on this lifetime, which means a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland bees would become stone.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland hairs are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the glacier in front of the thin populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and the Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface only in the winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of the Greenland hae.
They measured their time rate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of the Spitzbergen.
In the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the knee bone of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrouille at the bottom of the Ice Sea and look for Kadaver, who drow down from higher waters.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland hairs that fishermen took from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest bear was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lamb’s lenses.
This center of the eye lens occurs before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts drove larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lenses, however, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials, it is believed to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland hairs, on the contrary, had a normal amount of carbon-14 in their lenses, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 hour for a 493 centimeters long Greenland Hai showed an age of 335 years, while the record-hai with 502 centimeters is expected to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland-hai women only get adolescents when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.
Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of gender maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland haie with the reproduction is obviously allowed at least one and a half century time.
This is likely to be a world record for turtles as well.
That such methusalems live mainly in ice waters is no coincidence.
Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland Valley, in whose speck on the neck was a 120 year old harpun peak, was captured in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals that live there often runs on savings.
So they mature later – and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal infuses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than the heat loss of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"So a small animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as soon as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal should instead invest its resources in a long life.
Construction in Double Package
The issues related to the construction have been discussed by the municipal council in the last meeting.
With relief, the board accepted the announcement by mayor Robert Putz that "in the end the marketing of the recently announced housing leaves may begin."
Following the clarification of the questions of land, parceling and solving and the applications could be submitted to measurement, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - development section 1) is no longer in the way to the interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and rising seniors equally.
As it was said, volunteers can notify themselves in the council from now on, about the award of the parcels the council is expected to consult in its September session.
In order to comply with requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises associated with the creation of jobs, the municipality council decided to amend the area use plan, which was re-established only in the spring of this year, in parts.
Thus, in the area of undertime larns, the commercial area already specified there will be extended by two parcels towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Am Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies moved from London.
“It’s very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s Financial Markets and Real Estate Competence Field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, the admission in the UK is sufficient.
This is used by large U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs at Main in five years.
The headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Board (ESRB).
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision,” says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large funding industry, however, as well as Dublin, the infrastructure is worse.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport.
In addition, the city points with easy-to-access commercial real estate.
“In Paris it’s not so easy to find free and high-quality offices,” Voigtländer says.
In the Seine, the rental rates for top-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a Mercer corporate counseling ranking, the city is seventh, Luxembourg is 19th, Dublin is 33th and Paris is 37th.
Although quality of life is a question of preference: “With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors,” the IW follows.
But despite Brexit voting, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, economic researchers believe.
In London, according to the National Bank Helaba figures, at the end of 2015 around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry, in Frankfurt it was 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation for the violation of Merck’s two patents that were linked to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. lawyer revealed a pattern of Merck’s misconduct, including Meinid and other unethical acts.
U.S. law enforcement judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead has the right to pay the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal more than 90% of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed each other and claimed ownership of laboratory works under which Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead, was founded.
U.S. supported troops say they have regained full control over Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city have left it, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are now staying through the city after the exile of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians held as hostages by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish, the Manbij Military Council associated with the DKS, told Reuters.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are just undergoing cleaning work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her tax declaration for 2015, which resulted in a revenue of $10.75 million for the Democrat candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax return of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clinton donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned $5.3 million in speech honors; the former Foreign Minister gave $3 million income from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her term in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's vice-president candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, publishes along with his wife Anne Holton his tax statements of the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a sharp opposition, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the train,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the publication of the Democrat’s presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits have been completed.
Trump’s critics, including Republican 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his donations to charity organizations, his business officers and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already swallowed on the topic and on Friday posted a video on the internet in which high-ranking Republicans call on Trump to publish his tax declaration.
She also spoke about the issue on Thursday during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax declarations," she said to the crowd.
Politico that Trump did not pay any or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a regulation named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industry Congress has its seat here, called for Trump to attend a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to an IRS tax examination and Trump is "fearful" of the voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has released the tax declaration backwards until 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40,5%.
The 2015 Clintons tax declaration showed that they only received $100 of their income as a salary, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main fund was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clinton dividends and revenue of $109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks bodies promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into humans-habited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders.
The method has proved effective, and the HoneyGuide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. Nature Conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-level method to protect their homes and harvests without hurting animals.
In the past, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
“Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with them much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without hurting the elephants,” said Damian Bell, Managing Director of Honeyguide in a statement.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a fence and the blasting into a corner.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" will be thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is adjusted to the firewall.
When it becomes inflammatory, the condom breaks up with a knall and spreads fine dust into chili powder into the air.
A hole right usually already out to hunt the elephant.
The last option is a wanderer who throws a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council votes unanimously: No Kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer’s investment projects are accepted by entrepreneurs with a kusshand – but it is just the retail in the core city that is considered significantly expanding.
The request for the new construction of a sale skios at the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkons in construction, however, was now unanimously rejected by the City Council.
“In principle, we welcome new business operators, but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine River, this kiosk doesn’t fit,” Michael Hubrath told the CDU group.
Jewish director crashes Berliner Hotel because Israel's prefix has been removed after "Arab" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots dissolved a media poll after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli forecast as Arab guests, according to an employee, "will have requested."
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah", left his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's land list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call center.
After seeking an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he got there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded the prefix to be deleted,” Lanzmann’s employee said.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a "great shame," the South German newspaper.
We were disappointed and disappointed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has entered this hotel chain in Germany is even a bigger shame.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw “the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet, in which people called the whole a scandal.
Some understood the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "understood" the alleged requests of Arab guests.
“Shame you,” it said in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurpristendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly revealed all the accusations of itself and called the incident a "feat" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct instruction to not include Israel in the list of quick votes," the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman for Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police deploy drunk gas and rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
Police deployed drilling gases and rubber shots against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disconnect the students, which led to the police deploying rubber shots and drunk gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstrations to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spreading on the walls against the interim president Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after mass protests went on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was dismissed by a Senate vote on her withdrawal from office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70,9 percent in comparison to the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been repealed, the interest of Russian companies in shops in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies have established existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that the trade between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved through supplies of machines, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan goes out of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign delegation issued approximately 35,000 visas, primarily visa, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran has reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes that it will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have kept the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses Looking For: Drink Market In The Forest
A robbery was committed on Thursday night on the Drink Market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under holding a gun, three people in dark clothes, who had their faces shrinked, demanded the employee of the beverage market to issue cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money has been paid, the police don’t know.
The murderer was estimated to be between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, which is relatively small.
The drink market is directly from the parking lot of the Rewe market from accessible and poorly visible.
After the attack, the offenders must be dropped in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the shooter parking place opposite the parking entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who at the time of the incident (at 19.45 p.m.) have made observations that are related to the robbery incident must urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and have fun in summer holidays
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youths of the social-educational day group/social group work of the Nagold Child Protection Federation with their guardians on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet, leisure room Hardtwäldle, the lively group was quartered during the first school holidays week.
Several full-day excursions were on the programme.
First, we went to Bretten with a visit to the Streichelzoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Kelts.
In the hot days, the group entertained at the Deep Sea in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plank.
Culinaryly, children and caregivers were worn with their own prepared meat foods such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewellery were created from pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman-mole game.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby tide, the evening on the fire and the final "Bunte evening".
On the day of the trip home the sun laughed and the children and youth returned home with pleasure.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to overcome the time until the next Rome wall trip of all ministers in expected two years, the Supreme Minister’s round of St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.
Different guiding targets were examined and finally the Bishop’s city of Freiburg was chosen, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Port of Mercy opened for this purpose at the Freiburger Münster, a special guiding targets were offered.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Sanctuary Rooms went on their way.
The evening before, the priest Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim cross and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb, the train was conducted to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Loved Woman stands, and thus the pilgrimage was arrived from the Münster.
The individual day tours were surrounded in the morning and in the evening each by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writings.
But even on the way, the minis on the field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly rejoiced to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrimage.
For the nights were available parishes of the local parishes.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a delicious as well as enhancing dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Days afterwards, the stage to St. Peter, which was the hardest path, had to first descend about 500 meters of height and then be climbed again.
The winning prize was a joint grill at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilgrimage Day in St. Peter's Impossible Monastery, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis met the late afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and crossed the gates of Mercy.
With a little impulse, God was grateful here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage target were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacrist and the altar.
The next day was time for the Breisgaumetropolis.
In the afternoon, the train returned to Horb.
At the end, all the participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotch Callum Skinner drops home as British gold runs for cycling sports
Scotland's Callum Skinner rose to fame last night in the male team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his landman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. The young bond made the legend proud when he drove home to capture a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after getting only a modest sixth place in March at the rail world championships in London despite Hoys' withdrawal.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hindes appeared.
Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in Scotland that has now evolved.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
The British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was shortly back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change in strategy made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes ran in a higher track to slow him and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell up Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “It’s a smooth comparison.”
I am only here to do my best and make me a name.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he intentionally fell on the train after a weak start.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from the English rivals.
With such a great victory this time there was no such problem.
Hindes said, “It feels like London with the entire GB flags on the tribune.”
We have been together as a team in the last three months.
We have gone so bad at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that awaits us successful five days in the Velodrom.
With Kenny's form, it is possible that he repeats Hoy's triumph of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; that day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a profit of six gold medals and a silver medal.
This is the same as today.
Kenny is the next to participate in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I only enjoy this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, “If he wins another two gold medals, he should be hit as the Knight.”
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 in the target.
The world record, which won in 2012 in London Gold, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competitor, where Wiggins will surely focus.
He had struggled yesterday with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women’s competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in World Record Time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary demonstration of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were down.
There were dramas in the background, according to the resignation of the technical manager Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexuality and harassment accusations, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated.
The future of Portland’s mixing due to the cancellation of the energy agreement
The future of Portland's aluminum mixture in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - are on the ground, as the facility operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus will terminate all supply contracts, as the supplier energy company.
This step followed the government’s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the facility.
A 20-year grant will take place in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland.
Not less than 2,000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be threatened by a closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the mixer consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry mixer, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The mixing of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the price of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum mixer with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is in majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through mixing,” the company said.
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called “assurance transactions” which would have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will end in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts in the 17th financial year will contribute to the revenue,” the power supplier said.
All potential impacts on the income on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong deadline markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL that it had already recorded the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "attending a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to expel the contracts, the "capacity of Alcoa ... to operate the melting or to guarantee the power supply to the melting" does not affect.
The U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have entered into force from November this year, even though there is still a declaration due why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn due to the poor economic conditions of the industry from the possible closure of the Portland mixer in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Referring to the statements of analysts earlier this week, Operations Head Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both installations disappear from the market, this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the [electricity market].
And it would not be good for us as electricity producers,” he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), written reality video that shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This represents the click-related plot of almost every birthday episode of a child's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "Do you think we'd have forgotten you?", with the honesty of a cartoon knit on a showroom at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.
Kendall's grand sister Kim may have hit her in the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on to see in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September edition is a league for itself.
The September edition is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With a scale more similar to an image band than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages of advertising).
The disclosure of his cover star is so desirably expected that in the last two years the images of the magazine have gone through even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Over the past few years there have been clearly more “famous ones that model” than “models that are famous ones” on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "through model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if all of it applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t like everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tensioned.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the mistakes of the moment."
These feelings got up again when the news with Jenner's appearance came out on the Vogue Cover.
But moving around the misfortune seems to pass through the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
In the true sense of the word, she is a supermodel.
It is for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation by Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her photographs of Cindy Crawford’s daughter to the magazine LOVE.
Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centers shelter 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s aid-need people are rejected by the municipal law centers each year, while the industry takes care of the effects of further reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly people, immigrants, aid workers, victims of violence and those who do not have any means for unfair delogation and similar – are refused in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already exaggerated, are prepared for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Director of the Queesland Municipal Law Centers James Farrell said that the latest survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centers showed that already thousands of people are rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only worsen without a cancellation of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland municipal law centers are chronically underfinanced, which means thousands of people are rejected from the important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unreasonable and repressive debt, families that go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of healthier people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We urge the Federal Attorney General and Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to repeal these shortcomings immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of municipal law centers and their customer communities as well as that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled weapons
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February targeted a gun on an employee while traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit submitted on Wednesday at the Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months for the issue to be internally resolved before he realized that "this't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "racked a pistol, placed his right finger on the drawing, and hit the race in Vincent's knee wave," Bordini said in his charges.
After having complained to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already the same experience with Phillip, he said in the prosecution.
“We do not need to shoot down weapons to cause damage,” Bordini said.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an alarm when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and appointed judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media would have removed his words from the context and that he would not incite to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of the care obligation and from Philip for body injury and persistent mental damage.
Trump’s press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach a statement.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far conducted a controversial campaign.
The proceedings are in Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the Bundesländer Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), considerable losses occur to the government parties SPD and CDU.
This was revealed by representative surveys by the Opinion Research Institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule a little further, this is not possible according to the Berlin survey values.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party, according to the survey, is just short ahead of the CDU, which could regain to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (formerly 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
The Greens, despite slight losses with 6 per cent (formerly 8.7 per cent), returned to the Schweriner Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the countryside with 3% each.
According to the survey, in the Berlin House of Representatives, the SPD is only 23 percent (elections 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry, unlike 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clever.
The built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
The iPhone will be delivered with at least 16 Gigabyte.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months ago at the computer exhibition Cebit in Hannover as "Office in the West Bank format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to reach a lot for the standard at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to reach.
Even access to websites was possible through HTML browsers, although tortuously slowly.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be installed similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, that is, about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could guess in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything is different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile branch of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, it was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today the market is dominated by providers, who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, that is today for a lot of people daily.
In 2015, there were two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold, of which Samsung and Apple have lost 555 million.
The global sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-functioning of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in the beginning of 2007, when Apple’s chief Steve Jobs on the Mac-World announced the introduction of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a Internet communicator, everything can be easy to use through a touch screen.
Apple’s winning journey began, yet today, the iPhone is the group’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the revision.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
It is now said by Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is obvious 20 years after its invention.
Today, average people are looking at their mobile phones 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to remove the smartphone anytime,” said Janina Kugel, responsible for the Siemens Board of Staff.
Permanent availability is now considered as a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England has to lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communes and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefit from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs, and end the youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were forecast to us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame on the world stage.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow responds to every question asked by him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in successful growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion in time and budget infrastructure investment program, from T5 - which was chosen for the world's best airport terminal five years in a row to T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequent routes.
Now they are ready to deliver a third stage, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It’s time that we guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as ensuring our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to cope with advertising blocking are similar to a "catch and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook that its desktop page would change the coding in relation to its ads to make it difficult to recognize ad blocks to identify which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to overcome the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of Hin-and-Her struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the surroundings has been ongoing since the invention of ad-blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has engaged in the struggle is a strong indicator of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers; four times the number in 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users daily accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
The company has removed it on ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large percentage of the revenue, so Facebook seems worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “advertising preference tool” to get people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblock new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we are planning to address the problem," a spokesman from Facebook said in an email.
Ad blockers are a stump tool, so instead we’ve focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
A woman suspected to have committed suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
Police call witnesses after a woman was overturned in early morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Switzerland woman, who was overturned by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said, calling them and all witnesses to report.
A investigative procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoided?
This is something the prosecutor must decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers are not taken to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers should not assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released from the negligent murder after she had crossed and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer — who had responded to an emergency call — was driving in a justified way and that a man’s presence on the street was a “completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, the Venus was probably ever habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density atmosphere, could have ever experienced earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus might have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still slowly moving forward.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host lives and protect against rapid pollution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daylight to the Sun for two months,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainbow to shed the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is the average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.
The model brought out a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, in several billion years, the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans damped and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.
As their hydrogen disappeared, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left with a deadly greenhouse effect—the Venus, which as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Returns as Avalanche Trainer
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche’s coach and vice president of Hockey Operations on Thursday, leading a too small participation in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado's alternative president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the team will immediately seek a new trainer.
"In the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I have long and much thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, what it needs, and bring it to a higher level.
To this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization.
He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me about this decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Awards winner as the best coach of the League.
He led the team to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed in each of the last two years the postseason.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points down.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups—two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea workers resume talks, stop strike
Working struggles on the salary for North Sea oil workers are being suspended while all the struggling parties are sitting at the table for a new round of talks, the negotiating leaders said.
Streiks against the oil field service provider Wood Group were performed sporadically on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of settlement of the current dispute,” it said in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day sessions in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year to react to the problems.
The trade unions said their last strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wages cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates on its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate decrease follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to come through the market recovery.
For his part, Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to quit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-assembly with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower raw oil prices, a economic situation that was worsened by the Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with workers earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have occurred in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending for new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the playoffs
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiade’s Star Race.
The new data helps the astronomers understand why the stars in the horse rotate at different rates and in what connection the rotating times are with the planet's extinction.
“We hope that by comparing our findings with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The playoffs are 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in this star hole, which appeared about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They turn the fastest now.
To the highest rotation rates, these mature stars face large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spike—like sun spike—.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars of slower pirouets rotate than smaller.
“In the ballet of the playoffs we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Since the playoffs are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
“The Stellar Hump of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and thus hang their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and colleagues have in three newspapers detailed their latest analysis of the rotating rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star disappears
The tears went at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in the best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional withdrawal announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the t-shirt of his New York Yankees for the last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-fold All-Star game player of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was three times elected the most valuable player of the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has cost him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will work as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he made a few mile stones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old will not be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
For as successfully Rodriguez - headline "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the field.
In 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he had taken prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was blocked for 211 parties by the end of 2014 due to a processing in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is believed to be the main suspects of having received performance-supporting funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a dispute, the blockade was reduced to 162 meetings.
“The league could have even made me a benefit for 2014, because I’ve played 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said.
Even his goodbye days go without noise.
While many baseball legends in their last games again got the big stage, Rodriguez had to sit on the bank frequently.
“My job does not include a farewell tour.”
“My job includes trying to win any game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and was followed by the relationship with popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy stories from fans from the Yankee erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, the weight lift Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overwhelmed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete had won almost one medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases were announced at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, the 3000-metre swimmer Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lift Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the critical light athletics competition, these news come to untouch.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a mask for doping substances.
The International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had reached the fourth place in the final over 100 m but in only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to take part in the 50m freestyl trips.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-Test and a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter “very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation in the investigations,” Xinhua said in a statement: “We will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment.”
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa passed through, the 33-year-old took himself into the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the light athlete said.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is the blood-doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test was already positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately announced his speech with criticism of the athlete.
“I don’t understand why the athletes don’t make the right conclusions,” he said, “We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded.”
Therefore, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positively tested on anabolic steroid nandrolone.
Both refuse to take, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from launch, with an exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenia department also produces a number of bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent disputes between athletes.
Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
“Sun Yang Pinkelt Lila.”
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I'm going to give up," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
“I don’t have time or respect for doping fraud,” he said.
Sun was positively tested for stimulating trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championship, but only had a three-month stop.
Data Mistake: How Performing Hacker Threatening Their Ransomware
Programmaters of eradicating malware are currently targeting companies – and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past twelve months, partially several times victims of an attack with eruptor software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were once targeted by a ransomware eruption.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the rescue funds requested by the criminals to re-use the system and data attacked.
The criminals specialize their eruptor software according to the observations of Malwarebytes looking at attacks in corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the potential dismissal is significantly higher than that of private users.
“We are currently watching a terribly rapid evolution of malware,” said Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with the World.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the criminals discovered the kidnapping software for themselves.
Initially, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place terribly fast in the past months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it targetes for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the original sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the oppressors.
To get the end encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is on the game for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Consequently, the damage will be higher if a ransomware goes on.
22 percent of the affected German companies sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business completely, in one case people were at risk.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims, don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying will get their data back.
For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of a stop in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the kidnappers and come to the outcome: the criminals actually try to build a kind of customer service to get more money.
They explain to their victims through chat how they can pay through Bitcoin, create free-to-access support sites or uncodify free example files.
And if individuals are saved after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-point amounts to recover their data uncryptly.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware eruption, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual oppressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
“The supply range includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” Wisniewski says.
The kidnappers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is per infected computer.
"Generally the criminals then assign spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to defeat ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
The criminals are already pursuing new strategies.
“When data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful deterioration, the criminals threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” says Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the potential of damage depending on the type of data is even a lot higher than before.
Also, the criminals could in the future take up completely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the hacking conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a Internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of the winter, releasing such a blocked heating could be worth a rescue for some victims.
If the criminals then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe, and even the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the foundation, it doesn’t seem narrow anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well processed and appear pleasant, only the cockpit top side falls somewhat off there.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage room.
There is not only a bag room of 453 l available for high-designed and 1026 l for rounded back leaves, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back seat can be lifted up like a cinema seat and thus provide a staircase that is 1.24 m high from the ground to the roof.
The luggage room can be well charged, but the charging height is 650 mm a little higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-L diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the rotating moment of up to 300 Nm in wide rotating areas very powerfully.
He would do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l-bensin with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the control should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top variant "Executive".
The security systems include the City Emergency Brake Assistant (work up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Tracking Assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because when ranging, he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent time regulator responds to traffic sign recognition and drinks the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity, however, is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI boxes are under the arm and are therefore a little complicated to reach.
The approximately €29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel is okay.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gas from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not responsible: collapse on passenger bridge
A airline is not responsible for the collapse of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For a liability is only possible in the event of dangers that are typical for air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argue (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The prosecutor broke a knife in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay any damages to the man.
Case of illness: when the organizer pays
Sick travellers receive money back after their trip only if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than 10 percent of guests show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family was seriously affected by diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
Their illness led the travellers back to a defective cleaning facility that allegedly contaminated the sea water.
The family thought the trip had been defective - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the prosecutors did not succeed.
In fact, the cleaning facility was defective.
However, the organizer did not know about it just shortly before the complainants departed.
He had to assume that the sea was in good condition.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
There were no contaminations found in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - belongs to the general life risk.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be worried about further attacks.
The state must respond consciously and resolutely at the same time to terror threats.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the criminals with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, it will increase security and also strengthen the people’s consent to the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to realize the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, “in an average four-point order over several years.”
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to be improved, weapons law will be updated in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be complicated.
The last much discussed silence obligation for doctors should be kept according to Maizière’s words.
However, in the dialogue with the doctors, he wants to find solutions to how the danger of citizens can be reduced, he said with a look at psychic disorders.
In order to combat the radicalization of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further enhancing security."
It is important that the Minister of Internal Affairs has expressed clearly its opposition to actionism.
“This was an earring for the sharkmakers in the CDU/CSU,” Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (February).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double citizenship.
He considers a general prohibition of full confusion a constitutional problem.
You can’t prohibit everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, on the road or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chief Simone Peter warned the minister that he wanted to simulate action and action capacity with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Float speech and an exacerbation of the right of residence do not bring the people in this country more security."
Better traffic flow on the highway
It regularly stands on the surrounding street - here is a picture of November.
But that is to change: the rule of law is to be extended.
This is a good news for all the drivers who are stumbling on the surrounding road every night when they drive over the highway trail (A 43) in professional traffic.
The Landbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right abiegerspur by 700 meters on Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße departure.
Drivers can then rise directly from Hammer Street right.
The great advantage is that traffic is divided early, which improves the overall circulation on the many-way section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The trail stretching on the paddle irritates the drivers especially between 17 and 19 p.m.
Working days the backbone reaches the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only one-pure through the highway bridge.
The second track had to be restored about a quarter of years ago.
The reason: Statistical calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the carrier power required to take over, especially, the heavy cargo traffic two-way.
How long this engpass and the working day stable will last, the competent state operations cannot say.
However, it is to be expected with years: The bridge has an official remaining duration until 2034.
For the extension of the legal breakthrough, the state business has consciously chosen the less traffic time in school holidays, because disabilities can be expected.
Traffic will be carried out on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Journey: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the theatre piece "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Youth Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima’s association enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a show of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's Association, 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age attended the inscenation in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has aimed at the cultural integration of youth with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcoming classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Munster between September 2015 and March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and they speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming play time as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professional-led courses in the fields of singing, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatrical play and theatrical language mediation are in planning.
The project “Intercultural Journey” continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association is expecting many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star shoppings: hope for improved weather
The weather has made the star shrimp-guckers in the southwest of Germany a strike through the bill in the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was poorly suitable for observing the sky spectrum due to clouds and rain, the chairman of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will see a lot of stars in the sky.
The stars are Perseids, which are among the fastest stars with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they appear to come from the star image of Perseus that rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips Against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, in the night you wake up for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep before you wake up.
This is all other than relaxing.
After all, you are in good society with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as unrecoverable.
What are sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes for them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is understood is insomnia, i.e. a sleep and sleep disorder.
Just sleeping many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Home Doctors Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it may be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs.
Not rarely, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
“A very early awakening is especially common in a depression,” says Weeß.
And it can be that different factors condition each other.
For example, those who have a bandage accident can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and may begin to grieve about everyday problems and concerns, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well for a period of a month for at least three nights a week and are affected on the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The disability can look quite different: a person is tired, tired, unhappy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
To relieve sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleep pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
Low-level sleep physicians are hardly available in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first consult the doctor, advises Weeß.
It can by examination determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors recommend, for example, swelling with respiratory disorders, sick day fatigue, sleep changers, or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder, says Fietze.
There is no need to be prepared for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Let’s not sleep for lunch,” says Fietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glass, a chest and a sensor on the finger.
Also, a camera on the roof captures the sleeping person.
How can the affected people cope with the problems?
There are quite a lot of stalls on which you can sit for a better sleep.
Regular sleep and wake-up times, not lying too long in bed, not sleeping the day, not watching television to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you begin to count immediately, and that's absolutely not favorable.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first won gold at the World Short Railway Championships in Doha, and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has protected himself from his critical ex-team colleagues via Facebook.
“In a country where an Olympic winner receives a prize of €20,000 and a jungle king of €150,000, no one should be surprised by the lack of medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a lot and don’t look so closely on the topic of doping or even operate it.
“I don’t say that the controls should be stopped here,” he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler should have been to the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch.
This is the case with countries as well.
“Whoever can’t be controlled by independent controllers of the WADA/FINA for a certain time before the World Cup/World Cup is not allowed to participate,” the Electoral Hamburger, who is currently operating a ice division, says.
Airport: Baggage Thieves Arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
The Dusseldorfer police arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspect had committed several baggage and pocket robbery as a band.
Around 21.30 civilian officials in the area of the airport of Düsseldorf recognised a band that was known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men have committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and have committed these crimes collectively, working and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had arrived specifically to commit crimes in Germany.
In total, they earned more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, and, in the meantime, a rest of headset: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police count them among the city’s “dangerous places.”
If you go along the road from east to west, you get through the playgrounds, a fresh-fried kindergarten and a biolade.
On the facade of a gray house, someone has sprinkled “happy!”
In contrast to a Lidl, which is also planned to be destroyed, it is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
Articles about this “trending district,” as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain says, are, however, preferably painted with burning cars over the past few weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events.
In particular, the Berliner Innensenator Henkel has repeatedly since the beginning of the year stated for a hard action by the police against the project, calling the area "No-Go-Zone" for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleaned with 300 police officers, police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the site, blocked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown household owners.
On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled the displacement was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers displaced under the praise of sympathisants and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents go to a walk with children, people sit on the cottage in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergarten.
Left violence is not the main care of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are mostly angry by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concerns about increasing rent and gentrifying.
It doesn’t sound like a kiez who mostly sought police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berliner Innensenator and the police open between the house occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which today also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
The house occupations and the living projects that are born there have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the whole Mainzer street near the Rigaer.
While the Mainzers were plunged under a large police commission in a right-wing street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are partly still inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them now residents from the DDR times and former household owners share their kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rental, which has increased by 60 percent in new rental since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: you recognize them on inflated discs or freshly deleted facades that were inflated with color boxes.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-sautonome violence".
One reason not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are caused by material damage, which tends to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty for 17 years.
As for violent acts, it is weakening: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who were not.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal burning point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer was consciously pulled into the Riga Street - and remained.
That’s why it was so important for her that the inhabitants were able to get their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the expression over the district.
But in the eyes of residents, such as new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: through sightless new buildings in ancient buildings that displace the old residents.
“In the end, these are property apartments that are not interesting for many here – there are more people living here that are not so well placed,” she says.
“I can’t accept violence and destruction.”
But what do you do when you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
For trainers who are angry about colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Whoever grows should be aware of it - just like someone who goes to a cottage district, there can badly complain about noise.
All persons presented only with their name have asked not to be named with their right name.
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The Social Pedagogist supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all the actors: refugees, workplace refugees assistance, administration, authorities and whoever else is involved.
Regine Customer from the Working Circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-leading wol milk sauce, which above all has a problem.
So some - less shocking rather than targeting the diversity of desired tasks - had meant when the administration wanted to designate the job.
A management expert with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-year experience in the field of social work, was sought, just an egg-leading wol milk sau.
But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.
First of all, it is about organization, working with the people on the site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50% employment period for three years.
“It was the highest time,” says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Nearly new containers are on the road.
A serious problem has been for a while finding houses for the connected refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential areas.
The costs for the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility varies from the council office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every tenant wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for a while.
In fact, the administration does not find private houses.
It doesn’t work until now, it’s dependent on private apartments, Deuschle says.
Therefore, municipal apartments need to be cleansed, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done with apartments alone.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are stages, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
“More places would be good,” Regine customer reports.
Many work in the building or help householders, doing non-profit work - and that is motivated and very well, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is “no employment therapy”.
But activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, Deuschle and the customer say.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So you need offers such as sports, contacts with local people and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
The administration and volunteers are also involved.
It is crucial for the refugees to feel like they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can make sense of time, for example, with language courses.
Whoever develops the feeling that he can help no one in Urbach, must not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "People with whom nothing goes."The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
It’s all a ‘mother’ task.
A difficult question: Are the two, after the recent events, afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
“No,” says Regine Customer very clearly, “what some may call naive.” A restrictive risk can and does not want to exclude it.
The assistants are aware.
These incidents are also a matter of refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins would bring them completely in search.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Customer.
Many people would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main and volunteer at the site and in the region have to look for activities.
They are always in the background that a new strike of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a border?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
In fact, it is unfair to put helpers on the site.
“In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the urbanists are already pushed to integrate the previous people reasonably.
There are about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated as there are no simple answers.
