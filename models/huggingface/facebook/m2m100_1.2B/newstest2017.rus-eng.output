28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Center
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine someone who would want to hurt him, noting, “Finally, things went well with him.”
"The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galizia," the San Francisco forensic examination bureau said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death was classified as a murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galizia, told ABC's KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, a former Boston delivery line cook, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
“We are a small team that works like a friendly family and will miss him very much,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galizia said that Frank had been staying in hostels at first, but lately, “Finally, his business was going well.”
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galizia said he couldn’t imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with the family has always been to prepare a meal for us, to prepare a dinner for us,” said Luis Galícia.
He never wanted to get involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who sailed by the stream.
"With all the bad things that happen to this world, it was that unlimited diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information is requested to call the SFPD Hotline at the number 415-575-4444.

Italy’s public debt increased to record levels
Italy’s public debt in June 2016 exceeded 2,248 trillion euros.
The central bank of the country said that this amount is a historic high, reports RIA Novosti.
The previous negative record was set in May of this year.
At that time, the amount of public debt reached 2,228 trillion euros.
In the first half of the year, Italy’s debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.

Scientists have discovered an animal that can live 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland polar shark, which can live about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a significant role in the longevity of sharks plays low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
The female shark reaches sexual maturity by 150 years.
Previously, it was believed that the longest of all vertebrate animals lived the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenland whale.
The oldest individual known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Should I go to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the sanatorium Olga Boguch.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium and resort rest is necessary for us not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get recommendations from a doctor on how to live, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" - this is an important signal of the body, it is not worth waving off.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Stress affects about 90% of visitors.
Moreover, it is most affected by people from large cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself a rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age while staying in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with your children, you won’t have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programs are provided, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, special diets, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in the sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide the necessary conditions for infants and provide the services of an experienced babysitter.
The mild winter, long summer, abundance of sunny days per year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So you should not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out in the room and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially people of mature age.
The main feature of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region, of course, are therapeutic mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects different body systems.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, overall mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effects.
The same effect has the water "Slavyanovskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he chooses less salty water because the salts hold the fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires observance of the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in the sanatoriums are available and various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What kinds of healing, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, clay dirt from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resorptive, immunomodulating effect.
These are healthy walks on individually prepared routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, salmon-lacrimal baths, depending on what your doctor will prescribe.
prolong the fruit.
What to do to keep the harvest until the end of the season?
Tells Yulia Belopukhova, an agronom and a landlord.
It is time for high-growth tomatoes to arrange a haircut: remove new herbs, cut cuttings, remove all the leaves until the pre-last brush with fruits and flowers with small bandages - they will not have time to mature.
All tomatoes regardless of the "constitution", as well as pepper and strawberries are fed with zolno-superphosphate extract, processed with biopreparations (Mature - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, Immunocytofit - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocide, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer, it is worth using only copper cuprose, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
The last watering of plants.
Long-plated cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wallpaper so that the lower, naked part of the stems (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, water with warm water and a solution of zirconia, pour the stems 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruit yield: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the night cold, install an arc with a covering material above the bed.
During the day, keep the plant open and close after sunset.
Signs of end.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia coming out of the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive dynamic - in the second quarter, the GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
On the stabilization of the situation recently also stated the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
A slow growth ahead.
According to the experts of the Central Bank of Russia, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
“The index assessment of Russia’s GDP indicates that the recession is behind, and the slow growth of the economy is ahead,” the Bank of Russia bulletin “What Trends Speak About” said.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter was raised to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline of GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified decline in GDP was 0.2% from the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within the range of 0-0,15", - cited the representative of the mayor of RIA Novosti.
The slowdown in the decline of the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that the “done has passed.”
Among other markers indicating signs of national economic revival, Bloomberg calls the rise in demand for electricity and rail transportation a revival of business.
If you make an adjustment to the fact that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus-minus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality", - explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR Broker.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, in August since the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy”, – emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April in Russia there is an increase in the volume of industrial production.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of fall of foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics are also demonstrated by the situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has decreased to 5.4%.
Lower it was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation in the labour market, the question of the real disposable incomes of the population leaves much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8%.
This factor may hinder the economic recovery, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth can also be called tough policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulatorins the rate at 10.5%, which is not the best way to affect the real sector.
A negative factor is the insufficiently high level of investment, which restrains the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it is possible to assume that by the end of the year the rate of the decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0,5% against -3.7% in 2015", - says the analyst of GK Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly established in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and ex-foreigners, then in most cases we are talking about the natives of the countries - former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians perform under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of change of citizenship is different.
Someone’s parents took him to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not withstand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone considered that better conditions will be created abroad for development in the sport.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of the 27-year-old girl is written that her name is Lisa the Red.
But before, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Only four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
If she remained in Russia, she would hardly be able to "shift from the throne" Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be our only compatriot, although formerly, in the sector for jumps with six.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Piroshkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents were evangelical religious propagandists.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to be interested in fighting at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where in the U.S. Fighting Training Center continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
At the World Championship that same year, it was a victory.
Before that, she, by the way, managed to win silver at the 2010 world championship.
It was bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first became acquainted with synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon, the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her studies.
Soon she was already in the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christina Shaldibina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl artistic gymnastics overseas.
Until then, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth national team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - led the star-banded team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artists" is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who is for the national team of Germany.
Anna was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
Soon she already represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Jana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in the personal first place.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of the Volgograd Sports School.
Naturally, in Iceland she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, IRA is still trained in Russia - specifically coming to the homeland, so as not to lose skill.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in personal multi-fighting.
Information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space is extremely few.
For a very long time, Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - it was even the country's record on the distance of 200 meters batterfly.
In 2015, she obtained Swiss citizenship and began playing under a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance - 14th place in the complex squad 4×100.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavurt has managed to become a three-time winner of the European championships, the champion of Russia, the master of the sport of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented wrestler disappeared from the sports battlefields.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, in his homeland is known even less than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to engage in sports gymnastics.
It has not achieved significant successes at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualifications on parallel slides.
But for New Zealand, even entering the Olympic Games in sports gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her classes of synchronous swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014 at the European Championship in Berlin, the girl took the 6th place in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kruiter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
In the same year he won the youth world championship.
A year later, Crooter also won gold at the Youth Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitry is engaged in jumping in length and triple jumping.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavurt, who after long appearances for Russia has decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Skills of Krasnoyarsk, and in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the national team of the USSR on volleyball Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of his son Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player of the planet.
He decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze prize winner of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and fell with his family at the height of the war.
Ten years later, his parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but this northern country was not reached - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zalimhan continued to learn free struggle.
He soon won the world championship among juniors, and later qualified for participation in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tournament.
And again the free struggle, and again the former Russian.
This time it will be about the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, - about Taymuraz Freev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently he plays for the national team of that country.
Before that, the 30-year-old athlete had time to mark high results in Russia.
He became a bronze winner of the country's championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not falling into the national team, Taymuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Machachkala, - Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been Canada's champion three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among the youth.
In 2015, Biarslav won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to the governor V. Kondratyev, "the Cossacks need to be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They must grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossacks.
But for now, this work seems to me to be conducted formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive accumulated earlier at a qualitatively new level, I will be pleased.
If everything rushes and you don’t know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The public sector continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There are attacks on funds allocated for the needs of the communal sphere from budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, exaggerated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of civil society.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid energy companies more than 170 million rubles.
Recently, the Prosecutor’s Office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of the inclusion of unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (supplies cold water) were invested 4 million rubles. for renting cars at a price higher than the market.
There are many such examples in the country.
The people give for the "communal" the last money, and pay properly, according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused of several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of income obtained by criminal means, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, who was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually performed, but paid.
The businessmen simply returned him most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent them on their needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Machinations Makarov, unfortunately, is typical for Russia.
A wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who appropriated the money of citizens, has gone through the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial continues over A. Kochan, by the way, also a former deputies of the city council, who is accused of mocking for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 he established 6 managing companies and established 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contractual work for the UK, the other two played the role of cash centers, that is, took money from the population.
However, the energetists A. Kochan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, his loved one.
Judging in the field is quite difficult.
Things are not excited, they are delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvrotnev, executive director of the company "Zhkh Control".
We don’t have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
Specialists, including judges, are also few.
Lawyers themselves admit that the housing law in the universities is paid very little attention.
The refusal to initiate criminal cases, the wreckage in the course of investigations are also spoken in the Prosecutor General.
Of the 3,5 thousand crimes under investigation in 2015, less than half were brought to court.
For the rest, the investigation took a lengthy character, and every fifth was suspended due to the non-identification of the accused.
Often shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are written down by them on gaps in the current legislation.
The law exists, but the investigators are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeits - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In five months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
What is the falsification of the protocol of the resident assembly?
This means: the change of management of the house, financial and other issues are bypassing the opinions of owners.
And this also means that the market of housing and utility services can not break through normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "doy" the population.
It turns out, tenants in minus, small and medium-sized too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the whole state, - assured Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property.
This work is now being actively carried out.
This is not just a single action – it is a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not in all regions the situation is so sad.
Especially in the capital, scandals do not smell.
Why are there no such scandals in the sphere of housing in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government demonstrated iron will and set the order, - told "AIF" Anatoly Select, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Counter-Corruption.
I mean the personal issue, and legislative amendments, and legal education.
The managing companies have been closely supervised, and they have all passed through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and appeals of residents, and response measures are posted on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many not only pay monthly receipts, but carefully watch what is written there, how the house is kept.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource-supply and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of tariffs for housing and utilities services - because a significant part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably all this together explains the quiet situation in Moscow.
Does this depend on the will of the regional authorities?
Per the unwilling should change the place of work?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to abandon friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum to the United States by proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said this in a speech to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged the Americans to refrain from supporting the “terrorist organization of fethlahists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey that calls on the United States to change its position.
Experts believe that the division in Turkey’s relations with the West is growing more and more and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
Sooner or later America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO (Terrorist Fethullahist Organization).
Either the organizing coup FETO, or the democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice," Erdogan's address, which was heard in Ankara on Wednesday evening, quoted by the Anatolian Agency.
The President of Turkey once again, but harder, demanded that the United States comply with his demand, which he voiced for the first time immediately after the suppression of the uprising.
Recall that in the night of July 16 in Turkey high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority in the country, as well as attempted the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the uprising was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people were suspected, among whom, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan supporters also admitted that the coup could be directly involved with the Americans.
The United States denied all claims, refusing to extradite Gülen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement of representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the president of Turkey - he insists on his own and also makes demands to his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels names the date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkey's EU Minister Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorism law, as demanded by the EU, would endanger Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel urged Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open its borders to migrants in order to a visa relief with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement of the head of the foreign ministry of Turkey Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement on Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish Foreign Minister has not ruled out that the country will consider leaving the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from him.
The decision to increase defence cooperation with Russia is not a move against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sphere, import missiles,” Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us and we have started looking for others," he said.
Experts believe that all this speaks of Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Yevgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now playing his game and can not go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West, both from a business and military point of view (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance it whileining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this post," the expert explained.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensations, on the demand for a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the United States) he will be pressured.
“Recep Erdogan will face deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governance of the country, and so on,” Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexei Mukhin admits that the president of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes advantageous for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance on Russia and sought favor in the West in every way.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of boat diplomacy.
Having found himself between two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
According to him, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States ceases to support Gülen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US to help control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
This was stated by the head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova.
Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally conducts.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not by chance that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, are declaring that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, the relations with Israel are settled, there is an active political interaction with Iran", - explained AIF.ru Glasova, assuming that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the start of the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that Turkey began to very actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the position of zero problems with its neighbors.
There have now been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey’s positions both on the regional and international arena,” the expert said.
Glazova believes that Turkey’s return to the former relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, but the question is now whether the EU will start to respond to Turkey, which can open its borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young physicians strike: calls for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors have appealed to the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new labor contract.
The British Medical Association’s Junior Physicians Committee (JDC) is about to ask for its full advice to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the deal on the employment agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government continued to “hardly silence” about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the head of the JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and called for formal re-negotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The controversy has led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA’s senior physician, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to revoke the agreed terms of employment recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to take during the meetings ahead of a vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of the bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a steady impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tense, and he barely radiated warmth even to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, has repeatedly spoken about his “dear friend” Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was disastrous.
Mr. Putin broke out in anger, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a stunning, total offensive on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be held to be guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior leaders that Mr. Erdogan’s own family had profited from illegal oil trade from areas in Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting happened only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the advantages of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost overthrown from his post last month during a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit heavily — especially the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, will feel relief when flights are finally resumed.
They put at the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as was said in the report in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to a coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged discontent with the turtle pace of EU accession talks and Mr. Putin’s move – who seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support to elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit at this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are uniting forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Per it speaks for itself that after three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they didn’t even touch the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering questions about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language on Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and considering the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it’s definitely better for the two leaders to at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of a back office, according to the bank’s chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship to international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including its external headquarters and stock exchange, will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and staff to Invernesshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and one in which our staff will be employed because we are now becoming more a bank of brands.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their populations, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sponsorship of the sport.
"This is the right time for us to move bank brands, as basically (we asked ourselves) how are we focusing on improving bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you’re seeing a lot of change.
We can return those brands again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Priestry
Dettori Spraying Champagne After a Newmarket Doll Leads It to 3,000 Victories
Joke Frankie Dettori achieved his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second night winner on his home trail – the Pride trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Joker to reach this outstanding mark in smooth races.
He follows Sir Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Ideri and Willy Carson.
Three-time joke champion Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, “It’s something special.”
I’m very excited because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big secular event, it’s not a Royal Ascot – it’s an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am free of affairs and very unpretentious.
Dettori receives applause when he brings predisposition after victory
Two jokes have reached such a mark in obstacle racing: Joker champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has had more than 4,300 wins in a record career.
Leicester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jokes of modern times and it’s not surprising that he has reached that mark that so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical cleverness that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn’t just a weekend joker and big racing!
And if serious, Frankie has been bringing winners to the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but moreover, he’s an incredible Joker.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a fast jump from a horse
From fast finishes to fast jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
There were ups and downs.
Many big racing winners, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while — Dettori previously said he would like to continue to compete, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses head of administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted close circle for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed as a representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not name the reason.
Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Weino, was appointed as his successor.
Mr. Weino, 44, a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later he was head of the administration of the protocol of the president and the apparatus of the government, reports the Kremlin website.
During his appointment, he told Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are performed.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his dismissal and recommended that Weino replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
It was a move that stunned Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, the two men said that the head of the administration resigned at his own will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, this has convinced few here – especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of some struggle for power?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement – that a man who was once promoted as a potential president suddenly wanted to control Russia’s environmental policy – was met with tremendous skepticism.
In comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me this very difficult position, even, you can say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out, I was the head of the administration of the president for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency after only three and a half years.
"Thinking as a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after fight with producer
Gibson was a part of a clash at the shooting of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his removal was announced.
There were creative disagreements and disagreements in opinions.
I regret that this happened,” he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be removed from a show that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to come later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously played the lead role in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love 'Thinking as a Criminal' and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I hoped to be there until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the screenwriters, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly the best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish Landed in Banff Garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sandstones left by a water shrimp.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, put a shot of this spectacle in the Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensbury Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fifa
The £1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern passage and the Queensbury Crossing viaduct, meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four switches between the "weavers of the canvas", which are now approaching completion near all three pillars of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 watts of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensbury Crossing.
We are all witnessing the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the switching between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuous operation using extremely precise assembly admissions.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas the concrete coating is cast in Rosite today, which means that the whole canvas is ready to rise to place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first switch on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this switching represents the most modern building art.
After the last section of the road was installed and connected to the expanding road of the North Pillar, we had to close the remaining gap on the northern side, or on the shore side.
This was done by stretching the viaduct of the north approach 700 millimeters south.
It was a large and at the same time very elegant operation.
The viaduct, which is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was to be raised at a slope of about 3%.
Elegant because the assumptions the team worked on were tiny – just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'have been lucky to stay alive'
Three men were ‘lucky to stay alive’ after being thrown out of a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfr Bay.
Three men tried their best to sail to a safe place while their ship continued to move.
“We saw their boat rolling around next to them and anticipated the worst,” said Vince Jones, a pilot of the Moelfre rescue boat.
"Fortunately, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third 60-year-old man was found weary and stuck in a buff without a lifeguard.
All of them were taken to the shore rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Jones said: "Three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but it somehow separated from the man driving the boat when it turned over.
Someone guarded those guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teens and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint for many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go removes people from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Time in the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and recently smartphones.
So great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I’m, of course, referring to the adventure that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (later giving rise to a series of cartoons, game cards, and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all this lost its previous relevance a little before this new game became available in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how it works?
In a few words, players with smartphones are going to look for Pokémon that are traced by GPS and, when detected, can be 'photographed' (through screenshots on your phone) or 'catched'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the hunting hobby, separating themselves from the couches for search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the “ordinary” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people tracked by it who performed 30-minute exercise daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing levels.
Many health care campaigns that persuade people to “find 30 minutes”, “rise up from the couch” and “be active every day” have failed to find a response because most health messages are boring and are spoken by people who look unhappy.
The importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and still a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the charm of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, three health fundamentals are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on hunting.
As usual, there are boring borings that are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might knock on the door.
and what?
The breakthrough happened.
After all, despite the fact that apps for smartphones like Fitbit could have previously tracked our physical activity, they did not give us a reason to exercise, as this game gives.
The novelty will arrive, and use will weaken with time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simona Bailes wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget about pressure.
Forget about the mess.
Simona Bailes is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on a jump.
Unforced on the barrel.
Amazing on the floor.
Amazing everywhere.
And finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the championship title in absolute championship on Thursday, placing a gap between herself and the rest of the world on a compelling demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62,198 was in sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Eli Rysman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafa.
Bayles from the United States is performing on a gymnastic barrel during the final of the women’s individual absolute championship in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
She became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the absolute championship title and the fifth overall, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, and any time.
She was upset when her final overall score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes such as Michael Phelps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Bayles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals – including 10 gold medals – with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
One final test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bailes and the rest of the field, but between her and a load of overwhelmed expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals would be seen as an unjustified expectation.
Simona Bailes of the United States, left, and Eli Riceman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women’s individual absolute championship in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bayles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retired national team coordinator Martha Caroli.
While Bailes insisted that she never looked back in the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not exactly the case.
Part of her free-exercise program — one that includes her branded passage — is set on Latin American music that would fit right like home on the street just outside of the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother as a beginner and opened by the mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was the coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single absolute championship race since the summer of 2013 – a lucky runway that must last as long as Bailes wants it.
Despite the fact that Mustafa got a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastics and free exercises – where Bayles defends the title of world champion – are in a row.
She again came forward with 15,433 on the barrel and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Riceman gently embraced her as they waited for the final bill — a pure formality — and tears appeared around the bright red with white and blue eyeswear of Bailes when the plan she once recorded in the album for the cuts came true.
Riceman’s performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared the third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafa on the tailbreak.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother", was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise captured by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bailes, the viral tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the case of serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed during the deadliest attack in the first Phoenix serial killer case in the last decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Angela Rochel Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked on the roadway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from a gun standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he escaped on another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple murder, apparently, was not the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether he was linked to four previous attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over the course of four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard KPHO, a CBS subsidiary, told CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan of the late 1990s, a black BMW of the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Alice, 33, was hospitalized with wounds and later died.
The 31-year-old Liner and her daughter Alice, Malia, were killed on the spot.
A witness told the police that there was nothing unusual in the fact that they sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shelling, aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder and believed to have been done by a serial killer.
Investigators found the guilds and pulled the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Picasso loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picasso, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was – I can’t do it.
I will not be able to do that.
I did not sign it.
That, in fact, is not true – of course you sign up for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized medical institution.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were still doing that,’” Pixito explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But it slowly passes through some stages.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund invented for “Please sing to me.”
“We’re teaching him the sign language,” Pixiuto told CBS News.
But it’s not just the usual gesture language — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur as a result of a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as in Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is still too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picasso recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I was always saying what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still does not know.
I didn’t really ask for a lifetime forecast because I didn’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivo has encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
becomes better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state before Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid has already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were received for transport for high water, boats and sacks of sand.
Steele said that only the parish of Tanjipahoa asked for tens of thousands of sacks of sand.
Flood hazard remains in force until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The meteorological service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could invade the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood-warning duty lasted until Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Day Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a record flood level last weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said the flooding downstream in the Assenshen parish is a threat as these bloated rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tickfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue workers were still pulling people out of the flooding in the Amit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among the rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly overnight.
He said that another man who lives nearby had warned him.
“We woke up and the water continued to rise,” Hansford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest stream she'd seen in 48 years of living here.
Hansford said that he and all his family members have disabilities, and he is the only one who knows how to swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with the help of an army truck and transported them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they hid on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding "is spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was saturated with rainfall from the middle.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to rescue work in the Tanjipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities said.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reports that Tanjipahoa’s adviser told about 200 flooded houses.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooding.
Parish chairman Robbie Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets from the high water.
Shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to go home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the parish town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sacks of sand were available to be handed out to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and.
"The last major flood we've had was in March," said city governor Lacy Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacy, said the storm continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Tausson said, “and it’s still flying to the ground.”
Mahage Brown, 6 years old, 'shoot by bullets', remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia
Police report that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording the second shooting in a six-year-old in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his forehead, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a big hit, his little body was shattered by bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just cannot believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to the first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-olds isly in critical condition; two other victims werely in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a shooting between several armed men.
Guilds from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, stiffened the place of action.
It seemed to be a long battle.
There were guilds on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it seems, there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shooting,” said the police captain of Philadelphia Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and police arely looking through surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in the hand by a bullet on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She is recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team, and for several reasons.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And the second: in this team the key role is played by three gymnastes: Simona Bailes, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many blue girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Rysman, who is a Jewish woman, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It is powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Bailes, Douglas and Lori Hernandez performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuous gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual absolute first.
And team colleague Eli Riceman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn’t look like it in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is Martha Caroli's last year of training.
But in reality gymnastics is a expensive sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents, paying for training, equipment, travel, fitness, contribution to competitions, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get the most out of their workouts, and it’s a costly and long-term obligation for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simona Bayles, and Meggie Honey, coach of Lori Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem to over 15,000 city youths (mostly black and Latin Americans) and educated national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that’s great.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of Women’s Power in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors announce new strikes after Jeremy Hunt rejects proposal
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing on the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the agreement, saying that the NHS was “on no one’s ground” and any subsequent delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work activities at night and on weekends to improve service during out-of-school hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Junior Physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will nurture the existing workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all physicians fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is on end.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the government.
And that’s despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unambiguous that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike in late April brought about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses to be postponed, while nurses and consultants were attracted to ensure replacement of doctors on the pick-up line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing on the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants a better weekend pay for 54,000 junior doctors that will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “Strikes little or nothing, but put pressure on already working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and discomfort to patients, nurses and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have talked to the Junior Physicians Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Employees hoped that ongoing positive support on other important topics such as staff distribution, training flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition costs, mutual recognition of curricula, academic leave and gender pay gap in medicine were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health intended to abide by the conditions reached by WMA in November, February and May.
A drug of 2 pounds a day could reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to take the drug for £2 a day after authorities have recommended giving it to more people and for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor anticoagulant reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE supervisory service of the UK National Health Service advised people to give it for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
However, now the NICE supervisory service of the UK National Health Service has advised people to give it for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
A heart attack happens to approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them experience another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks into pieces, it can cause a thrombus that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move along the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already suffered one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold as Brilique, reduces the risk by making thrombosis less likely.
The NICE Instruction Draft, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By pre-recommending Ticagrelor, we are delighted to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the effectiveness and safety of TICAGRELOR – especially the risk of bleeding – is limited after three years, the draft instructions do not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
PC ownership culture allows for falsification of vote counts in Muslim districts to flourish
Former mayor of Tower Hamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to blindness, which has turned into widespread falsification of voting counts in Muslim communities, according to information from a devastating government report released today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has been criticized by police, election observers and the city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations because of “excessive sensitivity about race and religion.”
A former local community secretary, now an anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on a religious basis was so strong that police need to be allowed to lay boundaries outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take ID cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For now, voters only have to indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests applying unwashable ink on people’s fingers when they give up their ballots, in order to exclude anyone from voting twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street following a polling scandal at Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the current mayor of the city, Luftur Rahman, had to be removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, “led his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of believing Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes raised doubts or were the result of personification when a person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concerns about mail voting fraud in which senior members of the Muslim communityly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, on the photo, made several recommendations on cleaning up the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
The report said: “There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote on the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were concerns that ... government institutions closed their eyes to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ about ethnicity and religion.”
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations on cleaning up the system, including removing political activists from working with voting mail bulletins to stop "collecting votes."
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration and privileges fraud.
The option is considered to require voters to present an identity card before voting.
Use unwashable ink on people’s fingers as soon as they throw their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic nationality checks to ensure that people are eligible to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with filled off-season voting and envelopes with mail voting.
Give the police authority to set boundaries around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation in accordance with the People's Act of 1983.
It is illegal to photograph in polling stations.
Require only English to be used in polling stations (except for Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the cabin one by one.
Sir Eric fiercely attacks the city police, stating that it’s “surprising” that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower-Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for the sake of the bar" of the electoral registration departments of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s Tower Hamlet court ruling was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about cycling analogues Kate and other celebrities twins of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy about French cyclist Polyn Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than superficial resemblance to the Hollywood stars.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. male archer team member Brady Allison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the double Kate on the bike trail, many people online rushed to point out how a particular scooter could be the twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. male archer team member Brady Ellison caused the hurricane on Twitter after images appeared of him looking frighteningly like the Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, the stranger learned about the social media madness and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, except for the vegetation on the face," Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s an attractive guy, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012, will undoubtedly be pointed out even more this year: the striking resemblance between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafa, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be the exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star of Horus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is the "sports version" of the actor "Start"
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist swimmer from Russia Julia Efimov can boast not only equally burned skin and light hair as the actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like "the sporty version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, on the right, have the same shapes of face and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to disclose his enthusiasm that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the American football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful wide smile, which resembles the smile of "Be successful" star Gabriel Union.
Olympic commentator at CBC apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
The analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place at the finish of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on the women's 4x200 m free style squad upset on Wednesday CBC viewers in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started like a smell” and “died like a pig” while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final 4x200m women’s squad in free style.
You could hear how McDonald, who was attracted to the CBC commentary team to “diluce her colour,” said, “This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby.”
Too excited, it started smelling, it died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, who is 14, sailed the second stage of the squad at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the backwardness from China.
Audiences across Canada reacted quickly on the net after being shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmet McFarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC speaker really just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’???”
This idiot didn’t realize they were still on the air.”
About Ai Yangyang from China in the final of the women's 4x200 m squad in a free style said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl knocked out the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately hit Byron McDonald, with many calling for his dismissal
Twitter users didn’t stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: “Nothing to #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who conducted the CBC broadcast, apologized in direct for McDonald's commentary, saying, "We apologize for the commentary about the swimming performance being broadcast."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words, we’re sorry it happened.”
The BBC ended up apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
Commentary friend Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The TV network has also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
Last night we acted promptly to apologize to our live viewers and our subscribers on social media.
Let’s make it clear, Byron’s comments referred to the swimmer’s performance, not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on his identity.
"I would like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's squad," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
“I was talking about the swimmer’s performance, not about her personally.”
“Of course, there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.”
Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly spotted underwear in the middle of the store
The shoppers didn’t know where to look when a woman showed up naked to look at her trousers on the store floor in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she looked at how she looked in them, tightened them and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Falkston.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Falkston, where a woman wrapped her tricycle trousers before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after copying the underwear the mysterious woman again "dressed up and went out of the store without buying anything."
She said, “People couldn’t believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a pair of trousers from the vitrine, removed her own socks and trousers and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find a sheltered place to do that – she just stood there, shamelessly.”
“Everyone got out when she took off her trousers again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided there was nothing she would like here, dressed up again and went out.
“It doesn’t seem that she cared about who was watching her, or that she thought of a man who would eventually buy those cowards she was looking at.”
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone is going to take home the cowards that someone else has already worn and they haven't been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove those items from the sale after she left — and so much better."
“I don’t want to come home with a new pair of feminine cowards and find that another woman wore them and took them off, and they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that happened in our store in Falkston on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks Using Krav-Maga
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Crawmaga Federation in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they approach from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you tightly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follow your knee into your ankle, and while the attacker bends from pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a trunk and go back, holding the weapon pointed at him.
For the armed, suitable in front, the method of execution is similar - take your body off the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it out so that the villain could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip, before moving back and targeting it.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery – unless you’re a crawler – is to give your cash back.
For a guide, traveler Jan Wright spends his tongue through the dirtyest places in Europe
A British traveler has tested his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of the dirtyest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Travel book host and author Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spoke over the euro banknote, the Circus Piccadilly, the toilet wash button in the train, and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before scratching each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was entering.
But the experiment, which was supposed to be a film called "The Traveler-Lizun Guide to the Inner Force", gave some surprising results.
The idea of licking the wash button in a train used by thousands of others can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen drawer.
Thro his trip to Europe, Wright talked to doctors and health workers about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the licking brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public lawns at train stations to the toilet wash button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, “From childhood I was completely careless about my health and I pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.”
He definitely proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His test patch demonstrated the value of a luminometer exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison, just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was more than 4000 units, while the just washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy maker Valio have made a film about a traveler called "The Traveler-Lizun Guide to Inner Strength," which demonstrates the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I’ve smelled in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than this!
I’m not going to lick anything, because it’s disgusting.
"The Traveller-Lizun Guide to Inner Force" was removed together with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Voorenмаа, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming that ended with the idea of “let’s call Jan.”
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Rather than just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we have been able to present consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the film’s director, added: “Let’s say, I would have lost respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.”
Naturally, some of Yan’s things were easier to lick, and some were quite tough.
I’m glad that some of these licking we managed to film.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents associated acidic milk bacteria exclusively with good stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent said they ate, at least occasionally, foods containing added acidic milk bacteria.
A family of hooliganists destroyed Saltash, the Cornwall municipal house, on the eve of the expulsion
A family of hooligans left their municipal house with losses of £50,000 after they were expelled for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evacuated from the property, shocked housing cooperative officials found the property in a state requiring repair.
The walls were left with grizzly holes, half were opened, garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were defiled with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a resident at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that he would not be saved.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live that way.
There are a lot of things to weigh because this property is likely to be known as a not very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys a bad reputation and their name enjoys a bad reputation.
The couple has three sons who live in the property from time to time, and the police report that the realm of family-induced horror included street battles with baseball beats, intimidating residents of nearby neighborhoods, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, quarrels and blasphemy.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which could be demolished, found old garbage
Floor boards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw fighting on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly expelled her and her partner from home this week after they were granted an extended 11-week period for voluntary departure.
The expulsion was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said their lives had turned into a real hell.
One said, “They didn’t worry about anyone.”
We’ve lived with them for 20 years and it’s always been bad.
The number of times we have seen the police here is incredible.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.”
We got up because it was so quiet here – we weren’t used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood security group, said the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police.
The garbage and old toys were scattered below the grown side of the municipal house.
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant has failed to take any responsibility for her and her family’s behavior, as displacement is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying for her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police and the members of the Devon and Cornwall communities who courageously acted to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after displacement
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the trash that surrounds the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of hemp, as well as weights, corresponding accessories and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after acknowledging himself guilty of possession of class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay for the tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the rooms of the house were spotted with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evacuate tenants who do not obey the rental rules.
Angela Crowe, from the police of Devon and Cornwall, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the accusation of the prosecutor, as well as those who are hurt by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be permitted by the police of Devon and Cornwall, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came into horror when a low-flying military aircraft, almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love to lay in the sun, feared for their lives.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force that he was performing a training flight, but insisted that there was no risk to safety.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying aircraft spiked over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a touch distance from hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resting people jumped on their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned about the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but were unable to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the city of Aveiru in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of a few holidaymakers who posted a video of the shocking flight on social media, said: “It flew very low twice, and there was a moment at which it seemed to break.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and I swear there was a feeling that the plane was about to crash on me.”
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was performing a training flight to detect fishing vessels offshore and was forced to descend so low as that was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires have damaged the mainland of Portugal and also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility.
The aircraft was performing a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for catering for more than a year, but most cafés and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the food sector in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
Rospotrebnadzor's business checks on compliance with these norms in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But for now officials write out fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulations in general will cost the enterprise 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles - for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account and prevents risks when working with food products was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada, and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating in the territory of the TS.
The company had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement appeared in the TS Technical Regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
We, unfortunately, have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food manufacturers, not to restaurants, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Cereteli.
Everyone is trying to recover the lost.
Expected resumption of charter flights to Turkey - late August - early September.
But they will not create an agitating demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking for the authorization of charters.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting quality and affordable sea leisure is insoluble, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities are already booked by the end of September," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter ships in August will not significantly affect the already-established demand for Russian marine tourist products.
As in the North-West Regional Branch of the Russian Tourism Union (RST), if the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding when the charters will be renewed yet, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly construct programs and agree with the airlines on the necessary flights on the destination,” says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Branch of the Russian Federation.
According to him, the possible renewal of charters is good news, but it will not affect the placement of forces in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spend a vacation in other countries.
During the season, tourists are mostly purchased by single travellers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap trips," said Valeria Rosenthal, general manager of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth counting on the adventure - the majority of trips are already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no need to wait.
“For Turkey, launching the charters now is a rehearsal for next season,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season,” said Valeria Rubtsova.
The tax code provides for the exemption from compensation payments established by the legislation within the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.

Moscow "Gazstroybank" remained without the license of the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the license to carry out banking operations from the credit organization “Gazstroybank”, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC "GASTROYBANK" carried out a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks undertaken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank’s assets have resulted in the credit institution having grounds for implementing measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in conducting questionable transit transactions.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for the period of validity until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
JSC "GASTROYBANK" is a participant in the deposit insurance system.
The payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On Insurance of Deposits of Individuals in Banks of the Russian Federation" is provided for in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles. in combination per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the report, by the size of assets of JSC AKB "GASTROYBANK" on August 1, 2016 occupied 335 place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, hasly been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akundi said her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News on Thursday.
Sultane was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“We can only hope that the only advantage of all this – as a tomb and a will to others – is that these are the risks we are talking about when traveling to the war zone – to discourage people ever from making the same choice,” Akundi said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family said she married ISIS militant in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as candidate for Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reed says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland’s approval, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person who can replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
Reed's spokeswoman later said he hadn't spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland, and was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team’t want to “drop the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeal.
Reed said that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "shelters" and "supporters" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not suitable for the position.
Treats claims that erotic calendars are for 'women as well as men'
Treats magazine has partnered with photographer David Bellmer to unveil a calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli’s 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muse.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Obviously he thinks the calendar too.
“We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classic naked figure where women, just like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it’s a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscovites will be distributed memoirs about unfair online shops.
In Moscow, they are going to release a monument that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is that specialists of the department are preparing a memorial that will help citizens to choose the correct online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative framework, rules for delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
In the appendix will be given recommendations on how to correctly make a claim and so on", - said in Rospotrebnadzor.
The memorial is currently being completed.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor for Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute to the Moscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement in which it named the name of the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in Crimea.
Ukrainian and Russian citizens who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Yevgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtai Andrei Romanovich.
“All of them give confessional testimony,” the statement said.
Earlier, the resident of the Zaporozhye region Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt at the interrogation.
FAS has fined Google with 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles.
The fine for Google for violation of the anti-monopoly legislation amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future,” said Deputy head of the FAS Alexei Dotenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS established that Google supplies to manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in the territory of Russia, the Google Play app store only provided that the device will be installed other applications of the corporation.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Article 10 of the Federal Law “On Protection of Competition” (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a favorable effect on our consumers.
The law “On protection of competition” must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations including,” said Elena Zaeva, head of the Office of Regulation of Communications and Information Technologies of the Russian Federation.
The agency suspected 16 Russian stores of conspiracy.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
The network of stores "New Book" has been fined for the sale of the book Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide", reports the city news agency "Moscow".
As in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
The Ostankinsky district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the management of Rospotrebnadzor.
A source in The New Book confirmed that it is a work of Stace Kramer.
In March this year, it was that the largest bookstores in Moscow were checked for the presence of the book "50 days before my suicide".
The evening of Ernst the Unknown is held in Moscow.
In Moscow will be held the evening of memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 in the Central House of Letters.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to remember him in their homeland,” the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
The evening was invited by close friends of the Unknown, including poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of Pushkin IMI Irina Antonova, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, Head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pichatnikov.
Earlier it was that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown plan to hold a panic on the sculptor in New York, presumably until August 14.
End consumer of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Single men of middle age love vinyl.
And until you have rushed to clog the comment section with gross insults under the nickname of Non-Male, this claim follows from factual data.
According to YouGov, the much discussed revival of plates is due not to the boom among the two-thousand generation who want to penetrate the novelty of the material subject, but the nostalgia of the middle ages.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of amateur gathering – it has an emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56 percent versus 53 percent) and enjoy loneliness (69 percent versus 66 percent).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked through the center of the bustling Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and bullishly gesturing before stopping, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, “Yes, let’s see.”
So let’s see.
While Socho’s heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, and Paperchase shops now flooded buildings once held by independent sellers – a few music stores with fantastic professionals are still left.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I’m close to different people in some of these stores and trying to estimate their age and emotional attitude through observation.
Native to Glasgow, Stewart, 55, who I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for half a day to have a meeting, and walking around the shops to take a few hours.
He is a collector, I ask.
“I think yes,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, depicted above (he emailed me a photo, I didn’t chase him home), go lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles comes partly from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they just came out, and buy back items he sold when he was young and on the ground.
“Many of the things I’m acquiring are the late 60s, the early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy the records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding, “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink a lot.
This is my deficiency.
Wes, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of the media noise, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy back their old records.
Judging from the conversations I’ve had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among the figures of the revival of vinyl of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional importance of the records?
It’s enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society for people with similar views.
According to Wes, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to get away with the constancy of familiar envelopes for plates, items that awaken memories of a restless youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling up an emptiness or possessing material things as a kind of reassurance,” Wes says.
Since I am a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
This is an easy way to take your head.
“We are like their social workers!” said a colleague from the recording shelf.
An ICM survey in April revealed that 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month have not listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this stage of the news reporting, I would probably look seriously confused, the shelf with Bosanov’s collections.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data counting: three middle-aged men) noticed.
"Someone came recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More composition, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player.”
These are younger people, not the elderly, they are a little less than twenty, who only get acquainted with this.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire vinyl floor, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who are over 70, tourists who photograph, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores – the latest synth and sexy pop of Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns – it’s nice to see the diversity in their customers.
None of them look lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records available for sale.
She looks at goods, not spends money.
She doesn’t earn much, she says, so collecting records isn’t a very suitable option.
It is expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ...”, she plunges into dreams with a breath filled with love.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Fashionists.
While I create the illusion that I’m looking at the jeans shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley player.
On the left is the staircase, the wall of which is mounted with records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, compulsory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking — because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real artistic vinyl.
But considering that any attracting attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and sending several customers to the Soho depths for a while, there’s hardly anything to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends the most money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings show that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl enthusiasts who exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work in schools or offices.
But they obviously don’t spend a Thursday morning walking around the record stores on Berwick Street, leaving the records and avoiding the gaze of the unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of nothing-suspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark - the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, says the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities stated that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 home-made stores, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple dishes for a few euros in home-made restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture said these sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel the people running the 72 home-made stores, but stated that the problems of the Calais Prefecture "were fully understood".
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said barbecues, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who “lived in extremely unhealthy conditions.”
He said the spaces provided quiet meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was in danger of demolition was the Children's Cafe Jungle Book at the Camp, which works for non-profit purposes and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s café.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure “would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years old.”
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number in the jungle camp has grown to exceed 9,000 - the highest in history - after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
The libraries of the micro-regions invite young freelancers to educational programs.
This week the libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Artist.
The programs are aimed at children’s audiences, so most of them will be held in playful form.
Today, August 10, the library branch No. 2, in the Leningrad district, invites you to a cruise presentation "My town is small".
On August 11 in the library-branch No. 1 will be held the regional study hour "I live in this city, I know this city".

Britain stops on silver in rugby 7 after a Fiji master class allows them to take gold
Britain’s impressive Rugby-7 series was crushingly stopped at the final obstacle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday evening when they were completely defeated by 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave masterclasses in ball ownership, disembarkation, evasion, game support, line run and brute force to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with a not too poor consolation in the form of silver – Britain’s third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Rugby-7 Olympic tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day, could have returned to negatively impact them in the final.
But, in spite of anything, Fiji in this form won the best team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach is Ben Ryan, a former England chef from Wimbledon.
It was a trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one.
These strikes will cause pain, but the progress is surprising.
Fiji started brilliantly, fighting back the British attempts to intercept the ball for fun.
It was like hitting a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 as Osea Colinisaou dive into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Gerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and England barely touched the ball.
The magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell prevented the mountain man Leon Nakarawa from scoring a third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute of Jassa Veremaluya made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clocks ... in the first half.
Vatelmo Ravovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The result was 29-0 in the break.
It looked like the Fiji were born to play rugby-7, while the UK still mastered the craft.
That is largely so.
Britain made a massive half-game replacement, and they seized the Fiji Dam...for all four minutes, which was good on the first half standards until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fiji interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed the attempt for Britain by making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game had long gone along the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the tribunes.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of the approach of Fiji.
Mata William decorated the Fiji cake, which did not need to be decorated, with another attempt in the last seconds.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the UK slightly overtook South Africa in a tense semi-finals of one attempt to each - the difference British realization.
Kyle Brown pulls the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some great leg work broke the line and scored under the bars in the second half.
A brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, the 15-way brother of England’s team, Anthony, secured a victory — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win the windsurfing by a coach's fight against cancer
There will be no more exciting gold on these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two who pulled the veils, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams has always been as long as they were striving for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all, it was their 39th unbeaten performance, again unprecedented.
What we can see, two brilliant athletes slipping on the surface with the elegance of the swan, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold was a battalion of ready-made hands contributing to gradually growing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one that they can operate, and they did.
If they don’t, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your look for the future a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the correct expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to fix quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said a few steps were enough.
This is how it starts.
Rugging in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little longer.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, a captain of the artillery regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said: "I was an emotional ruin this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much I and Helen have worked, and Robin too.
It’s been fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be none, so thank him very much, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very in phase.
Helen called, ‘stay in the process, stay in the process.’
It is very important not to get distracted.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything amazing.
We didn’t expect fireworks today, we just expected to get out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover must be at her wedding next month, on her own with television adventure seeker Steve Beckhol.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited for import into Russia.
The corresponding resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it was published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import some types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country to circumvent the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only in the first quarter of 2016 about 100 tons of banned products were seized from the sale.
The “forbidden” hunt
Rains and storms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
Through the capital region will pass an atmospheric front, which will bring rainfall and lower air temperature.
During the day the air warms up to 25 degrees.
Thus, in the night of Saturday in Moscow places will be a short rain, thunderstorms and winds up to 15 m / s are possible.
During the day, rain is expected with thunderstorms and winds up to 12-17 m / s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
Rainfall is unlikely next week.
The WTO Arbitration Panel has determined that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the organization’s rules.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation," the organization's official website said.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "had a comprehensive character".
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Ukrainian government.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the U.S. behavior in resolving disputed issues in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted by the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members over the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term the South Korean judge, Chang Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
Change of President’s Chief
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has made changes in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino said during the meeting that he considers important anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Experts believe the situation with the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the administration is transparent and understandable and the restructuring will not change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who worked in the presidential administration for a long time, effectively built the activities of the AP, has left.
In his place came the deputy head of the administration Anton Weino - a man who knows the specifics of this work.
Poland says it will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was stated by the vice president of the Polish financial company Bogusław Mażec.
His words are transmitted by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all, we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway,” he said.
Gazprom currently occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 delivered almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% above the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the procurement of PGNIG increased to 49.8% compared with 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, the Polish anti-monopoly agency did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners on the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
A month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas via Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Board of Holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was that Gazprom has not yet planned to take any action in connection with the intention of the Polish side to give up long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year Poles only increased by 42% of gas purchases from the Russian Federation.
Gazprom’s deputy chairman added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG filed a claim to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
The Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure Petr Naimsky said that the Polish authorities decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government’s commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Petro Naimski, said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new LNG supply terminal Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
"Nord Stream-2" provides for the construction of two lines of a marine gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was by the first Deputy Head of SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the corresponding question of journalists, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents affecting security there are not recorded.
Observers monitored what was happening at three passage points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the network appeared a video of the Ufa airport landed in the Ufa airport passenger aircraft Yak-42, which rushed out of the runway for 400 meters and crashed on the left wing.
The video was released by TV channel 360.
The incident occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no injured.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa airport operates as usual.
The Volga Investigative Directorate on Transport of the SCR investigated the cause of the hard landing of the aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN special envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura believes the fact of the incident is undeniable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
The opposition then said that in the area where the Russian military-transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aviation dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a dump.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense accused the opposition group "Harakyat Nur ad-Din al-Zinki" of the incident.
Soon it became known that there were two toxic gas bombs.
This was confirmed by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I smelled gas, my eyes began to burn, it became difficult to breathe," the publication quoted the eyewitness as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the fact of the use of poisonous gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened."
The unacceptable use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Despite the fact that all sides in the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition” in 2015.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its districts is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the evacuation of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in military actions.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered “insufficient to help 2 million civilians who are trapped.”
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser Jan Egelan said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed every week to deliver aid and evacuate sick and wounded from the city.
“We have to send large-scale cargo from a truck column to areas where roads are virtually destroyed and those that are left are mine,” said Mr Egelan. – But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
Russia has opened humanitarian windows in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo – Syria’s second largest city – Russia on August 11 announced the introduction of a three-hour ceasefire regime, which will be in effect daily starting on Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to provide conditions for the delivery to the city of medicines, food and necessities.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to overthrow the military operation and to contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand, four people died.
Several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed and 19 wounded.
The epicenter of the explosions occurred in the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four countries, and no Russians among them.
No terrorist group has yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has rushed to say that the Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the country’s military.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that showed development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanakaroen said.
It is still too early to talk about the targets, he added, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the countries "are confident that they are not connected with international extremist groups."
It is too early to make conclusions, said Mr. Pattaначаrojen.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they are local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of the Queen of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy as one of its top priorities, so the incident is most likely directed against it.
According to the statement of the police general Sitchich Shrisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a half-hour difference.
They were hidden inside trees on bustling streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identities of the other victims are unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the royal police of Thailand, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch citizens, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturism said.
Local experts also link the explosions to the August 7 referendum, at which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft of a new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by the military junta.
The voters needed to determine whether they support a system in which the upper house of parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the country’s prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the army commander Prajuta Chan-ocha.
This move, he said, was driven by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, introduced the commanding hour and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
Bangkok is in a state of emergency.
The Government of Thailand led by Prime Minister Yingluck Chinavat in January 2014 declared the state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred in central Bangkok near the Victory monument, where one of the main protests took place, in which 28 people were injured, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown people on motorcycles.
Authorities have tightened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect protesters.
The development of conditions has begun in the Dry Lodge.
As it became known, the government was asked to agree on the draft conditions of the auction on the gold mining field of Sukhoi Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction proposes not to allow companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those contenders in whose capital will not be at least 25% of the state share.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking a complex and expensive project.
The auction may be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the government a draft order and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold mining field in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources told "Ъ", familiar with the situation.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
A spokesman for the vice-premier Alexander Khloponin, who oversees subsoil use, told "Ъ", that the project has not been submitted to the official's apparatus.
"Auction can be announced in August, immediately after the issue of the government order, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications of potential participants (at least 45 days) tender can take place in October," - say in the Ministry of Nature.
According to "Ъ", the project preserved two key requirements to potential participants, prescribed in the version, which was sent for agreement to the ministries and FOAs in July (there is "Ъ").
The first is the presence of at least 25% state share in the capital of the applicants.
The second is the denial of access to auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic companies.
According to the two articles specified in the draft Federal Law, as already wrote "Ъ" August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship can not be allowed to the auction.
The government has the right to introduce such restrictions, as the dry log belongs to the subsoil of federal value (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project “contained restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details before the government ordered.
The demand for state share in the capital of the participants of the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "Ъ" to the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by its predecessor Sergey Yeroshenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with "Rostek".
Who lobbied the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors "Ъ" do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give up control of the largest gold field in Russia against the backdrop of Western sanctions," says an interlocutor of "Ъ", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskoy said that foreigners "could go to the consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
Interlocutors say it is unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the dry log in the industry is considered the consortium of the largest gold producer of the Russian Federation PJSC "Polus", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rosteh".
As "Ъ" wrote, in July partners created SP "SL Gold", where "Polyus" has 51% of shares, in the structure of "Rostec" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, and the Polus said that they are "obviously interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," the Polus said.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is for the government of the Russian Federation, sources said.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, stated about the possibility of participation in the development of the Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "Ъ", are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold industrials of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated "Ъ" investment in Suhoy Log in $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are frightened not only by the volume of investments, but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and the technology of working with complex minerals are needed, explain the interlocutors "Ъ" in the industry.
On the pension market started the largest M&A deal - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of merging four controlled NPPs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfond Pension Acquisitions" will be created NPF with the amount of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
On the launch of the procedure for the unification of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension Acquisitions" - yesterday announced the owner of 100% of the funds LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
"Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank in compliance with the requirement not to deteriorate the conditions of the current contracts," the company said in a statement.
The association is conducted on the basis of the "Gazfond Pension Acquisitions".
As noted by the director-general of this NGF, Oleg Byaloshitsky, the consolidation of the funds allows to solve several tasks: expansion of the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reduction of costs, circulation of the best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate governance.
According to him, the indicative deadline for completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the consolidation of the NPP, Gazfond Pension Acquisitions will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the amount of pension savings of the joining funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPP "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group launched the unification itself much later than its competitors.
Thus, the O1 group-controlled NFP "Future" absorbed "Stall Fund" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NFP joins the funds "Uralsif" and "Russian Standard".
“The unification into a single structure, in addition to the reduction of costs, is necessary for the solution of structural tasks,” said Nikolai Sidorov, director-general of the NFP “Future”.
Active work on the consolidation of funds since April is also ongoing in the pension group "Safmar" - NFP "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund" should join the NFP "Safmar" by the end of the current year.
In 2017 they will be joined by the NFP "Trust".
“The combination of funds will give the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses,” Safar said in a statement.
The pause in the consolidation of funds, which was held by “KIT Finance Pension Administrator”, may be caused by several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, NFPs could not buy more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds that the group was actively placed in.
After amendments to the resolution of the Central Bank in March of this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire issue can be purchased by one large player", - indicates the director of the rating group of financial institutions AKRA Yuri Nogin.
Several NFP leaders from the top 15 on assets called another possible reason for the pause the division of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, personnel appointments in a single fund, which should have been agreed by the group owners.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
The request of "Ъ" in the NFP "Gazfond" was also not answered.
Although fund consolidation is a time-consuming and inexpensive event, in the long run this decision will be justified.
As noted by the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov, "Gazfond Pension Acquisitions" has fewer outflows, joining will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of KIT Finance and Promagrofonds will be required in the construction of OPS retail sales, as well as the use of more modern software.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NFP are constantly growing, so duplicating the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy is not feasible, says the managing director for corporate ratings "Expert RA" Pavel Mitrofanov.
"The effect of reducing duplicating functions will unambiguously cover the possible costs of unification," said Mitrofanov.
The cost of joining the four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates in 30-50 million rubles.
"The costs for the maintenance of four such funds amount to about 400 million rubles per year, with the consolidation in the medium-term perspective, the budget will actually be reduced by half," said Mr. Okolesnov.
The best Disney movie "Pit and his dragon" has been released in Russia.
Beautiful sights of New Zealand, a seductive dragon, a heartbreaking story and country-style songs are enough to re-believe in old-fashioned magic, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human child and a gentle babysitter, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of a puppy from a fairy tale book, plays with him in the catch and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he, grown up and in a lumpy bandage, can no longer be distinguished from another deliberate forest caterpillar - Maugli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by the red-haired woman-eager Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively spills the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help to save him.
Pete goes through an accelerated course of "being a man" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their hearts and smile more blindingly than in any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too terribly to be really hated or feared by the viewer.
Even Gavin, who opened a hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an irreparable villain.
The huge furry dragon also turned out to be not scary at all, with a good bulldog face, aircraft wing size and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon funnyly whispers, whispers, even whispers and, fortunately, does not speak, but it is always wanted to chew, this is advantageously different from all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small viewers, but also adults begin to cry desperately in the three streams.
Surprisingly good and minor is Oaks Figlie as Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously delivers a canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowery manage to make a fantasticly cute remake of the forgotten Disney film “Dragon Pitt” from 1977, intermediate from nose to tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and gaming movies, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
A miracle helped.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers and most of the strange jokes on board.
In this good fairy tale read traits borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other heart-loving children's paintings.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remixes of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as the same "Jungle Book", and there is no skilled villain in it as Kate Blanchett turned out to be in the role of the maid in the new "Pearl".
But this naive film is equally successful in helping to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys from the magical castle of Disney director Laurie will get again - for the artistic film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan".
Employed in the "Pete and his dragon" tandem David Laurie and screenwriter Toby Hallbrooks entered a new ambitious project about a young boy based on the fairy tale of the same name James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found shortcomings in the case of their defendant.
The fact that the prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from investigators yesterday.
We had planned to participate in the court session on the question of limiting the acquaintance with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the prosecutor’s office’s presentation,” said lawyer Olga Dinze.
She explained that the Prosecutor’s Office indicated the investigators on the non-conformity of the qualification of the case and the collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to remove gaps in the evidence base and file a new indictment against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June this year, it was that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the RBC journalist the formulation of "shaking the political situation toward instability" and "the overthrow of power illegally".
The correspondent of "Kommersantboscosport" ALEXANDR ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian national team, ate lunch in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
Life doesn’t seem to stop here for a moment.
Even at night.
The final starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, the settlement and expulsion from the village is carried out without stopping, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which we are located, consider it exemplary - it was put into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all checkers, even in it there are some shortcomings.
That with hot water problems, then, forgive me, with toilets.
We have been fighting for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleansers began to come, but only piss some substance on the floor, and all.
You see, they have some innovations.
They cannot be washed humanly.
Let us know these floors - the laminate is ordinary!
Generally speaking, the cleaning company has changed and now everything is OK.
The Olympic village is such Southern Butovo, a sleeping area, flanked on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive river, places poured with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence throughout the perimeter, along which automakers walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-story buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is fully dedicated to the needs of our national team.
Looking at the small hallway at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems are apparently the most pressing for the domestic team.
On the registration stand hang two ads: the printed "Please do not throw paper into the toilet!" and from the hand "I will accept a gift of icons.
The stall itself drowns in booklets.
Their fun colour contrasts with the titles of brochures: "Memory on infectious diseases for traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First Aid for drowning, entering a foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "First Aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures and bleeding".
The text inside is encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, a favorable outcome is not for everyone.
Of course, in the location of the national team of Russia there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
In front of the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "In spite of anything, we will win!"
And of course the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear will believe in them.
Let us be smaller, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even greater elevation of spirit, the announcement hangs: “Dear brothers and sisters!
On the blessing of the Most Holy Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by Proto-hierarch Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev.
Orders and other services can be made by phone.
In general, there is a Center of meditations and religious rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Because the elevator was busy from the ninth to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during a fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were the sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I think, in a willingness at any time to rush to the washing of innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold stairs.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time friend – Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batutists, who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his educator, European champion Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about at large, - the impressions of the well-deserved coach of Russia are shared. - We live for two, the beds, of course, almost stand, but it is uncritical.
Sanuzel is one on four, but it is spacious.
The closet, of course, funny, made of fabric, does not cause confidence, but things can be put.
“No, you’re pretending, they’ve finished their tea!” says the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, who was met by me in the main dining room.
The main is called at least because it represents an area of 2,7 thousand square meters. m and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
There are 60,000 servings per day completely free of charge.
The menu options are as follows: “Best of Brazil”, “Cools of the World”, “Asian dishes” and “Pizza, pastries”.
The last option, as I saw, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, say, soups I did not find in any of the units of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soup? – surprised Kuznetsova. – No tea!
I’m glad I got the Chinese with me.
and the tea.
But in general, to you understand, we have even worse food on the courts.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable uniformity.
Personally, I chose a peanut for a pair and fricadels in a tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plaque with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, to admit, it was eaten.
I don’t even understand why this line stands all the time at local McDonald’s.
Full, relaxed, you can say, "warm" athletes at the exit of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
A victory, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
They are provocative, I can say.
To get a gift, you need to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
I was attacked by a girl from WADA.
But it was not that I attacked.
I went into a patriotic drive, of course.
The second question was: “If I receive a notification about doping control, should I immediately go to the doping checkpoint?”
I stopped on option B: “No – I have an hour.”
I lost, so to speak, the vigilance.
I’ve forgotten that we don’t have to wait for WADA relief.
You need to appear immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the victory, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason I thought that if I find it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and for me, by the way, it’s hard!), then I could use bioadditives to get “additional nutrients to boost my productivity.”
No, they are not allowed!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that they do not categorically prohibit, but insist, in several sentences respond.
WADA is unfair!
What are you doing, Russia? asks the leader of the victory.
There is nowhere to retreat – behind Jefimov, Isinbayev and our whole bloodless team.
So I concentrated and won the unfortunate T-shirt with the last strength.
As they say, our own!
In a victorious mood, I went to the neighborhood fitness center.
Counting the coaches.
He fell to 250.
With surprise, he noted that no Russian athlete was found in this accumulation of running tracks.
But maybe it is right?
Training for those who can’t play!
In a nearby clinic, one of our friends was sitting.
In turn to the oculist.
Don’t worry, not a shooter.
In the clinic, however, as in the whole village, wherever you spit, hangs a device for the issuance of condoms.
On it is written an inspiring calling: “Celebrate with a condom!”
Further, it remains only to spin the iron, resembling a door lock pen, and a condom made of natural latex of the Amazon, willingly falls out of the device.
I took it for myself, for memory.
Athletes will not be missing - they brought them 450 thousand.
Just for the festive and festive time in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Next to it, for instance, there is a note that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table soccer and hockey, and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
I am interested in a comrade in the form of the Ukrainian national team, who is actively using a strange toy.
I could, of course, just say that he doesn’t want to talk to a man in the form of the Russian national team, and that’s all.
Here, by the way, by some strange conjunction of circumstances in the eyes of the boys in yellow-blue.
The most popular game, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking into each corner, it takes at least three hours.
But, if you go, rather than riding an electric car, you will open the house of the Canadian team with salmon at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bathroom, and a ticket office, and a washing room, and a cleaning room, and a hairdresser, and a flower store, and a store with everyday consumer goods, and a post office with unique brands (only you will still not be able to wait for the line from Chinese philanthropists), and a bank, and a bureau of finds, and a photo kiosk.
And late in the evening you, weakened, will sit near an olive tree hanged with colorful strips in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who left this world.
And you will be accompanied by a machine, disorderly spraying fluid to kill insects, thinking of the eternal.
of the Olympic Movement.
This village does not stop for a moment.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching the Australians barely punish the American Dream Team, the real fans went to the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in rap at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I’m even the only Moscovite who saw how it happened – not counting those, of course, who watched the Carioca competition that night.
This can only be understood by a true fan.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors from below – as always at night – wake up and start screaming innocently, but very loudly at each other.
It is dangerous to move furniture.
The crane is running in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the sanitary officer asked, a new one.
In the television schedule nothing is clear, so I just kept on the control of the channels "Match", "First" and in any case "Russia" - although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the homeland of repetitions, the whole sport there is for some reason in the record.
There the series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for the "Match" - the whole evening the young man screamed in news releases first about the great semi-final Deriglazov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of basketball – the United States – Australia.
I can say nothing bad about this decision.
The Australians were equal and won the first half.
They put in place of the offspring of their own greatness Americans.
As a result, they lost, but as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all fine, but the fight with Di Francesca is approaching, and on the screen without changes.
In a slight panic, I begin to lay out the channels.
This feeling, twice in a row.
Go deep into the cable.
None of the thematic "matches" are featured.
I feel like the fight is about to begin.
The texts and tweets of some sports websites do not please me.
Convulsive surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the site "First", it turns out, a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point of time.
I click on the fence, I get a battle for gold.
Deriglazova perfectly counterattacks, goes ahead on the points - and obviously begins to pull time.
The Italians are taking almost the entire stretch.
We are one point ahead, to the end a little more than two seconds.
Di Francesca throws on Deriglasova, then retreats, time ends, the Italian makes an injection.
The Victory !
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports about the fourth gold medal.
I was the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful and involved.
The Muslim Spiritual Administration of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM obliged its imams to hold Friday sermons only in Tatar, to force young Tatars to "learn their native language".
The administration said it “does not under any circumstances violate” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
According to the Tatar Mufti Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language".
"For those who will say that it is "heavy", in every large mosque we intend to organize classes of the Tatar language absolutely free of charge," Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques the sermons "should already be in the Tatar language".
He reminded that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak Tatar enough well, "can be thoroughly prepared for them."
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the Mufti, in the areas Friday sermons are held exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time in Kazan in a number of mosques previously used predominantly Russian language.
In particular, as the Mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and "Enyler".
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed, the management sets the task that all students speak both the state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any violation of the Muslims-netar," Mohametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not the mandatory, the main part of prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will still be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will be kept in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mohammetshin said that there was no serious threat of the expulsion of the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WTC).
Rinat Zakirov, the head of the GCC executive committee, said: “The mosques are an important part of our national life.”
It would be sad if the Tatar language had gone out of this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of sermons only in the Tatar language "is the wish of the imams themselves", but in the executive committee of the CCC "consider this correct".
The interviewed "Ъ" imams, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties with understanding the clergy.
There are Russians and Tatars in the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course they will be upset.
"We will have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, sermons in Russian are closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian and in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere from the beginning."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We trust in Allah.
Allah will show the way out of this situation,” he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
They are Uzbek, Tajik and Azerbaijani.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we’ve been translating into Russian for four years,” said Imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermons will "reach to a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience".
We will comply with the decision of the plenary.
The end of the sermon will be different.
But time will show.
"For me, for example, it will only be easier, because the Tatar language is my native language," Galliullin concluded.
Former FSC director sentenced to court
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow has approved the indictment in the investigated criminal case of the GSU SCR about the theft of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Russian Federation.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused the FSIN damages in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles, will be tried.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office has sent a criminal case to the Zamoskvoretsky district court against the former director of the Federal Penal Service of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Kryvolapov, as well as the director of the Federal Penal Service “Center for Information and Technical Supply and Communication of the Federal Service for Punishment Execution” (FGUP CITOS) Viktor Definelyev.

In 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated to the FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal the budget money, the members of the group developed a scheme according to which the under-controlled enterprise FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices overpriced several times.
Despite the fact that FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, structures for the placement of production capacities, allowing to create a completed cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between him and the Russian Federation of Financial Services five state contracts for the amount of more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found on the accounts of the Samara branch of FGUP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case in respect of which is allocated to separate proceedings.

In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN to the accused claimed compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.

Igor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which were 2-3 times less expensive than for foreign films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood tracks.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which on average 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
“And even for them it is very difficult to compete with the Transformers and Iron Man, for whose promotion huge budgets are spent,” he said.

In Mias (Chelyabinsk region) the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakov Konstantin Akulić was detained.
According to another lawyer of the accused, Sergey Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulić was summoned to the investigative department of the SCR Miasa today to file an indictment in the case of a year ago about the infliction of beating.
Then Konstantin Akulić went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"Initially it was initiated against unidentified persons.Now when he started defending Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was a Shark," - believes Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulić became the lawyer of the former deputy governor in early August.

The Russian copper company is ready to take social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has taken up the modernization of one of the oldest and ecologically "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh Medeplavil Combinate.
Karabakh Medeglaval Plant was founded by an English joint-stock company headed by Leslie Urkward in 1910.
In Soviet times it was a significant industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually provided the life of a whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which caused serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998 it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh Medeplavil Combinate.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already sadly known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedy began to change in 2004, after the company went under the management of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was noted recently by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first months of July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the great changes that have occurred with the enterprise since "Karabashmed" moved into the group of RMK.
The main modernization event of Karabashmedy in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, allowing to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of JSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the converter redistribution.
The replacement of the three converters, pollinators and gas pipeline is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016 it is planned to launch a new industrial sewage treatment workshop worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes charged to the budget of the city of Karabakh will also increase.
For the entire duration of the implementation of the Tomin GOC project - from the beginning of construction and until the commissioning of the second turn - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the introduction of GOC in operation, the income of taxes to budgets of all levels can amount to 80,9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna district, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to budgets of different levels.
This is for the first year.
"The longer the company works successfully, the greater the amount of deductions can be," Valery Ulanovsky added.
In 2015 tax deductions from the Mikheevsky GOC approached 1 billion rubles.
However, participation of enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
The enterprises of RMK help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, improve the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was a major repair, and in fact - almost complete restructuring of N9 kindergarten for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
There will also be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and overground parking spaces for 600 car seats, cafes and sports stores.
"RMC Arena" will allow to conduct spectacular professional sports events of the international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to residents of Chelyabinsk, primarily for children.

WSJ: The United States is considering the issue of imposing sanctions against Russia due to the hacking of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering the issue of introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama will have to officially accuse Russia or Russian-backed hackers of attacking servers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are practically confident that Russia is involved in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who are carrying out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hack of the database of Sony Entertainment Pictures, the responsibility for which was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The process of decision-making on sanctions can be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to aggravate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was that the administration of Barack Obama permits the possibility of the application of sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published electronic correspondence of the Democratic National Committee.
The media that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the hack.
The Kremlin called such statements absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
This is due to the distortion of competition in the mobile app market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
FAS found support for these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install other apps along with the Google Play store.
According to the results of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service has decided to punish Google, said Deputy head of the FAS Alexei Dotenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days after the entry into force of the decision.
The FAS concluded that the law on protection of competition must be complied with by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then determine with further actions: execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as violating the competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a peace agreement.
This measure will lead to nothing.
This opinion was expressed by the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect neither users nor the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat’s “Animate” Effect Criticized as Caricature on Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by an anime, but some reviewers say it is racially unstable.
With the help of the “Lens” tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog or a character like the painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, curved tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Mistakes are quickly becoming known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused that the app advertised dark face skin or encouraged whitened faces as a beauty ideal.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them crooked eyes, curved teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics considered it a racist cartoon of the “yellow people” of Asia.
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions point to a more serious diversity problem for the company.
News and outrage spread on The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was conceived as a tribute to the characters of the anime, not as a cartoon on the Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with Anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose photos were actively tweeted, said the lens was “insulting and at least awkward.”
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison side by side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but in the most degrading degree yellowish.
Snapchat is not the only company that goes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat—who are more racially diverse than their older generation—may mean they’re more likely to expect understanding.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katy Zhou, "this course of events is much harder to stay unnoticed than it was before."
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity in snapchat recruitment.
Zhou criticized the company’s predominantly white leadership, consisting only of men, and ended her article with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu wrote, who herself is an American of Chinese descent: "Either they didn't have enough blacks in the state to make such decisions, or they work blacks but they don't hold such positions that they can speak safely and openly."
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing discontent that Snapchat has not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter with the aim of focusing on underrepresented segments of the population and on active attempts to engage internal resources.
She said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I’m wondering if they really need more users like us so they can say that’s not going.”
Military leadership distorted intelligence on ISIS, reports congressional commission
Officials from the U.S. Armed Forces Central Command modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground suggest, a congressional commission said in a report released on Thursday.
The interim report of an operational group set up by the Republican chairs of the House of Representatives Committee on Armed Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Assignment Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that the leaders had misrepresented their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the Century, is the main military command in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by the highest command of the Central Committee, as a rule, gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than is confirmed by real data from the site of events, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services," the report said.
“What was happening at the Central Committee is unacceptable: when the top leadership finds an unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican from California, a member of the House of Representatives.
Problems with leadership in the Central Committee reach the very top of the organization.
The report, which consists of 10 pages, details the shortcomings that arose repeatedly in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of U.S. actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration’s leadership had ordered the reports to be falsified, it argues that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership is forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, this is known for sure,” House member Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leadership of the U.S. Central Command forged intelligence documents to undermine the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that analysts expressed concern that intelligence data about the Islamic State was being counterfeited.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
Additional, yet unfinished investigation of the intelligence data of the Central Committee is conducted by the chief inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. House Intelligence Committee published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican operational group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centom created an excessively closed procedure to produce intelligence assessments concerning ISIS and the Iraqi guard forces," said House member Adam B. Shiff, Democratic Party chief representative in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, "hindered the release of intelligence documents", damaged the moral state of analysts and "insufficiently reflects divergent views."
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to force Centcom analysts to tailor their conclusions to “a given or political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by the portal The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times on the existence of an investigation by the chief inspector of the Pentagon, opened following complaints from analysts at Centcom.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not comment on the congressional report as long as the chief inspector’s investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes differ in opinions when it comes to interpreting complex data, and the intelligence services and the Defense Ministry welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues related to national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria is achieving its goal (as is now claimed by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year’s statements raise doubts about whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide truthful estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the intelligence about the Islamic State repeats the controversy of more than a decade ago, when the CIA intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest triggered by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements of the opposite, airstrikes on Islamic State-owned oil tanks did not significantly deteriorate the terrorist group’s financial situation because it built temporary oil tanks to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not spread outside the Central Command, the Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many MPs viewed as an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins four consecutive times in women's grass hockey, thus approaching the decisive battle with Britain
Once scoring three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team when the Americans defeated the Indian team with a 3-0 score.
Five goals in two games are supposed to be a memorable achievement, but the 27-year-old says she’s not sure if she’d ever done something like that.
“I will not put my mind,” she said.
I’m really not one of those people who keep track of their goals.
Here’s what she knows: the Americans count 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeaten after losing Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams compete for the quarter-finals, and the outcome of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who - second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, a little weathering when the quarter-finals games begin.
However, Saturday’s game shows that the Americans made a noise here with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bob was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a grass hockey clutch when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not pass the qualifying tournament to the final.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong with her and her teammates.
The following year, Coeig Parnemont, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, a change in physical fitness,” she said.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity we have now.
We completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bum opened the account in the first half of the game by throwing from an uncomfortable hand on a short distance.
India approached the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bum took the initiative into his hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then the spiral went in the middle and sharply sent the ball to the goal, thereby giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is in blow.
Just like Bam.
“We are in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the Olympic Games - "zen" jumping on a trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is now, this is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and inevitable, it is a vicious combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic fire itself is that burning torch that is transmitted from the racer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in turn in a cafe without hearing about Simon Bailes, Katie Ledeckie, or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there is Logan Dolly.
Dolly, the first to participate in the Olympic Games, a beautiful man with holes on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities shown in primary times promoted by sponsors and life-affirming advertisements, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a feather.
But 28-year-old Dolly from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic competitions in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all events equally.
Further from the center, partially in the shadow, are those sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic pistol shooting, bow shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal bias, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the tramp.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I surveyed were unaware that they relate to the Olympic sports at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not enter the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men’s awards, while Chinese and Canadians share women’s awards.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumping on trampoline has the charm of an outsider, in particular because for the unlearned ear they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but just an enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential – a caricature flash of endless jumps – but also the elegance of gymnastics and water jumps, two sports they mostly combine.
The word “batut” comes from the Spanish word “el trampolín”, meaning “trampoline for jumping into the water.”
The winning contenders jump on a giant trampoline, taking off almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and saltos) before the final landing on their feet.
They are rated by performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most popular Olympic course is forward.
Medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, there and there on the field.
They tend not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the sight of the television cameras, to another annoying boundary: a world record or an Olympic record.
This stubborn striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical — and it is enough to make even the viewer blink.
But I think it’s a bit tired to watch the games.
From him, jumping on the tramp gives a breath.
The direction of the bathtub is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps up, seems unheavy like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they, of course, do not go without competition or difficulties, but during the whole program there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no leaps in length, only a wonderful, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the Olympic sport closest to Zen.
The women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at the hour of day in Eastern European time; men - on Saturday, also at the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daily program starting at 14:00 on both days.
At the height of the Olympic madness, a quiet, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in the common landfill.
And if awareness growth can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to coveted views and objectivization—as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States—Dully is just waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
“Generation Protests” in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were deadly wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights activists said the government’s reaction was brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Video footage from the protest sites, allegedly filmed late last year or earlier this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
A senior UN human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from collapsing, and it will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in the international crisis research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability isined by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to tackle terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations are constantly referring to government repressions — the opposition on the territory of the state was crushed by the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were deported, imprisoned, murdered or expelled to remote deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and they are left with no other option than to protest, there will be a uprising,” said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely supplanted the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit the unrest and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, are bursting out now.
The first, seemingly completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian high mountainous areas of Ethiopia have thrived in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"We will act jointly under a common principle," said Mulatou Gemec, leader of Oromo.
The biggest protests took place in the districts of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and which controls the military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenoui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopian prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was skillful in recognizing the first signs of discontent and used spies to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, an analyst of conflict situations.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalin, appeared from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southern man.
Analysts say it is not trusted by the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people marched out against what analysts said appeared to have been elections that the government blocked and then falsified the results.
During the subsequent repression, many Protestants were killed, though in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts thanked Ethiopian leaders for their forward-looking infrastructure development, such as a new inter-city train, and significant progress in fighting poverty.
But obviously, this has not stopped the rise of internal dissatisfaction with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked owned by Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming widespread.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
“And this stretched rope will be hard to get through,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to shut down the latest conflict covering his election headquarters on Friday by claiming that he was joking when he stated several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of a Republican presidential candidate to speak intelligently to the American people.
It also put his supporters, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an uncomfortable position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Having made this assumption at the congress on Wednesday evening, Trump firmly insisted on his claim on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just riding.
This post was the direct opposite of the claim made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the speech by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy against the backdrop of lowering the rating.
Trump and Clinton delivered competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to return to the topic.
Again, using Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to tax increases, and said he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
In late July, after he attracted general criticism by virtually expressing the idea that Russians should hack Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks by saying, “Of course, I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some messages that get feedback among his fans, watching how they act, and then "explaining" them in one direction or another, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who conducted the language analysis of both candidates.
But I also think he’s cautious in his statements and knows they’re vague enough to interpret them differently.
Rather than softening statements to the wider electorate, Trump has taken an even more blatant tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking published on Friday showed that Trump is behind Clinton with a big advantage in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and goes with her to the level in Florida.
While Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the subject of increased attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in a discomfortable position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most famous deputy officers, made serious efforts to defend the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he says is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that, before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it all happened because it pulled its troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans assure that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to settle the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for dismissing every word and prejudice toward him.
He mocked the “poor unfortunate” television experts trying to solve it, and said, “They are weak!”
Some Democrats have mocked Trump’s excuses as unnecessary proof that he is not suitable for presidents.
Once removed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a barren, cash-only seat in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was displaced from her window room on Bedford Avenue.
Shop "Soup Sherry", which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of biscuits.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in the renewed city.
Artist Molly Krabbel tweeted: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is destroyed, and Verbe is now a soap store.”
But while New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is being updated.
The revived Verbe coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verba has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started working for Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to promote it in a new location, he said he would be happy to go for it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left much in its former form.
Verb works with the same beagle distributor and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even installed lanterns from the old "Verba".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new meals.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are topings from cappers or fried onions.
There are dishes of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now fresh juices are prepared.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed the steady flow of old regular customers.
“Many former customers were also outraged with prices from Williamsberg,” he said.
One recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who is 34 years old, previously lived in Williamsberg and frequently visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After closing Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verba,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered cupcaked tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been dedicated to the Verbe since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
“At fifty-eight o’clock, every day, like the clock, I came, and they prepared my beagle with oil and all the fillings for me,” he said.
Rodriguez told me that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he changes something with the help of bacon, egg or cheese on the bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he was not offended by the fact that the soap store once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of "Soup Cherry" offered to make a special soap for "Verba", using coffee from the coffee shop, cooked in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we may agree to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also liked this coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the showroom so that his new neighbors would feel welcomed.
The new place has other benefits.
A local juice selling point plans to pour into bottles and sell cold-cooked coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the cafe opened in a new location, Whitt said that by entering and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt like he was back home.
“How long have I wanted to smell that smell,” he confessed.
Depressive Food Depression in the "Tight Table"
In March 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Cabinet.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as Fua Gra and Maryland Turtle Soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: ferched eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée, and dessert pudding made of shrimp.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Cove added, “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in food history.
Coo's latest book, "Ragu in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a rental apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 on Fruit Garden Street".
Their new joint work, “The Tough Meal,” which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
Demonstrating to some extent their own culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny snack bar in the Flatiron Quarter that has been operating since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange Crash.
Ziegelmann, 54, ordered butter and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, potato purple and a vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple thought it was a good starting point for a discussion about food during the Depression era.
“Roulette was in great demand,” Siegelman said.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe was upset.
“He probably was lying in his stomach with a stone,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women were cooking for the male farm workers, and a fresh baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who shipped food to starving Europeans during World War I. The “Tough Meal” describes how the country managed to cope with the fact that it suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulette and bakeries, became the main foods; baking was a “great way to recycle snacks,” Siegelman noted, “because chefs could hide unappetitive ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, for many years the foundation of American food, has become economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions chewed with peanut oil.
"This addition to the dining table has not been successful," Cove said.
Ziegelmann added, “It was very strange.”
Peanut oil is not suitable for baked onions.
This was typical for many home recipes.
More than ever before and since then, household experts — including Louise Stanley, head of the federal household bureau from 1923 to 1943 — have controlled the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers", take the challenge and turn a burda like scrubbed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Tight Dinner" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy are the stories of the government’s reaction to starving citizens, such as the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of “let them eat cakes.”
Having publicly preached the simple Iowa farmers of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
“He liked the continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumbers sauce,” Coe said.
He ate almost in the golden dining room, wearing a smoking.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to take the example with his own stomach.
As the book tells, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who wasn’t interested in taste at all, and this led to the White House “consuming not only the most disgusting food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked.”
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelmann says, and how science has been used in cooking.
The spouses say that during the writing of the book, they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelmann’s mother – that she couldn’t throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of carelessness about food,” Coe said.
Ziegelmann recalls: “She seriously poisoned people.”
There was one unpleasant incident with profiles.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, they got the dessert they had prepared at home from Cove: the snack dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“That’s called moss from shrimp,” Siegelman said, adding that it was a common technique – to give humble recipes shitty names.
There were no shredded cream, only sly, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed a spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for supplements twice.
In the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife: "A little rubbed walnuts would not bother here."
The arrest of the persons in the case of the mass fight at the Hovan Cemetery extended until November 14
Presnensky court left until November 14 under arrest of the persons involved in the case of the mass struggle at the Hovansk Cemetery, satisfying the corresponding petition of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
On May 14, a massive fight of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons occurred at the Hovan Cemetery, resulting in the death of three people.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabujev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov have been charged with the organization of murder.
The question of the second for 2016 indexation of pensions may be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets on August 12 during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters on how much you need to raise the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now the economists are summarizing the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two or three weeks,” Golodets said.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age by six months each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that this topic is not being considered in the cabinet.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on the position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in small-caliber rifle shooting.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in shooting from a low-caliber rifle from the position of lying at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifications.
Kirill Grigoryan was second with 628.9 was.
Eight of the best athletes went to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt," Gulen told Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if at least some part of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
A court in Istanbul has previously detained the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
A military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead Companies Will Repay Lawyers' Costs During Hepatitis C Patent Dispute With Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to be reimbursed for the costs of lawyer services it incurred in connection with a patent lawsuit on a drug for hepatitis C with drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempt from paying $200 million in damages for breaches of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s drugs, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a series of violations by Merck, including swearing lies and other unethical actions.
In his appeal to the court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Beth Lebson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred during the contestation.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck filed lawsuits against each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
U.S.-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed armed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the remaining group of militants who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharphan Darvis of the allied military council of Manbij told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking cleaning operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal tax
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable donations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speeches, and the former secretary of state claimed $3 million in revenue from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her stay in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, released the tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard of financial transparency,” Clinton’s election staff adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and breaking his past promises to disclose his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers have called the State Tax Service check as the reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton’s pre-election staff adviser, Jan Sams, tweeted, referring to the declarations of the Democratic party candidate.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks were completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his rejection raised questions about his status, charity contributions, business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the issue and on Friday released an online video featuring prominent Republicans who persuaded Trump to disclose tax returns.
She raised the issue during her speech on the economy in Michigan on Thursday.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate without exception has done for decades: to disclose his tax returns,” she said.
Politico that Trump hadn’t paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business review on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as believing that it’s still the case.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, offered Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also checked by the IRS, and that Trump was “fearing” not the tax agency, but the voters.
Clinton’s pre-election staff released tax returns until 2007.
The Clinton, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 statement showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index equity fund, and Clinton dividends and $109,000 in capital income.

Chili powdered condoms and fireworks increase protection for Tanzanian elephants
Environmental fighters in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from entering settlements by throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Committee on Nature Conservation, took on its promotion by teaching volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many people used spies to protect themselves.
Today is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented a set of tools ... we’ve seen a change in attitude within these communities, resulting in them being much more confident that they can’t let elephants into their fields without harming elephants,” Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps consist of lighting the torch in front of the elephant that breached the border and providing signals with a horn.
If it is not possible to scare it off, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with a cloth in a condom, and its end is twisted, only the fittle remains outside.
When ignited, the condom breaks with a thunderstorm, spraying the fine dust of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to move an elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launch device that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey since the coup attempt in July.
This was stated by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 personnel diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of them, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
In July, a coup attempt took place in Turkey.
The country's authorities officially stated that the coup had failed, and also the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military ranks of the highest and middle rank.
As a result of the attempted coup, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, 290 people died.
A Jewish director sharply criticized a Berlin hotel for removing the Israeli phone code at the "request" of the Arabs, RT News.
The French filmmaker of Jewish origin sparked a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli phone code on the list, with officials referring to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to recruit Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the hotel administration stand.
The response he received there, according to Lanzman, “shocked him.”
The hotel's Clerk said the measure was "a thoughtful decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain."
The reason behind this move provoked the director’s even greater anger.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code for Israel be removed,” said Lanzman, a hotel servant.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsmann called the incident "a terrible shame," the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
In fact, it is a terrible shame.
That this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain is even more shameful.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case caused considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski Hotel has simply "goed to the cause" of the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“We would be ashamed,” another post said, stating that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel has rushed to reject any accusations, calling the incident a "disregard" and "apologies" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the list of fast-gathering," the Kempinski hotel's spokesman told the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police tried to disperse students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
According to the proposals of Governor Geraldo Alckmin, 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls aimed at temporarily serving President Michael Temer.
This latest protest took place just days after protesters massively took to the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff, when the country’s Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71%, reports RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
"Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," he said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year Russia will be visited by a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can confidently say that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to twist the hooks in the defense-industrial complex.
The reasons for the dismissal were “systematic non-fulfillment” of the instructions of the CEO of Almaz-Antey, “misses in work” and “loss of confidence”.
Gennady Bendersky is appointed as head of the NGO for the next three years.
The information about the dismissal of Nekrodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause widespread resonance in the media.
How can such silence be explained in the context of a large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the defence-industrial complex (DPC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Nexodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of bringing order in the industry.
NGO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the group, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (ZRKs) of marine and land-based.
"Almaz" is currently working on the creation of Polyment-Redut and Morpheus missile systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Nekrodov is caused by the breakdown of deadlines on these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the commissioning was planned in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the latest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, in several years of testing, no truly successful trial has been carried out.
True, as far as I can judge, this is not the unambiguous fault of "Almaz", - said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay with the entry into operation can occur with the S-500 missile system.
Experimental development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should be sent to the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is planned and everything will be completed within the established deadlines", although in 2014 the ministry recognized the presence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the professional qualities of Nekrodov, who has been in charge of "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev noted that the deadlines for projects could be both a cause and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to extract information about internal processes in the OPC and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders worth tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, loves silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave their positions at their own will, under the agreement of the parties or transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the leader of the "Almaz" was possibly a figure of a stomp and resisted the "disorder" descending from above.
It seems that such behavior the state no longer intends to tolerate.
With the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to dispute with the Defense Ministry installations and do not perform the tasks set.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the provoking managers (machinations at the shipyard "Star").
The President personally pays more attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and regularly holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of OPC managers, striving to have a loyal staff of directors at hand, who will execute orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the backdrop of the rise of corruption and the absence of normal competition in the OPC, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation is stimulating the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the OPC, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of the post of Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has taken on the famous proverb, “If you want peace, prepare for war.”
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow's spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Evidence of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”,, there is no quiet corner left.
Despite the common trouble, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the navy and army.
Strengthening military power will enable Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to reach new frontier in world politics.
Scottish Kallum Skinner runs on the finish line, resulting in the British capturing the bike gold
Scottish calum skinner ran to the triumph in the men’s team sprint at a bike stadium in Rio last night, resulting in the British team trio defending its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old, native of Glasgow, was in the role of the strongest, which his Scottish friend Sir Chris Howe made his own, and the young man proudly entered history by sliding through the finish line to tear out the victory of the New Zealand favorite team.
Britain claimed the rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the rights to a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championship in London, despite the fact that Howe has since ended his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the specialist participant Jamie Staff.
They did just the same when Hindus appeared.
Hoye’s departure also created a void that Keane Emadi and Matt Cremton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches adhered to, seeing the potential in the Scottish who was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny – champions with Hoi four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic qualifying record, but the norm was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
The British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindus was right behind after his round, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindus drove on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi watched from his seat as a BBC guest expert and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindus as they entered the piedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “It’s a complacent comparison.”
I am here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012 along with Kenny and Hoi, Hindus admitted deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindus said, “I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the tribune.”
We’ve all met as a team in the last three months.
We’ve lost so many races with the world’s reputation that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then the bike bike is waiting for another five successful days.
With the shape demonstrated by Kenny, it’s not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeats the feat of Hoya, winning three Olympic gold medals in just one Games.
This would allow you to see how Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — brings his count to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be like Hoya.
The next time Kenny will compete in the sprint, which begins today and runs for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come here to win with your friends.
It’s a bit lonely to win alone, to be honest.
The Hindus said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should get the knighthood.”
This was the only medallion-game of the day, but there were subsequent good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified for the fastest four-mile team race of pursuit by four.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world record set when winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be at the center of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the corresponding women’s event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milwaukee improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13.260.
Team Britain has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the mid-range period of the Olympics and earn a bunch of medals.
After actually exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas on the backdrop, not least the departure of Chief Technical Officer Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening at the bike stadium, it seems that the legendary now glory of Britain in reaching the peaks at the right time may just be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminum factory in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is under threat because the power company that supplies the factory, according to one of the factory owners, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This move is a consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria government not to extend the subsidies granted to support the plant’s operation.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be threatened at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs – directly or indirectly – could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There could also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metal factory in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in Anglesey last year.
Alcoa’s Portland metal factory is losing money and risks closing.
These actions were the result of reflection on the future of the plant, which has been ongoing for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract as well.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the short-term joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the aforementioned contracts are so-called hedged contracts, which should have entered into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“As a result, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in the 2017 fiscal year,” the company said.
Whatever potential impact on AGL’s earnings starting from the 2018 fiscal year is currently limited to forecasts of a strong market for wholesale electricity futures.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in view of the “coming termination.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to run a metallurgical plant or provide electricity to the metallurgical plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was scheduled to enter into force in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared a possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Steven Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant decline in demand in the market [electricity].
For us as a producer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only reality show star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan of mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and defiled at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the “Kardashian Family?”), prepared reality video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (the debuters Rob and Caitlin, also joined them the most popular uncle of the show business, producer of the “Kardashian Family” Ryan Sickrest), forgot about the appearance of the sister on the cover, and in the end - the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
This is the standard plot line of almost all children’s birth anniversary TV shows (Sicreast pronounces the phrase, “Did you think we forgot about you?” with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the show at 8 am), but Chris needed that fame to get to other girls one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we are undoubtedly entering a new era of the Kardashian show.
Even though Kendall Kim’s older sister had been on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s most-selling issue of the year.
Thickness more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to calculations of the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
The news of who of the stars will be on the cover is expected with such anxiety that in the last two years the photos of the magazine have merged until the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured more “celebrities who work as models” than “models who are celebrities.”
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after the honor fell to Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, described by the magazine as the "outstanding model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she is in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality show stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful in her career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Jenner’s position in the fashion world, due to her past reality television star, has always been shaky.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the tricks of the moment."
These moods went up again after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to cling to dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She defiles for Mark Jacob.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own-handed photographs of Cindy Crawford’s daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she takes part in a reality show on television.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 disadvantaged people are denied services in public law centers as the sector prepares for an effect that will further cut funding for activities that are already at the limit.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to cope with unjust deprivation of property, and so on — have already been dismissed trying to get free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services already working beyond their capabilities are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers should lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Public Legal Centres, said that according to the National Association of Public Legal Centres’ latest census report, thousands of people are being dismissed every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not revoked, the situation will only worsen.
“Queensland’s public legal centers are constantly underfunded: this means thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorces, unfairly dismissed workers – all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less-protected residents of Queensland will be forced to solve complex legal issues without assistance.
We urge Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal assistance to the country average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palashchuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's election headquarters was sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s pre-election headquarters has been sued: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after reports that his operations director in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday at a state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state’s election headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that "this won't happen."
"Director Earl Phillip pulled out the pistol, put his right index finger on the shovel and directed the duo to Vincent's knee cup," Bordini said in a complaint.
Having complained to the local and regional administration of the election staff, Bordini realized that at least four other people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip.
“Pistols don’t have to be fired in order to cause damage,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a furor by telling audiences in North Carolina that “the people of the Second Amendment” — understood as weapons owners and amateurs — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
Trump’s pre-election staff said the media had pulled his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the election staff for negligent control, and from Phillip - for threatening physical violence, insulting by action and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is delaying in responding to a request to comment.
My attempts to talk to Philip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, that Phillip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Department of the Supreme Court of the District of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
In my opinion, this was precisely the enormous advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again, creating opportunities for locals and near Heathrow.
For our local settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most, not just a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and within the budget, from the T5 — selected as the airport’s best terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2, built in the middle of the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by £16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I’m confident that Heathrow’s expansion will be the same.
It is time for us to move the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Trade Attache of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play "cat-mouse" on the issue of blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ad-blocking software are a "cat-mouse" game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users can update their filters in the program to block social media ads again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site is changing the bar around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims it has been able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open-source ad blocking community and those trying to bypass it has been ongoing since the invention of ad blocking," and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the struggle is a clear sign of how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around the world, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is hunting for desktop ad blockers as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for social networks and Instagram, the spokesman said.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a sufficiently profitable article for Facebook to consider such a move a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “advertising preferences” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
Facebook said Thursday that the new Adblock filters are concerned as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This won't be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an official email.
Ad-blockers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to pass control into people’s hands.
A woman moved on a Swiss highway in an episode of obvious suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after the woman was moved by several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morz in the Canton of Vo just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but the identities of some have not yet been established, police said, urging them and anyone else who was a witness to the accident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the attack?
This is what the prosecutor must determine,” Hoffstetter said.
Two other similar incidents over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a man walking in the dark on the highway — a verdict was issued that motorists could not expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted for causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pierne on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, he heard the court.
The court found that the female police officer — who responded to the emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a way that was justified, and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morz should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Nassau have developed a model for studying the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was developed to determine whether Venus, with its hot waterless surface and carbon dioxide-saturated atmosphere, could ever have Earth-like conditions.
Scientists previously suggested that the small speed of rotation of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a diluted atmosphere, similar to Earth’s, and still rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus shifts its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as a umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from a substantial portion of solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly several degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously suggested by planetary researchers.
Despite the fact that Venus may once have been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned out by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew away, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained — that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey activity on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Colorado executive vice president/chief manager Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“Over the past three years, I have served my duties as chief coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities should perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the team’s work.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league’s best coach during his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a rating of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second preferential trip to the Western Conference.
A goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy has won four Stanley Cup – two with Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers’ strikes over the salaries of oil workers in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the discussion are starting a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
The strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes,” the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to look at the issues with a fresh look.
The unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contractors working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The reduction in rates from the company came after a 10 percent reduction in rates for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the decline in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to halt oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling crude oil prices: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts that has emerged in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in expenses for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measured the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleasant cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most comprehensive catalogue of the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleasant cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how periods of rotation correlate with planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our findings with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleasant cluster is 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just reaching maturity; they were born approximately 125 million years ago.
They are rotating as fast as they will never be again.
At their peak speed, these growing stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds have a deterrent effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as solar spots.
The latest catalogue of rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars are rotating slower than less massive stars.
Rival compares the stars to the dancers: the larger make the piruets slower than the smaller.
“In the Pleasant ballet, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars,” said Rivall.
Because the Pleasant cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of rotation.
“The Plejadic star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older,” said Rivall.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where, and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and hang their “dance shoes” on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades’ rotation speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation, related to the activity of a group of detained in the Crimea Ukrainian saboteurs, is conducted by two departments, writes "Kommersant".
The FSB is collecting evidence of involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotages in Crimea.
As previously, confessional testimony was given by the resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armenia, the oil base in Theodosius, the Kerch ferry crossing, a gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that it was not possible to detain all the divers.
This, in particular, was the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kyiv district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian national football team was Stanislav Cherchesov.
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union was made a decision on the appointment to the position of the chief coach of the Russian national team of football Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the completion of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive committee of the Russian Federation appointed the head coach of the Russian national team of football Stanislav Cherchesov.
He is a well-known footballer who previously played in the Moscow Spartak as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same Spartak, Pearl Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and the Warsaw Legion, which became the winner of the national championship and the country cup.
It is that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and is scheduled for two years.
Thus, it is he who has the duty to prepare the team for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that his coach staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that according to the salary of the entire coach staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set before Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of bringing the national team of Russia to the semi-finals and to win medals.
As the coach himself said, as a priority he considers creating a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is pleased that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov Russian national team will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall, previously, the post of chief coach of the Russian football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, which combined him with training in the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the national team of Russia at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad result of the team on himself.
Clamped between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since independence from South Africa in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million has achieved tremendous successes, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia’s success is that the government pays a lot of attention to education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce a tuition fee to “reimburse costs.”
However, in Namibia, primary school education is free.
Secondary education has been free since 2015.
The authorities of the country are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97% over the past ten years.
Despite the international trend of increasing inequality, in Namibia it is decreasing.
Compared to 1993, the Gini Coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate dropped from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also decreased, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country significantly outperformed the United States and other wealthy nations.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating – one of the highest in Africa – in the “Corruption Perception Index”, which is made up by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the ratio of debt to GDP is around 25%, which is less than one-third of the level of debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional measurement methods, remains quite high – 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high HIV/AIDS incidence rate – almost 17% of the population is infected.
According to World Bank estimates, Namibia is among the countries with an above-average income, but authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia faces some difficulties that are inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia has not thought to drop hands, the country solves the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical institutions in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians understood that neighbors are not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share deficient water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investments and student exchange.
Furthermore, the government of Namibia has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
Authorities understand that income from Namibia’s natural wealth needs to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from selling the country’s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that’s the case.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong government support for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state, Hague Geingob, noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia’s key resources are exhausted.
Some – such as fishing – are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonial order, inequality and low level of development - can get on the path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Per this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts was found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only from one burial, known as the "grave number 43", 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were extracted.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold could soon move to the unseen in appearance bushin found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tel Yunatite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tel Yunnanite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunnanite in the Pazardzhik district.
The busina is a gold strip wrapped into a ring.
Yavor Boyazhiyev, the head of excavations at Tel Yunatite, dated the discovery to 4600 BC and said it was at least 200 years older than Varna’s gold.
The treasures of Varna, let us recall, date from about the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
There is currently no technology to date a metal with perfect accuracy.
How do you know which gold is the oldest?
Obviously, Professor Boyazhiyev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that Yunasite's gold is older than Varna's gold."
This finding is of utmost importance: it’s a tiny object in sight, but it’s big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-and more carefully study the archaeological layer where the gold artefact was found.
This will help to date the bush with the most accuracy possible.
The location also explains a lot.
Tel Yunatite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Nowadays, Tel Yunnanite is considered the oldest “city” in Europe.
Tel was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, the processing of metals rapidly developed in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In domestic historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: the Balcano-Carpate metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to emerge around the centers of metalworking.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunasite is probably the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tel Yunasite the prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“It’s a place 1,000 years older than Sumer,” says Bojajiev, referring to the popular belief that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
There were the first towns in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Telja Junacite have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of a fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
Little has survived from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban density, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tel Yunasite is often referred to as the "bird city": dozens of clay bird figures have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local worship.
The "bird town" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-meter walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of the elderly, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by combat tails.
New finds and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Varna gold", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that Varna’s golden luxury should have preceded something – something like a tiny golden bucket created in the Tella Junacite.
In Porsche artificially aged model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being prepared manually by the specialists of the unit, who work with the production machines.
The retro-arc consists, for example, in the special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some body design details painted in "white-gold metal".
In the interior, the retro drawing is noticeably smaller: it is largely distinguished by the gray-blue range of design, new chairs with extended range of electro-regulations and black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case as a gift and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant specialists Porsche Exclusive did not touch: the retro-targa in characteristics quite coincides with the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharging volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither the volume nor the price of each particular sports car is disclosed.
Facebook and advertising blockers have launched an “armament race”
The recent introduction of Facebook’s technology to prevent ads from being hidden on social network pages has provoked developers of solutions to block ads in response.
AdBlock Plus has released an "antidote", but Facebook plans to soon make it useless.
So AdBlock Plus promoted its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the AdBlock Plus solution, along with commercial ads, blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the problem soon.
As a source among the developers of the social network told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "armament race", trying to beat each other, the affected party became users who missed interesting records from friends or saw advertisements where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of advertising blocking have caused hot controversy lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will face trial in Murmansk.
The case has been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in the Murmansk region.
The charges against the 54-year-old man are very serious – committing violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015 the accused in the district of Pavlov Street in Murmansk committed acts of sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for the maximum penalty in the form of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia the crossover Fengguang 370 and the pickup Rich New - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the increasingly popular car class in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the pickup Rich New.
Many Western firms decided to ignore the Moscow International Auto Show this year, so the emptiness of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views on the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting innovations in the near future.
One of them will be the crossover Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand rubles. at the current rate).
For Russians, such a price is unlikely to shine, and the issue of supplies to our country is still in the discussion.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 in the results of June sales managed to reach the 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivan, although due to the large road length (175 mm) and protective plastic envelope on the lower perimeter of the body it can be counted as crossovers.
Crosswen is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370-th has the same wheel base of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden boards, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the central console shown in the photo was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossover, and the cars with "music" were easier to sell.
Five of the seven landing seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, with a maximum luggage capacity of 1500 l.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - 1.5 litre gasoline "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 hp, coupled with a 5-speed mechanical gearbox.
About the dynamic qualities of the machine, the manufacturer modestly silences, but promises a budget-saving owner's appetite at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a familiar to the Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly refined Chinese stylists design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New will interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become excessively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: 2.4 liters of gasoline (137 hp) or 2.5 liters of turbo diesel (116 hp).
The gearbox - only mechanics, drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a tightly connected "front".
Will be on the stand Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere representative of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minvan-like crossovers in the Chinese market is becoming more and more, some of the latest novels - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian lineup Dongfeng consists of two models: the sedan S30 and the hatchback H30 Cross.
During the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese firm sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on the transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications on property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed for years: in the summer and autumn they receive mail receipts for payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, many will not be able to wait this year.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate without excessive noise changed the procedure for notification of citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Cabinet of the taxpayer" on the official website of the agency nalog.ru, notices will come in electronic form.
In the inspection automatically considered such Russians online users and removed them from the standard, "paper" newsletter.
This will affect all vehicle and property owners.
Everyone else will still receive the usual letters.
However, the possibility to return to the old scheme is also available to the owners of the account on the site.
In order to do this, they will have to visit the tax department during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after compilation, while the letter will go a few days and can be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in the "personal office" for a one-time service and long forgot about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal account of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally at any department of the tax inspectorate (regardless of the place of registration).
In this year, the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the upgrades are aimed at achieving very high yields, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who took up a modification of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying squad with the aerodynamics of the tank and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helic", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight" opens.
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is able to roll in 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from average speeds are probably given to him significantly better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km / h, then the tuning all-road car with the deactivated electronic "collar" is able to press 250 km / h.
Externally, the car is virtually indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheel discs - 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking 6-metre concept coupe, which will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green subbrand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
At least four environmental innovations are expected in the coming years.
