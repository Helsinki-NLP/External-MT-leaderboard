Yeah, she wants to...
"Beautiful Munich" in 2018!
In the afternoon, our candidates will have another surprise: they will not be fighting the romantic candlelight shoot in front of MY SOLARIS alone, but alongside male model Fabian!
Flirting, flirting, seducing - not easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when you have a friend waiting in Germany.
Yet the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates are shooting with People photographer Tuan and defying wind, spark and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot is in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil to come back
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel does not see any basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement", Grindel said in the "Bild-Zeitung" football podcast "Phrasenmoher".
Despite months of debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case up to a certain point", said Grindel.
The 29-year-old announced his retirement from the DFB team in July, also citing Grindel's failure to defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put pressure on anyone, but he knows from football that "when you leave a team or you change clubs, you talk to your coach about it and I think it's a shame that this conversation hasn't happened yet".
Linz: Garden hut in the Schrebergarten settlement burned down
At 2:13 p.m., the professional fire department in Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was delayed.
The professional firefighters went out and found the hut on fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed almost entirely and the debris removed to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had turned on a battery at noon.
That could be the cause of the fire.
Anyway, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of maximum fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
It must have been considerable, though, for the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What could have prompted Lindsay Lohan to take this most bizarre action?
She was apparently trying to snatch the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live how she's apparently trying to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial clip of the stream.
You're watching "Kiss for Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan.
The video shows Lohan getting out of a car and walking to a family that may be homeless, which she claims is a Syrian refugee family.
When the family is on the run from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking children.
She doesn't provide any evidence for any of that in the video.
"The whole world is watching", Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to chase the family down the street.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from their parents.
Eventually, though, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
Looks like she's turning around and she's missing a punch.
The actress says she is shocked and she keeps her mouth shut.
What motivated Lohan to do this is currently unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This mission has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It's supposed to be getting close enough to the asteroid Ryugu to suck up material from its surface and bring it back to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign Tickers: The death toll in Sulawesi has risen to more than 400
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale and was followed by a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, claimed at least 420 lives.
The casualties could rise even further.
Rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla's chairman
It started with a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused a stir in the stock markets in early August when he announced the electric carmaker's withdrawal.
The SEC sued him for fraud, but now they've agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is stepping down from the board, but he's allowed to remain chairman.
The British Conservative Party
The Tory Party Congress - under close surveillance
Birmingham is becoming the scene of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, front-line ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new name for the country
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but it is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia and the people are voting on it this Sunday - is that all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" - meaning the one who is not - is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents himself as an anti-system candidate and is leading the polls.
His most vocal rival is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labour Party.
Audi: 'Dieselgate' is taking longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still there", said Peter Mertens, the development manager, to the industry magazine "Automobileweek".
The jailed and on leave Audi chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
'All engine/transmission combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018', he said at the time.
Mr Mertens said: 'At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We've completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was established in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" to ensure that such a scandal never happened again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to continue the discussion this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false emission figures after the emissions scams became known.
He knew about the manipulation or ignored it.
Currently, Sales Director Bram Schot is leading the company as acting CEO.
The changeover to the new WLTP standard for exhaust and consumption tests has led to production failures at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the Audi A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult", he said.
Shot is focusing on electric mobility.
The first Audi electric car, the e-tron, has already received 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to the DFB board
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism he has received in the wake of the World Cup withdrawal and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel is seeking to run for the office of DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and I try to do it as well as I can", Grindel said as a guest in the ZDF's "Actuelle Sportstudio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, and I'm going to do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "strange" if, after the bid for the 2024 European Football Championship, he did not "have the desire to participate in the future project".
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown in the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote is due at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future chief organiser of the European Council, Philipp Lahm, will be a member of the DFB's board of directors, according to Grindel.
'I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he will continue to advise the Bureau in this role in the future and then, of course, he will be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting matters,' said Grindel.
He refused to participate in speculation about whether Lahm could be his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, the office is held by Cacau and Celia Sasic, who are both native Brazilians and have family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background makes a significant contribution to society and football and says 'this is an important issue, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration needs to work", Grindel said.
Weighing the Weight Right With a Semi-Smart Scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat.
Muscle and bone mass can also indicate it.
Body mass index is also calculated by this thing, but it's more for sausages.
He's not gonna testify about me replacing fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear start for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won without any problems with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points) from Ludwigsburg also showed an impressive performance in front of 9113 spectators during his debut in a compulsory match.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the leading scorer with 24 points.
The Würzburg professor Gabriel Olaseni came up with 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the leading scorer with 24 points for the team under coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New game director Will Cummings beat the Oldenburgers by 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schroeder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the Baskets quickly set the record straight.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gulen supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship", he said.
The opening of the Ditib Mosque had partly closed down the Cologne city centre.
Several thousand policemen were on the scene - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is under criticism because it is seen as an extension of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: stars, cries and scare
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been calling for greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can", Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night before some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here. It's a dream.
Cardi B was wearing a red outfit with fringe and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and aid organizations, also appeared on stage for the hour-long performance.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of terror as many onlookers mistaken the sound of a falling metal barrier for gunfire, became frightened and tried to flee.
Soon, panic ensued, and people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
But then the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the crowd down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone", Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival concert were available for free on the Internet, as they are every year.
To get one, people had to read and share on the Internet texts, photos, and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
The crowd cheered and applauded the numerous musicians and actors, while Republican Senator Jeff Flake was applauded.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Social Fund, which is a Community instrument for the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women.
But on Friday, Flake had spoken in the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, upsetting many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted in an elevator on his way to a committee meeting by two women who, according to their own accounts, had experienced sexual assault.
"You can come with me in an elevator anytime", Flake told the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt wasn't the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had caused a great disturbance, which was unacceptable.
That's why he had bodyguards bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is true whether or not there is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or supporting or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Recently, the cases of the jailed journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were released and allowed to return to Germany, but they are still being tried in Turkey.
Florian David Fitz is drunk with Ina Müller
Fresh and handsome, his fans usually know him as Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, because that's Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub "Schellfischposten".
The host, Ina Müller, offers her guests some beer, some wine or even high-profile drinks to liven up the mood and tongues.
Many celebrities are also encouraged to sing the obligatory parts.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz, known for such films as "Hearts of Men", "Terror - Your Judgment", and "The Most Exciting Day".
The Munich man did not fare well on the trip to the far north.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a bad hangover.
He posted some of the less-than-serious insights he'd gained to his fans: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule number two, never drink the black sauce.
And the spritz.
And the round of eggnog Ina throws at 2:30, leave out too.
The 43-year-old's drinking is truly on his face.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably most effective - headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the night of drinking is not known.
But since she's been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
A beer with Ina Muller.
Treysa has been battling vandalism and disorder
The entrance to the 36-kilometer-long railway cycle path in the Red-headed Country of Treysa is difficult to find and is marred.
Recipes for rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage, trash bins, and now dismantled signs - this is how the group has been getting started on the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the flagship railway track in Red-headed Country, it's a sight beyond praiseworthy.
The issue has been a concern for members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also for others for some time now, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from relocating the seating area to regularly emptying the waste bins and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of any further activities", says Wüstenhagen.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the costs of the new measures.
It is not just the garbage that drives cyclists and residents around - the sit-down is a regular weekend gathering place for celebration.
Not only is it often loud, but the floors are also destroyed: poles torn from the ground, garbage cans demolished, signs flipped over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says Susanne Klippert, a member of the ADFC.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community.
They're upset that the bike path is a meeting place for drunk people.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle route", confirms the cycling official, who is now also looking after the new cycle centre in Goegenhain, which is opening today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it'll be really expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may raise the threshold for seizing public property significantly.
That would, however, require a police raid to pass in due time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haasse hill to be developed.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path is very satisfactory.
The tourist marketing is still expanding.
Our bike path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany", say the ADFC members.
The situation in Ascheröder Street in Treysa is considered by ADFC member Susanne Klippert to be a very critical area.
There's no turn on the haystack.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two-way traffic", she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially children.
Music contest at the cultural station: the "Kö from Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
The appeal of the "Hiltrup" district campaign is to perform "a song for Hiltrup" in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering over coffee and cake by the volunteers of the cultural railway station.
Seven formations took part, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albanian who has lived in Hiltrup for a long time, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, as district mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of town.
What did the writers see themselves as?
The places mentioned most frequently were Hiltruper See and Market Alley.
Rolf Ihmig cut the alley in his hit song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also honoured.
It was always about the experience of being together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints on their work.
So Humberg was told that he had studied chemistry, but now he was teaching guitar.
Franke knew about the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, who recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has been putting a bunch of them on YouTube.
"It's not about winning", Franke had said.
In fact, all the participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
But there was something special for the jury favorites - so that others could hear their songs.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his heltrup-schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again at the final - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good", as Franke said.
The judges were guided by the aspects of originality, reference to the help group, the melody's coherence and its recognition value.
The jury was composed of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium, Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The event was organised by the Quarter Offensive on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be-crowded cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams, sitting opposite each other.
For each page, there's a viewfinder, with four keyword cards inside, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red slide - once you've put them in.
This ensures that the other party cannot read anything even by accident.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1.
The second window.
The third dice.
The fourth is firm".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because it's not about the concepts, it's about the codes.
One player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that says maybe "3.4.2".
The idea of Decrypto is not to guess the terms behind the secret leaflet, but to guess their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe the terms "cube", "stick" and "window" in this order and in this example, so that his own team can recognize the correct order and the opposing team can't, because that's what the game wins when he manages to crack the code twice.
So the cryptographer notes and reads aloud: "throw" for the dice, "los" as opposed to "fix", and of course, something like "party" would be possible here, and "Prag" because he was careful in school and knows the window-fall there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side, but you can better align them with any clues the encryption guy gives you.
So, the descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, or you'll be making things unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic part of decrypting is the rule book, unfortunately.
The players will probably have to study it quite a long time and thoroughly before they can finally play.
The video explaining it at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you start, you will be amazed at how much emotion is involved in this seemingly unremarkable game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're just trying to guess and not win points, you can easily come up with a version for two.
Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in pub
A 48-year-old man doubled the number of people at the police inspection in Kulmbach on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper Town, then later he was also noticed in a pub in the Upper Town when he was harassing other guests.
After failing to comply with the police's order to leave the scene while clearly intoxicated, he had to spend the night in the police inspection office in Kulmbach.
In a sober state, he must also be held criminally responsible for the use of badges of unconstitutional organizations.
The factory Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The Pressig railway works was the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers were banging on buffers, you could hear it in a whisper", recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the town and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the cars squeaked.
That was a railroad.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's home town of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald has a place been so shaped by the railroad.
This was the starting point of the steep-ramped mountain route to the north, which culminates in Steinbach am Wald after a climb of about 220 metres.
To cope with this, formerly, draw-and-draw-blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, driving instruction and railway mastery.
"The centerpiece was the lathe, which after a rebuild in 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres", says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
The railway company Pressig, which was transferred to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the adjacent lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockholm - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steamers and eight ellocks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shuttle blocks.
From 1977 onwards they were only used on freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were still graded per month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were dismantled, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that no better use of the site has been envisaged, including in terms of freight traffic".
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate held a pompous station party in Pressig on the day of Pentecost 1989.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here", recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig Ranger Station was history.
"The most difficult jobs in the train traffic were done by the rangers and the railway trainers", recalls Dinkel.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with a start at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winners Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the Beijing tennis tournament, as did Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6-2 against Kristina Mladenovic from France.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the number 13 Russian gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
The organizers and visitors were greatly relieved to see the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open air of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate in Mittelehrenbach.
It is organised under the auspices of the Tourist Association "Rund um Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 works by 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
The artists were welcomed by Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann, the artistic director, at the opening of the opening.
He's been here since the first lesson.
So did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as both the main organizer and the artist.
But surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in the hands of young, experienced people with good prospects for the future.
Both have previously been active in the selection of artists and in the design of flyers.
This year, again, for the occasion of Art & Enjoyment, they are issuing a special 70-cent stamp, which they designed and which is available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted at the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was recruited for the musical framing.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, he quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are metal or ceramic artworks, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "luck tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, brightly lit, playfully equipped with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes, and 24 aluminum tubes as a soundtrack.
With the sun shining through the bushes in the background, the object seems fairy-tale-like and invites to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Washneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years of K&G.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
In the middle of the tour Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imaginary figures made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "windshow performance" is included in the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition is open until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday with celebration
1968 was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albaceteans were also upset.
At least five of them.
They were not willing to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has become a legend: On a bench in the tin bush, they lifted the MGV 68 Albacht from the baptismal font.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the jubilee was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today", President Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
150 guests were present, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the foundation festival for the anniversary.
It was a tradition for years, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
A fancy ball was there, to which festive clothing had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Meeting", but were seated at comfortable tables.
In the meantime, there was a lot of movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It was an honor for the singers of MGV 68 Albachten to make their own voice heard.
Happinessful songs were appropriate for the occasion.
Almost like, "A day like this, as beautiful as today".
To match the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine".
In reference to another cool drink, he said, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin word for "hope".
Once again, the choir was led by Richard Homann, one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction", said Holstiege. "He has such a light style, it's a masterpiece he performs".
The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
And then there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at his desk until three in the morning, creating his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented a fine-sounding poetry.
There was a big raffle too.
The proceeds will be used to fund a visit to the All-Weather Zoo for the children of the Albatross Youth Center.

Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The Ascender is marching.
Three games, three wins, the USC Münster reserve under the auspices of Axel Büring is doing really well in League Three.
No sign of fear or frack sauce, the Independents are doing their thing.
And that's a very good result at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"It was not clear, but we made an impression", says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied".
The evening at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer was good, the game was good.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third movement, the guests had a movement ball.
"If they get it to the finish, it can be a game that's overturned", says Büring from years of experience.
Finally, USC with its routine forces, made it through and reached full yield.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like this.
That's not gonna break our necks.
I've seen really good volleyball at times", Annacker did not hesitate with the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey for the Independents is going seems unpredictable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that", says Axel Büring.
Only one is where he feels affirmed: "The Third League is at an incredibly good level.
They don't want to look down at the fourth league anyway.
If the vest doesn't get dirty in the next few weeks, they'll have to look up.
But the first balance sheet can only be drawn up after ten or eleven games.
We're going to Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee will take office in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the Dream Ship.
Now she's openly talking about how the show may have had some complicity in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the head hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star may have been partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been one reason.
I grew up with this job, travelled the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admiring colleagues took me at their eye level", Keller told Bild am Sonntag.
At first she was always just "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "Dream Ship".
Because now the only other people the reporters called were Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much".
She believes that her husband at the time may have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans was reluctant to discuss problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried to be the one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I faked it", she explains.
She always felt like she wasn't good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid it might go wrong a second time".
The day before the wedding I was crying in the closet and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love as it was in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I've been way too naive about love".
The night butterfly, which regularly explores the city's nightlife at the ZFF, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but it's a little light-scared.
And the glow of a green carpet on the six-story plaza blinds him beyond measure.
But it's a film festival, and there are more or less celebrities who want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he's wandering across the square late Thursday night to relax in the "Aquaclean-Toilet-Oase".
The public toilet, sponsored by a large sanitary company and celebrating its premiere at the festival, is called the "Need Centre" in the ground floor of a new pavilion, and it is trying hard to create a luxurious ambience.
But tonight, for some reason, the Oasis of the Gods is a heaven.
So, out here, across the street, the guests who just had the best entertainment at the opening of the Green Book movie in the cinema next door, are celebrating the festival's opening with a party at the three-story department store, as they do every year.
The name of the festival is perfectly appropriate , as the works shown come from all over the world .
What you don't have to do is write an article about this festival and you don't want to be caught in the cross-promotion of its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a bundle around its tentacles, which a good fairy has given it, and two bulky doormen actually generously wave it in.
Inside, guests rush in, dancing to live music late into the night or being played by DJs, who yell at each other, and flush down exquisite bites with Cüpli.
In the basement of the delicatessen store, oysters are waiting for mouths to swallow, and next to them the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbling.
And the thing is, all the sales shelves full of exclusive products haven't been cleared for the occasion.
It's been going on for years, so it seems to be working without any major losses.
You gotta love this country for that!
The butterfly is studying the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If those are two separate instructions, he's got the dress code wrong.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly saved lives.
In the upstairs household department, the chicken is pouring an espresso cocktail called "Golden Eye", which matches the festival award.
The price of the best drink is not necessarily the same as the mix that a capsule manufacturer presents itself with.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising the brand for years, is not here that night either.
But between local celebrity, cash registers and kitchen items, a familiar face comes along: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor shouldn't be far.
And in fact, Viggo Mortensen, now in his early sixties, walks through the crowd, almost like a choirboy.
It's not a trick, not a skill, it's a stolen shot.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as a form of clinging, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is happy about his team's victory.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home of Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia rhythms with a player in the booth, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second-tier team had defeated the Leones Negros on Saturday with a score of 2-0.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV Sending after last-minute plays "destroyed to the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly for long periods, the senders, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept through", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts led quickly with 8-1, and the early break that Bieletsky had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then all of a sudden there was a shake-up", Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
At half-time, the deficit was only two more goals.
The best of the bunch, Marius Hintze, met in the phase one after the other.
After the change, it got even better from the visitors' point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was out at 15:15, after which the reliever led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three-shot (29:26).
And then what?
The impartial intervened.
Bieletsky usually avoids looking for the blame on others.
But the 120-second time-out that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was a joke.
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought well, even against seven men, and they kept throwing the ball to the empty goal.
Only they can't buy themselves for the compliments.
"Now we must have a bloody victory", said the restless Bieletsky.
The following are the results of the preliminary examination of the results of the preliminary examination:

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old girl from Naila (Regional Court), police are searching for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, a road was dug up near Marxgrün.
The road surface and several layers of road debris were removed, police and prosecutors said.
New evidence suggests that the missing woman may have been buried not far from her former residence.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
The investigators didn't rule out a crime either.
Since last year, the Hof Criminal Police, together with the prosecutor's office, has reportedly been working intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monuments Protection Authority, the investigators used a ground radar to detect a strange object under the road near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained to smell human bones, officials narrowed the area down to a few feet.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the course of the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users reveals the dangers lurking on the web.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped the threat of his removal as CEO of the multibillion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled out of court a lawsuit over misleading Twitter posts that could have cost Musk his license to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, plus Musk will step down as chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German supervisory board.
He can stay on board.
In the comparison, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous executive in Manhattan federal court for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk had to explain that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company public, paying $420 per share, if funding was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at $72 billion.
Musk later backed down: Tesla stays on the stock exchange.
Under the deal, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also establish a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 at the Chelsea
Liverpool have come back from a 1-1 draw at Chelsea.
In the top game at FC Chelsea, the striker just replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp in the 89th minute for the 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins at the start, Liverpool dropped back to second place.
Chelsea remain third, the new top scorer is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard scored his sixth goal of the season in the 25th minute to give Chelsea the lead.
After that, the Klopp team missed the tie several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared after a solo by Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge saved the Reds with a corner kick.
Manchester United, the record-breaking club, is in a deep crisis after its worst start to a season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United with a 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days of play only in the midfield of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29) and Sergio Aguero (65) 2:0 against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0 lead, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new top rider.
Let's Dance jury Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has apparently separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now divorced.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Content) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated amicably and mutually", lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser told BamS.
The two of them are now concerned about the welfare of their two daughters.
The couple had met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later, according to the report.
Joachim Llambi is from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his work as a judge on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment shows.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, the GroKo is taking several polling shots.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is being criticized.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly poll of the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD is up by one to 17 percent, the SPD is down by one point compared to the previous week and is down to 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU are also losing a count and only reaching 27%.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens are 15 percent, the Left 11 percent, and the FDP 10 percent.
If Sunday's parliamentary elections were held, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, get only 43 percent of the vote.
The large coalition has thus lost its majority in the Sunday question at all the major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties consistently get between 43 and 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they collectively received 53.4 percent.
The other parties are also wide-ranging: the AfD, the second largest party in several polls, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens are getting between 12.5 and 17 percent of the vote.
The left is averaging 10 percent, the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of the vote.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48% of citizens think Merkel is the right candidate for the Chancellor's office, according to the BamS-commissioned Emnid poll.
According to the survey, only one in two (50%) currently wishes the grand coalition to hold until the next regular parliamentary election in three years, 41% are in favour of a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday also showed a significant drop in Merkel's popularity.
The Germans are divided over whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against, according to Emnid.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
A posh at Aldi: reduced price for love
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
If anyone says there are no more romantic dating stories in Tinder's time, they should talk about turkey meat at Aldi's.
Munich - In an age of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is a meeting place for great love, radiating an almost anachronistic romance.
Yeah, right, a conversation about reduced turkey, boxer shorts on the roasting table or favorite pudding is doubtless still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less of a contact but more of a slippery exchange.
We've taken the test: How do women react when you don't talk about the hot stuff for a long time right after the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
It has the potential for a Hollywood love story when the love story is preceded by a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then also reports to his lovers at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is to be hoped that the author of this advertisement at an unknown Aldi branch will also find the man of her dreams, with whom she briefly discussed "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For her belief in the magic of analog dating, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 caps for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger School has been participating in the campaign "Dickels against Polio - 500 Dickels for a Life Without Paralysis".
Polio is short for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, known in German as childhood paralysis, can lead to paralysis and death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be extinct, but there are three other countries in the world where the disease is present.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the poliovirus, can only be contained by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for a pause for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate over Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us", said Reus, who is friends with idols, after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at Sky TV.
Zorc had already insisted before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract negotiations with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach is not in a hurry to extend his contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even discussed a contract yet.
There's no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be a time when we sit down and talk", Eberl said on Sunday night on Sky TV.
Football: District League: Researchers' performance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this season when Alois Fetsch was still young, when he went to court with his tough-guy.
The coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, he gave himself a word, withdrew at first (internally) to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
It's going around the corner on Brandhove Road.
The freshest evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the previous season only scraped by the ascent.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
Fetsch praised his boys and went to each one after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscle problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1, with Niklas Thewes in the front waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had a lot more stakes in the first half.
And the odds.
But Frerichs before his exit (17), the newcomer Luca Rehberg (26), and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
That almost paid off when the SCA in the 41st minute twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously hit up in front of the Wolbecker box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his art.
After the break, the VfL took complete control.
Thewes from 18 meters nearly failed.
Schroer was also late for a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left again missed a fresh cell treatment.
When Altenrheines' Chris Naberbäumer knocked Robin Westhues down in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 metres outside the guest house.
The foul-mouthed man himself came forward and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues' thing with the right flap hit in the bottom left from the shooter's view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be a long time.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck, in the 80th minute, unfortunately, flew the leather in the penalty area.
The referee, Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm), immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to overcome tight minutes in the final stage before Geske had the winning shot on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it was too much of a good thing.
The following are the names of the Member States which have adopted the measures:

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover '96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure the first home win.
Standout Ante Rebic, who was in the starting eleven for the first time after an injury, was supposed to help.
Also midfielder Luca Torró was back after a hamstring injury and should prevent the SGE to score more goals according to standards with his headball strength.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
The accident happened on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, a drama took place at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
Turbulence occurred during the landing of a helicopter, as police confirmed to OO24.
The helicopter was caught in a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill laterally.
Police, fire and rescue services were immediately alerted.
The emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident with a large order.
The ÖAMTC helicopter was also called in as a precaution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, it turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to walk home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident are still unknown and are the subject of an investigation.
According to fire department spokesman Franz Resperger, the fire was small, but was quickly put out.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
This means that only 8 percent of the board members were women as of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and was submitted in advance to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to change their approach, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by", said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the United States, Britain and Sweden, with few exceptions, all-male management teams are no longer conceivable.
The lag makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and forward-looking.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German listed companies was also due solely to positive incentives for companies in the medium value index (MDax).
In fact, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are women.
However, the figure was 3.8 per cent last year.
The 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - had a stagnant share of women.
Last time, 26 women were on the board.
"I am sure that Dax companies will recruit women again in the coming year - in their own interest", Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have indicated that they will not continue to commit to increasing the share from the previous 'zero percent'.
The number of women on the supervisory boards was 30.5 percent on 1 September - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year earlier.
"If women were recruited to board positions every year, the figure would reach 40 percent by 2023", says the report.
Some even make a mess: luxury cars: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
The best is Ferrari.
The Italians are making 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: That slogan still holds true today - in most cases.
Who among the elite dealers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers earn per car they sell?
This question has been studied by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros per car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of money on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well ahead with prices averaging between €33,000 and €38,000 per car and around €3,000 in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

Torchlight to open the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight.
For the 60th time, the association is organizing the wine festivals, which will take place every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Straße.
To mark the start of the anniversary, the officials moved through the village to the main square, under the sounds of the game men's march from Wiesenbronn.
In the already crowded festival tent, the chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz, and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "Sixty years of arranging something like this - that's a crazy feat for a small town of 800 inhabitants.
This is something to be proud of", Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later symbolically jumped off the stage with the guests.
"It's good to see so many people have found their way back to us after the downwind". Later, "The Troglauer" set the mood.
On Sunday, the day of the Abtswinder consecration, the association had set the afternoon drinks prices as they had been 60 years ago.
A feast evening for the 60th Wine Festival will be held on Friday, October 5, in the guest's home, before the second round takes place a day later in the Festival Tent.

The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance had run a red light on Saturday afternoon with a blue light and Martinshorn.
He then ran into the taxi at a crossroads, which was driving at Green.
The ambulance crashed into a traffic light and a tree after the collision.
He caught the passenger, who died at the scene.
Ambulance driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the ambulance driver were seriously injured and trapped in their vehicles and had to be rescued by emergency services.
The 29-year-old paramedic, who was also badly injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian was unable to help her.
Another emergency doctor tried to do so - but to no avail.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police are working closely with the Bonn prosecutor's office to determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, we're uncomfortable for Mourinho
After the embarrassing knockout in the League Cup, Manchester United now lose in the seventh round of the Premier League.
The way in which they will be defeated is yet to be discussed.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3-1, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
When they suspected an offside from Mark Nobel's pass, all the Manchester defenders stopped, and left Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball to the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a performance which had been already largely inadequate.
The mood is quite different at present among United's city rivals Manchester City.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, came up against Brighton & Hove Albion with a safe 2-0 win.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defensive barrier of the away team for the first time.
Sergio Aguero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer in the lead
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As in the Cup final, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came on in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his shot.
So after the Reds started the week with a perfect record, Chelsea was unbeatable for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jurgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and then the Blues knocked Liverpool out of the league table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2:0 victories.
The Gunners fans, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success against the surprise Hertfordshire team.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately kicked a goal from Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal have now moved past Watford with a fifth consecutive win and are now just behind their great rival Tottenham in fifth place.
The Wolves went 2-0 to Southampton in the league for the fifth consecutive time and are in eighth place.
VW's core brand missing: Paris motor show in the wake of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
The diesel scandal and the fight over driving bans and retrofits are not likely to let the German car companies off their leash at the Paris industry meeting.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showcasing their newest cars in the French capital next week, along with the competition from all over the world.
Diesel is not really a big part of it anymore.
The possible replacement and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are likely to be an important topic, at least behind the glossy scenes of the exhibition booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models with them: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart in 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to launch until 2021.
The new 3 is the centerpiece of Paris.
This year, from 4 to 14 October, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented.
In addition to car manufacturers, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were well over a million visitors.
The massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi have killed at least 380 people.
Dozens are still missing.
And there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake was 5.9 on the Richter scale, the second 7.4 on the Richter scale.
Communications and transport links are damaged, and there has been enormous property damage.
After the quakes, the tsunami struck the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
The number of victims is expected to rise significantly.
The numbers are only from Palu.
But many other communities along Sulawesi's west coast are also affected.
About 150 bikers are celebrating church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated Sunday with a team of helpers the final service for motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of the PS-strong two-wheeler.
Between April and September, the traditional Motorcycle God service (MoGo) is held at Nordhelle House on the last Sunday of each month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, about 150 bikers had gathered for a far from ordinary service on Sunday.
By 10 o'clock, the buses were lined up in front of the church entrance.
First, the program included the biker breakfast, which could be enhanced with coffee and cake or even a delicious curry sausage.
Along with the MoGo team were the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was delivered during the Biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical background was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and calm", says pastor Frank Schröder.
Yesterday was certainly another milestone in the history of motorcycle worship.
The local club is celebrating: after the apple comes the milk
And on the day of the actual action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished audience, step by step, the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle, the apples became a fine crushed mass.
Many of the children could not yet imagine how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But even this important step of work they were able to see on that late Friday afternoon.
Packed into shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg piled the little apples layer by layer, which looked a little like a piece of meat.
Thanks to some technical support, the final step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran slowly into a large vessel.
But the farmer from Füchtorf also had ready-made specialties with him.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest white feather to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchdorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got to talk, while the children not only followed the process of apple pressing but also discovered the built-up hopper for themselves.
The festival was also attended by members of the Füchtorfer Kameradschaft of former soldiers, who invited them to play games at some stations.
The home club will also be offering an action day next year.
Then, however, stressed Gregor Krützkamp, the home in the heart of the savings village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious from the subject: it will be about milk after all.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth playoff of the season: "Bastard situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and encouraged them.
However, there were not many positive results at 1:4 (0:2) of the last place in the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out of it as a team", said 96-year-old professional footballer Pirmin Schwegler, and then added: "Of course, this is disappointing, because you always do a lot".
The Lower Saxony, which was followed by only Florent Muslija (86), is at the bottom of the table with two counters and is a candidate for relegation in its current form.
Led by the superb Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka scored in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful qualifying round for the Europa League match against Lazio Roma.
Croatia's vice-champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of Hesse in his starting debut and was never able to get a grip on Hannover's defence.
The striker, who was beaten for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his pace and ability to assert himself why he is so valuable for the squad.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool, was also in the starting line-up for the first time.
A head-ball from Lucas Torró (17) was the first to pose a danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last minute by the 96ers for the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term outgoing Kevin Wimmer (back).
The lead for the householders fell almost inevitably and completely deservedly.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defended corner, Haller extended it head-on in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender who came from French second-tier side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still in the middle of the break.
This time Haller suited up for his attack partner Rebic, who was skilfully refueling and did not give 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser a chance.
In the half, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his XI and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Dutch were now a little more daring, but they didn't have any ideas until just before the end when they finally got the final score.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then crossed over to De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show run for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, even Jovic hit a minute before the end.
Morlaix Square is becoming a party mile
Despite the cool temperatures, the atmosphere was good at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The celebration takes place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, which dates back to the Thirty Years' War and which, according to legend, was shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood was leaking from the gunshot wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the Christ shot, which then led to the building of the Holy Cross Church.
It is still unfinished, only the altar room remains, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort, and life.
The church service was poorly attended, despite its importance to the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the final blessing ended the church part of the Feast of the Cross.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the Catholic parish for the secular part of the feast.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather-adapted farmhouse ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours of the town church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish community, informed the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will be delayed until next year.
After the scaffolding had been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has been found, which was only possible with the opening by scaffolding.
The ground cleaning work is complete, the natural stone work is due to start before winter, and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Opening of a new residential building in Neu-Ulm
The Donau-Iller Life Assistance is opening a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" in the Münsterblickstraße is now being dedicated - this was the unanimous opinion of all present at the dedication.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair users who have been living in the Donau-Iller life-assistance home for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas were taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army Officer Building was put on the test bench for the Handycap residents: "The house was old and outdated in its furnishings", Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the bulldozers came to tear the house down.
The architect said that the new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable.
Life Assistance Donau-Iller opens a new residential home
The aid scheme invested some €4.6 million in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, while the district of Schwaben contributed 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned time and financial limits.
For this, too, he was thanked by the director of the life-assistance service, Jürgen Heinz.
The trade-off between an accessible and fireproof construction method has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that would allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move about without outside help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Schwaben district social administration, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need aids to be mobile".
The company's products are designed to be used in a variety of environments.
And he goes on to say, "The land in this situation is a real lucky case, because it is no longer available for purchase in the current situation".
The new residential building in Münsterblickstraße offers a total of almost 1500 square metres of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three housing groups.
Heinz, the managing director of Life Assistance, is proud of the 11 full-time staff, all of whom are employed on a payroll basis.
Germany: Sistering complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all her countrymen not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences", the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the daily newspaper Tagesspiegel am Sonntag.
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer than people in West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone, almost 30 years after German unification", said Schwesig.
North Korea: Will this clean dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan is supposed to smooth the way between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
According to Moon's office on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They reportedly passed through the border town of Panmunjom with three kilograms of dog food to help the animals "get used to it".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly bid for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile propulsion test facility.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months this year, has seen the publication of numerous new books that answer this question, usually in the light of the past hundred years.
In contrast, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, explains in his magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
The Commission is also aware of the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
There has hardly been an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not chanted the mantra of "return to the task at hand".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to ask the legitimate question, what is the difference between work and work in kind, but let it be so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its task of governing, it should not be stopped by debate on the definition of the term.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties will meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel is now calling this round regularly to de-escalate conflicts early; a lesson from all the fighting.
First, however, the diesel equipment and the immigration law for skilled workers are again conflicting issues.
The CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies slip away with exchange premiums, the SPD and the CDU see the manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesel engines.
While the diesel crisis has brought the two parties closer over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled immigration law.
The SPD calls for a residence permit for rejected asylum seekers who are working or in training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'switch' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a dispute again between the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
It is not the same and the same that has joined forces to form GroKo, but three partners with very different societal views and priorities.
Fighting is good.
Without strife, a society with such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests cannot progress.
But to be constructive, a dispute must not be rebuilt on partisan grounds about the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to be in dispute - but always keeping in view the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and beneficial for many?
This key question will help to clarify both the diesel and the change of track issues in a pragmatic way - and thus restore confidence.
That is why the popular parties must fight now.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the
Minister in the crosshairs
Is the Minister of Labour in particular in breach of the current legislation?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"It's true that their legislators have been working day and night on the social security reform", a frenzied social minister told the press two weeks ago.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following:
It is assumed that the Minister was merely expressing her enthusiasm for the work of her team and that she did not intend to announce any breaches of the law in front of the cameras.
However, she now has questions to clear Hartinger of any suspicion.
Police are clearing a road in search of female bodies
Marxgrün - Lange the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained to smell old human bones, was able to narrow the relevant spot to a few metres in multiple deployments with its guide.
In addition, scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority discovered a soil anomaly in the area of the road.
For over a year now, the prosecution and the Hof Criminal Police have been working on the missing persons case.
A cycle path was repeatedly blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices because the investigators suspected that here, during the construction of the state road 30 years ago, Heike's body may have been buried.
Paint powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before that, there's a riot.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence supporters, among others, with paint powder, when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to hold a rally to honor their colleagues who were deployed at polling stations during last year's referendum, which was deemed illegal.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, it had also resorted to violence.
The Catalan police formed a chain to keep the separatist demonstrations and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 or so separatists then tried to break the police chain by throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in detention.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the coercive administration was ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Westphalia: Confusion gathered: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen are separated without a goal
Red-white Ahlen is on the move.
The match at FC Gütersloh was also a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third-to-last one turned them into a mass of confusion in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald Stadium.
The first half was pretty manageable from the entertainment factor.
So if you wanted to get a beer or a hot dog, you could do it without worry.
There was no danger of missing a chance, for there was practically none.
First shot in half an hour
The first (harmless) goal of the whole game was scored by Güterslohs Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - opportunity was for the Ahlens, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling was forced to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was to change them early.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the switch, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel scored from 18 metres just above the housing and after an hour the goods loher appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball capture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it went smoothly.
The quick counter on Sinan Aygün was "crowned" by Nick Flock (62nd) with a soft shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also hit a headball from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner ball from ex-selector Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It didn't work.
The Ahlene did not achieve anything more than optical superiority on their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have his last chance, but that too was a failure.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"We were not as dangerous as we were against Woolwicke this time, although our opponent didn't feel like playing here", said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensive "flattened everything up a bit" against a team "who just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel we could get a goal", Daut said.
But to his chagrin, the spectators didn't feel like his team could score.
The show was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Market: Luckily there are enough creamers
This is the pleasure of Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabeamt, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well".
The opening was a bright blue sky, while the square was still a little empty, but that would change as the day progressed.
"It's so nice and social here, that's why we're here today", said one visitor.
The organiser of the festival, Franz Josef Holthaus, greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a nice touch of humor.
For the Brockmanns, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer quickly stepped in.
Verena has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" was not shy about entertaining the ever-increasing number of visitors with music.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung later.
"It's just great", said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to fit the opening date into his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many assets and their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board", he said, but he thanked the men for their action.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who worked at the stands and also mentioned the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city is giving itself a colorful touch - here's what's going on.
Then the wreath of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken away with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were used for physical gain.
Everything was available, from sweet to hearty.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative with his decopier saw.
He had furnishings, beer lids with rack motifs and more.
One special offer was made by three Reckenfelder beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honeycake in a glass, with honey of my own making, of course.
Little Elsa had to go through it over and over again, the cake was so good.
It is the sociability that kept the visitors there until late in the evening, even without the stage program that is not available at the Autumn Festival.
Local political message smears: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknown persons have been advertising the construction of a skating rink in a manner that is hardly beneficial.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
At least one case has been reported to the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich" are printed in large letters on signs at Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding inscription was discovered on the sign on the staircase to the Gempt bistro.
Since the brief message was apparently left "only" with an Edding at the time, it could easily have been removed.
"A few days later, it was back up, this time sprayed", Rottmann said.
It is assumed that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is particularly noteworthy because several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skating rink is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
The Commission has already made commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city's Department of Education, Sport and Culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the smeared board.
Local politicians and government officials have been working on the issue of skateboarding for years.
After the old one at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted by a majority in favour of the fire station parking lot.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seemed to be against building on this site.
The end of June saw a turnaround.
The members of the main and financial committees voted unanimously for the Gutenberg school site.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word will be for the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that if a positive vote is cast, it could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the summer chaos in European air transport, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come", the head of the air safety union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
A major reason for the numerous delays and cancellations is the long-standing staff shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years", the unionist said.
The market for ready-to-lay lots is empty across Europe.
In the Karlsruhe centre for the surveillance of German airspace alone, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports are meeting in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional workload and overtime, you can't do it without us", said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German airline.
Maas again blamed the Lotsen misery on the EU Commission.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the measures with the internal market.
The resulting cost and staff savings in the national air traffic controls are now fully reflected in the operational business.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the costs of the transport of dangerous goods.
The EU's requirements are currently being harmonised by 2024 and further tightening is feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years", said Maas.
He hopes the high costs of delays at airlines will prompt a rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a 'consensus training and future pact', said Maas.
The 120 yearly intake announced so far for the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the group.
The will of the interim CEO of Thyssenkrupp, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, is to split the failing group into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the programme to the Member States.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side has only eight members.
The ten representatives of the employees are opposite.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by an AGM in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include a 50% stake in the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, will combine its elevator and supply business.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as did about 6,000 independence supporters.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests apart with a large tender.
According to the emergency services, however, pro-independence activists repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
There were also reportedly clashes between the participants of the various protests.
According to emergency services, 24 people were injured.
Police say there have been six arrests.
Better salaries and recognition of colleagues
The police had demonstrated to honour their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia, which had been banned by the Spanish central government almost exactly a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked Manel Perez, a 55-year-old Catalan protester, to AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they screwed us over a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic policeman who wanted to be identified only with Daniel rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year did their duty: defend the law", he said.
But the demonstration is to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it's a big European city and there's more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman assured.
Panne granted access to personal data of British ministers
A security breach in a mobile app has made the personal data of ministers and members of the British Conservative Party temporarily accessible to anyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown sources after the outage was announced a day before the Tory party meeting in Birmingham.
Two people stuck on B217 .
The Hannover police report a serious traffic accident on Sunday morning on the federal road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they crashed their car into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after the top game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game that night along with the half-hour of Valencia", Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the record-breaking 3:1 (1:1) win over SSC Naples.
For the coach, the costly star, even without a goal of his own, was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo has had a lot of fun and is doing well", Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after the early gap with Dries Mertens' goal (10th minute) and temporarily put the worst pursuer off.
The Real Madrid goalkeeper initially put on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who led with a double (26./49).
Ronaldo also made the preparation for the shot by Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates", the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, wants to see goals from the striker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get better at serving him", the coach demanded.
Juve's top scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on the scoreboard.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the dominance of Juventus seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the impeccable series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has a six-count lead over Naples.
The second-placed team, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chances against Turin.
But at the latest, after the disqualification of the already warned Mario Rui (58), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the field with a yellow-red after a hard start against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Napoli", commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel touched.
The German national team player has made his mark at Juve.
The Liverpool professional played in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of Turin and is banned for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changed His Name
Rapper Kanye West has made a particularly bizarre appearance on the US television show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he'll be called "Ye".
"The entity formerly known as Kanye West", he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince as he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news, though.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with KRRL radio station, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most used word in the Bible and it means 'you'", the rapper said.
The first day of the competition.
- I got it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game today.
The opponent was simply more aggressive, and we almost never put him in trouble".
Two goals in 90 minutes, that's a lot of positive play.
The team is the second-highest scoring team in the league.
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, the first using Maik Krause from a sharp angle for early leadership (7).
Steffen could have increased Uphus in the 43rd minute, but after a great preparation by Krause, he was knocked out on free-stand.
The hosts had only one double chance when initially Moritz Höne failed to score against Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all forgave the other three.
A trade-off - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand at the goal line and saw red for it - was also not used by Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line, the game was decided (81).
"We had been harshly critical of each other before, but today was different from the last few weeks", concluded Florian Kraus.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
The goals are: 0:1 Krause (7). 0:2 Berheide (81).
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
Germany: The team's best result in the competition:
"I don't know what to make of it", he said.
"We didn't get access to them". He was probably referring to the wingers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also to all the other Green-Whites who were caught up in the collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory", he said, blinking impudently and pulling from his players, but the relief was to notice that they had pulled away with three points.
Remember, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albacht, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season", he says.
"The way we came back from 0-2, the way we held it against one of the top teams in the league for the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
It makes it all the more bitter to have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2-0 he put on the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"That was crazy, what he did", Lewandowski said, acknowledging the quality of his opponent.
Just before the side change, his own XI made the equaliser: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through to the long toreck (45).
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who made the tie (59).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crafty, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64), and just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was equal (69).
Despite the superiority, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia hit (80.).
We need to focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten is what we have to win now", Lewandowski said.
The following are the names of the two main groups of companies: Albersloh, Spangenberg, Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen, Kröger (87), Diallo, P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill, Hövelmann, Bonse (87).
The team's goals are as follows: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Fröhning (39), 2:1 McGill (45), 2:2 McGill (59), 3:2 Nübel (64), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80) and the winner of the second leg of the European Cup.
The following is the list of the Member States which have adopted the Schengen acquis:
Football: TSV Strasbourg wins against Primus
There was no winner in the Bundesliga duel between TSV Strasbourg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually come for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: The entire board of Dynamo Dresden has resigned
The entire board of the second-tier football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets in the evening referred to a joint letter from the Saxons' committee.
The association was not initially confirmed.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga player.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany is as much of a relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President spent three days in Berlin and Cologne, and many felt that he should not have been invited.
Tutzing Evangelical Academy: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Tutzing Evangelical Academy is offering about 80 seminars by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has indicated that he intends to collect the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Udo Hahn, the Academy's director, proudly acknowledged this when he said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have been with us". The fact that prominent people are always appearing at the Academy at Tutzing Castle was also a theme during the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29 the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which television presenter Dunja Hayali also receives in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings by mid-2019 will be a success.
"The pension is not secure!" is the title of one of the conferences.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarism without limits".
Gun violence, destruction, torture, death - war is a mockery of every human idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical transformation of work through digitalization.
The Academy's Director, Mr Hahn, was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to seek solutions, or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting for the 200th.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the situation in the United Kingdom, which is to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical National Church", said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Musical bar: understanding women and men with their hearts - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christchurch in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret performer, Teubner was able to create gender understanding not only through humour and warmth for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else there might be, but also through music.
She used the mini-guitar and mastered her violin.
Ben Southcrump was sitting on the wing.
He is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks to the end of the movement, and a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so harmoniously accompanied by congenial harmonies that some may have wished for a solo.
There was, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, in the way it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had introduced a paradox: A man's satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp slips in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G-mall symphony to a playful dance.
There was a great applause and a "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were presented to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, did not allow herself to be deprived of an additional thank you.
She had the idea of giving the duo a performance in Wolbeck, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.
The article "Gender Understanding with the Heart"
The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO of electric car maker Tesla, but must step down as chairman of the board.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million fine, the SEC said.
Background is Musk's surprise announcement in August of his intention to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in its suit of making false and misleading statements.
It's a mess.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised down the casualty figures.
10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All have been discharged from hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed overnight in the hospital for observation.
He will be released later today, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the crash of the bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The bus had crashed head-on into a control panel on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's National League: Ahlener SG retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"I was actually very happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We have not been able to control them", said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the final left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore trailed almost to the end, being behind at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
Only towards the end did the wider hostess's staff become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement on left-back, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
The following are the names of the Member States which have adopted the measures:
Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: BSV Ostbevern top performance in the top league at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top league, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd West League.
In the second-tier VC Allbau Essen, the Blue and Whites won 3-1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It's good to have Lenz in the top third of the league.
We have worked on that now", said coach Dominik Münch after his team's almost impeccable performance in the crashed leader.
The first passage was almost as if the guests were dominating.
At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the double bar, but has not come into play.
We've kept them busy.
Our opponent has taken a risk, but he has also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Eating has changed the assumption to triangles.
We couldn't keep the pressure up.
Food sucked in, and we got a little carried away", Münch continued.
At 18:17 the Ruhr volleyball players were in the lead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern defended four more sets at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was now a class better", the exercise leader said of the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge, with their additions, contributed significantly to the fact that BSV turned the page in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "We played consistently and calmly".
At 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue and White brought in four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had a great day too.
The following are the names of the women who have been awarded the BSV: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of pieces in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be painstakingly reassembled", TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu told the German news network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' affiliation to Germany alongside top German politicians, Erdogan used the appointment for his own purposes", Sofuoglu lamented.
The broad exclusion of the German public "has strengthened many reservations".
Home club Nottuln: The offer has already been established
After a long summer break, it's finally time for folk music.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 19.30 the Nottuln home club is already holding its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace of the Old Office.
It is almost exactly one year since we held our first folk gathering.
This event has now become a permanent part of the musical calendar in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln home club.
I did not expect our meeting to take place so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was the stormy Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace of the office was always full.
"The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, nomadic and seafaring songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits", says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
For the first folk hit "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has promised with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff gladly remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frosche in der Nacht" delighted the audience and sent home with a worm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening", says the invitation from the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to join in.
Since the desired seats are always quickly filled, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but the entrance is already at 7.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be cleared by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
The merger, which is worth billions, still has to be approved in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - in the United States.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
A gala was held in the Dr. Stammberger Hall to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the establishment of the District Association for Horticulture and Land Management.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the District Association for Horticulture and Landscape Culmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbach clubhouse, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbach town hall on Saturday evening.
However, it was called something else at the time: as "District Fruit-Growing Association of Kulmbach City and Country", it was dissolved by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the orchard association was also different from today's work - it was really all about the orchard, about flowers and gardening nobody thought about then.
"At that time, in the age of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite of the elite", explained district administrator Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees were to line long roads, and so-called industrial gardens were to be planted at schools.
Fruit farming is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But this is far from exhausting the spectrum.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of a number of initiatives to promote the development of the European audiovisual sector.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwürfe" entertained by showing on the stage how varied the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age", said the district chairman, Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut harvesting was a huge thing for us kids, I doubt that you can collect much joy with smartphones and so on.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with councillor Klaus Peter Söllner.
"The district association decides where they are to be", added Landrat Söllner, stressing the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county was not left in doubt by district manager and expert consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He gave a picture lecture to the many visitors, explaining the long history of the district association and, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the old days, everything came from the garden, and for the winter it was stuffed in.
However, by the end of the 1950s the garden had become a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature is enduring, it was here before us and we must learn from it", argued the expert on fruit and nut trees.
This is why the horticultural associations are encouraged to keep up the effort so that our home will remain beautiful and liveable.
This also includes welcoming new citizens into our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We must stop the dramatic decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren", concluded Günter Reif at the successful event, which was solemnly framed by the tower blower of the Thurnau Music Club.

Priority on NAFTA talks: Canadian foreign minister postpones UN speech
The Mexican government wants clarity on NAFTA: they're giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech at the United Nations.
The time pressure for a reformulation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico has forced Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland to postpone her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, they're focusing on renegotiating NAFTA.
Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators from Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
The US and Mexico had agreed in August to a revision of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted that Canada may be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
The talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
The agreement is now expected to be finalized by Sunday evening (local time), and the Trump administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of failure of the negotiations, Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous streets in Hanover.
The accident report of the Federal Statistical Office shows all the clashes of 2017 with injured and killed in Hannover.
The most dangerous intersection is therefore the Königsworther Platz.
City and ADFC want to use the data to make the streets safer.
Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was wounded in a knife attack, has been released from the hospital.
The extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in the open during a campaign event in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's organizations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In social networks, the associations also mobilized racist and misogynistic statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the million-dollar city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, but recently he has presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, a run-off election will be held on 28 October.
Observers believe that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this with success - no matter who he runs against.
Bolsonaro is known for his anti-gay and anti-black incitement and his glorification of the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks me with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe to win back Ryder Cup titles
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn's away team, in front of more than 150,000 spectators over the three days at Le Golf National, with great punches and outstanding team spirit, unseated the favourite defending champion USA by a toothless Tiger Woods.
Danish rock legend dies after a long illness
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsens website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band disbanded in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in everyone's heart".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at hammer-level
"Here we stand, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a re-description of the rock-and-roll live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Shoe Factory civic centre: pure hard rock by three bands who are friends.
After the soundcheck and just before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of the flu.
Afterwards, the rock stars from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly enthuse the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is already able to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the CD that will be released soon.
The band performs a dance in front of the stage to the harmonious and impressive interaction of the band.
Although "add" calls are not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative, sometimes classic rock sounds of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" by the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only is the longing, almost balladlike "Take Me Home" captivating by the shift from melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, gained a particular degree of fame since its foundation in 2005.
The band will be presenting their hard rock on Saturday with full agility.
That "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with their performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The sound is felt to be even louder than before, with guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivering an enthusiastic solo, walking through the audience.
A certain volume is of course required for such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the mixing panel team reported that the three-man concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is about the same as the pressure hammer, but still well below the "Wacken-Fesitval" distortions that "The Ignition" points to on their website.
The deafening 120 decibels of thunderstorms, as is the custom at the annual Metal-Stell-Dich in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not need at this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rockier gangart have already convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we are, taking the bone saw and lighting a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups may say, figuratively, at the end.
And most of all, enjoy the big applause from the visitors.
Red and White Cuxhaven win at Lamstedt
Football-like snacks, long periods of no tension, were offered to the spectators at Hertz's height at the game between TSV Lamstedt and Rot-Weiss Cuxhaven.

Penguins are fighting for the win against Mannheim
The Fischtown Penguins have celebrated a victory against the big favourite, Adler Mannheim, on the sixth day of play in the DEL after a great battle.

One person killed in a sailplane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
According to the West German newspaper, a sailplane crashed in the airport's fairground.
The pilot was killed.
The student pilot was reported to have been alone on board the plane, which was said to be a one-seat passenger.
The plane was already approaching the ground at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a few blocks from a tent on the airport grounds.
But this weekend, there's an Oktoberfest.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr-regional cities and directly adjacent to the motorway exit 52.
From the parking lot, there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump says to Kim, "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the president of the United States, is quite well-disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married president of the United States has pledged himself to a new flame.
The tragedy is, it's a long distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of his supporters in West Virginia, Trump has found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty of Pyongyang, even though he is proving to be a tough nut in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and we went back and forth", Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- What?
No, I really do.
And it wasn't just the conversation with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal relationship has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service behind it.
The US president seemed to be well aware that affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - not everyone should be aware of, because of his martial menacing gestures.
Anyway, he got the expected criticism of it right before he went on stage in a big gym in Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they're in love".
How awful, how awful is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he doesn't care much about that, Trump said, then pointed to the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be president".
But then we wouldn't be out there, pushing 10,000 people into this crowded arena, but we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
The Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is the best visited, atmospheric and, moreover, full of sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not held in the fire tower's tent, but was extended to the City by the trade union on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a video from their mobile phones to point out the dire conditions in which they are being held in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the video in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July, putting their lives at risk and sharing it online.
"They refuse to send us back", said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The video was sent to the website France 24 Observers, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria", Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
He put his life in danger with the video, according to his own testimony.
One of his comrades was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks".
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organizing the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent home this year through the program, said Jorge Galindo, IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerian man who was rescued is not unusual in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
He hasn't heard of a video call for help.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhuman.
The North African state, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
As a teacher went to the local public school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lesson for Monday, she was surprised by a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the lobby of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there up a flight of stairs to the ground floor or the front yard.
The teacher informed the police, who took over the investigation.
Whether property or money was stolen is not yet known.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man has spent several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central France after he had blocked the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue crews discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and are trying to rescue the man who has been missing since Tuesday evening, police said Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long period without supplies.
He said he was looking forward to home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after failing to return from a trip on Tuesday in his SUV through the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the agreement to the United States, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United Kingdom, and to the United States.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This is particularly true of the arrest waves, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important precondition for this".
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans imprisoned in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Mr President, I am sorry to say that I have not been able to attend the debate.
The meeting between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a Federal Ministry of Defence air-readiness building at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was to be held at the castle of Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused because of political convictions against Erdogan.
After the meeting, Erdogan continued his journey to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint performance at the construction site.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country".
We are also their contact person, not the Turkish president.
North Korea calls for disarmament: lack of trust in the US
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes of the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime presents the situation more soberly.
Secretary Ri is demanding Washington's approval.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent stall is because the US relies on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building", Ri said in New York.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the EU.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves", the North Korean chief diplomat explained.
He said that the idea that sanctions could "bring North Korea to its knees" was "a dream of people who don't know us".
However, to build trust, his country stopped nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test site, Ri pointed out.
The Minister criticized the fact that the US had not given "corresponding reactions".
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the UN Security Council last year alone imposed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been urging the United Nations to strictly enforce the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met for the first time with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors to the open-door house did not realize that they were actually at a youth meeting: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from various countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the youths wanted to thank them with food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the unpleasant surprise came: A power failure had disabled the huge two-part refrigerator, and the food had spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: we had a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it themselves", says Westbuer.
And so they all joined in.
The result was noticeable, and the guests were delighted.
"Cooks can't do better", said one visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to enjoy quiche, liver cheese, or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have done", said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed them with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of directors of NRW
Frustrated by criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become nationally known because the Essen board had introduced a ban on foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of NRW-Tabels in July, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
I've had too many of them.
The head of the NRW Tafeln Land Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy to dpa.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor with it.
"I can understand his step - people have expressed themselves who didn't know exactly why the Essen table does that".
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes", Weilerswist says.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" criticism of colleagues from other boards.
We must not go along with the "without us the people in the city will starve" approach.
It is the state's job to make sure that people don't starve.
The Essenese did not attend a conference of the tables in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm told too much sweet jam", he said.
There's all these social fuzzis who criticized me so much back then.
SF Lorch are playing 2-0 lead
Football, district league Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Hypocrites wins in Kirchheim after a loss - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
In contrast to the TV hypocrites: in Kirchheim, TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1 but won with 2:1 after 90 minutes.
Gladbach loses the lead twice - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose the lead twice.
Schalke wins their first win of the season (1:0) against Mainz.
(sda) Schalke has manoeuvred away from early opponents four times in the first five league games.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparation by Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, after which the hosts preserved the mini-pillar with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is once again at the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had been 0-2 down against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came back to win 4:2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65) and Marco Reus (69) equalised with a double in the fourth minute, while Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, scored another double in the final (86/94) to cap the performance after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
The Bremen team, which had been eliminated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, had to be scared in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler made a curious own goal, which helped the guests to the equaliser in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful debut, but neither did he experience a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Gladbacher, who started with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, took the lead twice, playing 2:2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW-Stadt since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from the 20 meter arch bridge, as well as in the second counter-attack after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite encouraging.
Alassane Pléa is proving himself as a goalkeeper in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record buy from OGC Nice was broken for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh qualifying match.
After seven laps, Gladbach is fourth.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen had manoeuvred against VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team: The 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey victory against Daniel Didavi yellow-red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game with a curious own goal (68). A quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 for themselves.
Half an hour later, Hanno Behrens had already put the home team on course with a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million people are voting today on whether to change the name of their country to North Macedonia.
A yes could resolve the conflict with neighbouring Greece that has been raging for almost three decades.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum was successful.
Syrian in captivity.
Fugitive attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners, some of whom were seriously injured.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the escape alley in Alsergrund on Friday around 10 p.m.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the defendant, who was clutching his fists and trying to attack passersby.
Then the Syrian tried to strike and kick the officials.
A short time later, it was discovered that the suspect had just hit three elderly women (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop in the Wallinger Straße.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured, "from an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and was under constant surveillance during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave each other their "yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told Bild newspaper that a registered partnership was not an option for them.
"If we get married, we'll be right". He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group on budgetary policy and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheim district, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir with a fury speech on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment", he said, referring to the accidental announcement by Günter Schabowski of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedges cut
There was a lot of work to be done by the members of the Children's Home and the Leper Society.
Because about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
The project was supported by the residents and involved about 12 supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs", explained Walter Schröer, chairman of the citizens' association.
And there's been a lot of that.
We're late this time because of the hot summer, but luckily it's just a form cut.
Because in the spring, the hedge was already shaved.
The tradition of breakfast after work is also long-standing.
"Everyone should be able to keep their strength", said Walter Schroer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold in the slalom
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the closing of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old set a perfect run on Sunday at the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the site and it all worked out today", said the London 2012 Olympic third.
He threw his paddle away in joy and raised both arms victoriously - knowing that it would be enough to win at least a medal.
At least he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters failed to top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second ahead of the Russian Pavel Eggel.
Police Inspectorate Gauting reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - and burglars are trying to take advantage of that.
So yesterday, Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first break-in attempt this fall.
The fact that it stayed on the one-family house on Königswieser Straße during the test is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on us just before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not home.
But the alarm apparently surprised them so much that they fled without any prey.
Information on the PI Gauting, telephone number 089) 8 93 13 30.
The reality of the day: Bayern against Ajax
The predicate is unassailable: the defeat in Berlin is "not to be let down" by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim finish for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance under the new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to rise to the greater autumn low for the Munichers.
"A week ago, it seemed that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us", Thomas Müller said after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those of you who know us know that this is really annoying and we are going to give Tuesday a go.
For the first time in more than a year, the away team has not scored a goal of its own, as at the same time the pre-season two consecutive games without a win, the leader in the football Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as it was at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its intense man-to-man tactic and the Berliners with their playful needle-stings over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overpowering Bayern are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let ourselves be fooled and we will do everything to be successful again", Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, he dealt with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only on the again poor handling of opportunities.
A win against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would, however, make the first interim conclusion of his term of office before the national break sound positive - otherwise the tone would probably intensify.
Kovac, for example, did not take any exceptional measures before his second first-class appearance of the season, after the 2-0 win over Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary match against Ajax, who had also defeated AEK Athens 3-0 in the opening game, will begin as planned.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we'll score again", announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As in the cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, which they lost at the same venue, Joshua Kimmich was the main speaker.
The lawyer acted as a reminder.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work on it again because we don't take the many chances and make the mistakes behind", the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh match day of the previous season, Bayern were even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich, with a wink, at least positively assessed that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good", said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish President, Erdogan, has made serious accusations against Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan, who were excluded from Germany.
President Grindel sees mistakes, but he defends the German federation's line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil on different stages.
After the Turkish president sharply criticized the way the former world champion was treated in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association's line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause at the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - that something like this will not happen again", said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had harshly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England", Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral.
To be honest, as your president, I couldn't stomach the fact that our two young men, who had made it to the German national team, were being excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonable treatment by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would be playing for the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm an immigrant - that can't be.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression", said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
He doesn't see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
The Commission is also proposing to appoint an additional integration officer, in addition to Cacau, a native of Brazil, and Celia Sasic, whose family roots are in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background makes a significant contribution to society and football and says 'this is an important issue, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration needs to work", Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup withdrawal and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office of DFB president next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can", Grindel said.
Junior makes three accidents in three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police reports, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Heights area.
The woman told the pensioner that he had hit her car.
But no personnel exchange took place, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had turned off the road and crashed into a traffic light.
When the man was called, he didn't want the police to come and then he drove off.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the retired man has been behaving badly in his home, where he has lived for decades, and has run into a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and arrest him.
His car had significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old man seemed confused and could not remember much.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: still almost 1000 emergency forces in operation.
Around four weeks after the Moor Fire broke out on a German army site in Emsland, 980 firefighters are still working on the fire.
The Federal Armed Forces announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to stabilise, a spokesman said, 70 volunteers were withdrawn.
The Commission is also proposing to reduce the number of staff.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster warning, which had been declared a week earlier on September 21, was canceled because of fears that the flames would endanger neighbouring forests and settlements due to wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was announced that the fire was no longer threatening to spread to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency personnel were on the scene trying to bring the large fire under control.
The German Air Force is continuing to support the work at the Meppen test site with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
On 2 and 5 October, the Bundeswehr said, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" were also planned.
The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke from the Moorish fire had been swept over a hundred kilometres of northwest Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hotel and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following:
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They've been together for 25 years.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave each other their "yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.

They had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
Referendum on the name of the new state begins in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
The neighbouring Greek province of the same name insists on it.
As a means of pressure, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also be launching the process of integration of their country into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the Holocaust from oblivion
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in 2016 in the United States, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be harvested with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register of organ donors this Monday.
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve stressful family members.
People who wish to donate their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained by Swiss transplantation if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be harvested only with explicit consent, as in Germany, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is estimated that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the time, a card is found at the crucial moment by potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"They then have to make decisions on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome", says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are plans to store information on possible organ donations on the health insurance card, says Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman for the Federal Health Information Centre.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation", she says.
The Federal Minister for Health, Jens Spahn, has spoken in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
His proposal would initially consider everyone to be an organ donor, unless he or his relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in calculus.
He won the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 other competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, where the competition was held, said on Sunday.
Sixteen-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany finished third.
The youngest participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired Frenchman, chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organises the competition every two years.
The previous tasks were, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, a show was held on Saturday afternoon, with participants competing against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how to hold a ball with his head in the air when doing calculations.
He's one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was already two years ago when he was 14 years old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy, Laue's organizers can't do much.
"Cerebral calculus can be trained", he said.
Many participants practiced for several hours a day.
In India and Singapore, even stadiums are used for computer competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the square root of a six-digit number.
In calculus, the candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The German referee said that the Germans would have a good chance here.
Otherwise, Asians often have the advantage because they learn calculus more intensively and with other effective methods from early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video of naked Serena Williams: It's about early detection of breast cancer
Tennis ace Serena Williams is showing off her sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to raise awareness about breast cancer and to promote early detection.
It's a matter of life and death, but it's also a matter of courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams is singing upstairs without the song "I Touch Myself" by The Divinyls - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
This emotional video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is about early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed blood clots in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week the Turquoise-Blue Coalition will send a draft law on the so-called "Symbols Law" for review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Cold polar air brings snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle will be shaking her beds for the first time in the West next week: polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Meteorological and Geodynamic Institute (ZAMG), the snowfall limit will drop to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohen Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow is expected above 2,000 meters.
The road conditions are therefore wintery on the higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) and the road is not very clear.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual nursery on Monday
The farmers of Schleswig-Holstein are allowed to start their annual nursery on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have marked the landscape of the forest-poor state for some 200 years.
The hedges, which are up to five meters wide, are a haven for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which organisms can still be exchanged, said Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were established by order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, but also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
The name "Knick" also comes from that time: by "re-knicking" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, the hedges extend some 45 000 kilometres between the North and Baltic Seas, giving the appearance of a wooded, diverse landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat for some 7000 species.
Up to 1,800 different species could live within a mile of the site and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it will shrink to a light tree line, which will not only lose its biodiversity but also its wind protection, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, nursery care is only allowed outside the breeding season from October to March.
After the Sulawesi tsunami, Indonesian speaks about the situation on the ground
In an interview with the RND, local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you in the area during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately headed back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, after a flight that required more than 20 hours of driving, since the Palu airport was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office is also destroyed, but we've set up a temporary place where we've also put other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have fled to surrounding hills, where they still endure fears of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water or food.
Some people are standing outside their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people steal some food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are free and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people still missing and not found.
How's the communication and information on the island?
We have cell phone reception at the moment, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know whether they live or where they are because people were not at home during the earthquake but on the road, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on that?
We don't know why, but when the warning came, a lot of people thought, "Okay, no tsunami", and then it did.
In other areas not affected by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was coming and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against VfB: Aogo and Donis must be waived for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be out of VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo suffered a muscle tear in his left thigh in the 2-1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga announced on Sunday.
Donis was diagnosed with a torn muscle bundle in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following international break.
The Commission notes that the Commission did not provide a forecast for the time of the outage.
A muscle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
The triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival is the annual closing ceremony of the most prestigious European film festivals.
Despite all the singing in the cinema, one thing can be said: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, with strong contributions from Europe and Asia in particular, and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, firefighters tried to catch a wounded duck.
The action, however, dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walking along the Olching Lake, on Sunday morning, a white, injured duck was spotted.
She was in the area of the water guard station.
To help the animal, passersby called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck failed.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency services.
She ended up running away to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the firefighters were able to circle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a hardened handle after almost an hour.
The duck was then taken to the LMU Veterinary Clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to preliminary estimates, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is aiming for a World Cup medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was in the stomach of biathlete Julian Eberhard.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The final shot cost the 31-year-old the near-miss medal at the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven tenths of a second to go for bronze.
"I deliberately took the time to process it", Eberhard says at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up on the lost precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the Constitution, to win something.
You've got to hit it sometime.
Eberhard's heart is already set on the track, he recalls with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
He was second in the team in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a brisk pace
Time is extremely limited and the number of scheduled interviews is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation in full swing, Republicans in the U.S. Senate are looking to secure a slim majority for controversial judge nominee Brett Kavanaugh on charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that date back more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding the culture war that followed Kavanaugh's impeachment was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer delivered furious tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was set to clear the way for the final confirmation of the archconservative U.S. Supreme Court justice.
The Republican majority seemed reassured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, despite his original announcement, declared that he would agree but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday's heavy-handed reprimands "shit", initially refrained from further attacks on women and spoke instead of "luck in misery".
He said that this would remove any doubt.
Later, at a rally, Trump lashed out at the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh, saying, "They're trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
The two women's well-known allegations will be investigated, and that is all, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on the Garden Street from Monday, October 1, according to the municipality.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory over Mainz: Fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
It was no different at home against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area", said the sporting director of Schalke 04 - and breathed in.
Finally, the Royal Blues had managed to bring the narrow 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first victory of the season under the table.
It could have been different.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11th the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given assurance Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing"., played obviously more and more the head a role with increasing playing time.
Don't actually create a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me", Heidel said. "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to let it go, so they kept retreating.
And with man and mouse against Mainz defended.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have a huge stone falling from our hearts", said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in the headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the squad".
But in the end, it's all about winning.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with a lot of pressure in the early stages and make a fireworks display out of it", said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
We can finally enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played smart, calm and brave, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Perhaps the biggest flaw of the afternoon was that the King's Blue failed to provide clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the lathe in '59/72 or Amine Harit in '62.
"Then it would not have been a victory", Tedesco said. "You'd have felt the fear a little bit".
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only one who was in trouble.
Fish Bachau: Smoke column in the Leitzacht valley visible 2 km
The smoke was unmistakable.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzacht valley observed a fire at about 1.30pm on Sunday.
The police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The police and firefighters soon found out the cause: an unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter plot of land near Gschwendner Berg.
Police said it appeared he had been watching the fire for a long time, but then left the flame unattended.
And that's near the woods.
Thirty fisherman firefighters were busy dismantling and extinguishing.
The police are investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at the level of the eye
In front of you is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my aim for many years to bring interesting people to Greven", explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani is very relaxed about the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gesture, solid numbers and a bit of humor, he brings the audience closer to one of the most contentious topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor in answering the question.
The German society is at one table, the first-generation immigrants are at the other.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to be part of the decision-making process.
This leads to conflict.
He stressed that the decisive question was not whether one was politically right or left, but whether he was "for or against an open society".
At first it is rather quiet, then the discussion gets more and more lively.
And there is a need for a speech.
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or failed integration in students.
El-Mafaalani is in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor doesn't impose his opinion, he emphasizes that he's talking about the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic because "first, when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions", says El-Mafaalani.
During the signing hour that followed, he also listened to the questions of the guests and discussed them intensively in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win the opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of play in the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
Gießen won in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonnese won the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
First-place finisher of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble at the start of the new season.
Munich struggled on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots of land
The demand is obviously huge: over 100 people have applied to buy one of the land plots in South Landsham.
The Municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land on the open market in the new development area of Landsham South.
This is Mayor Roland Frick.
The application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable terms or prices, similar to the previous local model, is also complete.
Frick said that about 100 applications had been received.
'The documents are currently being reviewed' in terms of the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have the list of candidates for the 20 plots drawn up by the end of the year and to submit it to the municipal council.
The award can be made afterwards.
In total, 50 single and double-family housing units and four multi-family housing units with a projected total of eight units will be created on the southern Landsham site.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
She sells most of it on the open market, 20 lots in the socially-consensual model.
The two multi-family houses in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing units subsidised by the Land.
200 people .
It is estimated that the new development area of Landsham South will provide roughly 200 dwellings.
Not only that, but now, in early October, Frick says, the start of construction of a new daycare is being made there.
It will house three kindergartens and three nurseries, as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo "great sport" succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row, he is not in the starting eleven: nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat on the bench for the third time in a row, not in the starting XI, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian had once properly talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1:0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, jumped in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was great sport", Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve presence, had no grudge.
Naldo, who was hailed as the best scorer last season, probably knows that he has not actually been put on the sidelines by his coach - but is being given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It was not easy to tell him, I can tell you that", Tedesco recalled the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting XI.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the cause, it's about the club", Tedesco explained.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a peek at the moment.
And that we keep everyone in the boat", Tedesco explained the rotation that last caught Naldo.
And the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austrian industry continued to accelerate in August in its downward trend compared with the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Austria still has the third-best mood across Europe, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50 mark for the 13th consecutive month, indicating growth.
Only Irish industry broke this threshold in August, at 50.9 points.
The Greeks came last (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, albeit at a slower rate than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley ride may mean that the worst is over", said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth driver, at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as sharply as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply than initially expected in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected a score of 47.8.
The Procurement Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
The data include trends in turnover, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchel's PSG team wins in eighth league game
This is the first time I've seen you.
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel is rushing Paris Saint-Germain from victory to victory in the French football championship.
At OGC Nice, the defending champion won with 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar and was successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon started the season this well was 82 years ago in France.
Brazil's Neymar took the lead after 22 minutes and set the score in the second half.
The interim score of 2:0 was scored by Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris also made it to the preliminary round for the Champions League group stage against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To start the season, Tuchel's team had to deal with the only mandatory game defeat of the season, with a 2:3 in Liverpool.
