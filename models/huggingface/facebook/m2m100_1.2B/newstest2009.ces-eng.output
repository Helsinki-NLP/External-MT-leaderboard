The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus at the end of trading.
Following a sharp downturn in the morning, the Prague stock exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares reached almost half of the normal day trading.
The Prague stock exchange continued to decline on Monday from the start of Tuesday’s trading, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the Wall Street stock fell.
The market reaction to the result of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector.
Stock markets in Asia
The stock markets in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although indexes eventually deleted some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng stock exchange index in Hong Kong dropped four percent during trading, but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the drop to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell by 3.6 percent, according to the Taiwan Index.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong’s Chief Monetary Officer Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it determines its monetary policy independently, meaning it is not dependent on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has the same interest rates as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should urgently return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries will feel the impact.
The Bloody Bath of American Shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was supposed to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly €12 trillion).
The lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath on Monday and major stock indices recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by seven percent and last recorded a similar decline in 1987.
The index dropped before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal did not pass in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress Resigns: U.S. Government Could Pump $700 Billion into Banks
U.S. Congress officials and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader deal on financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be held at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately SEK 12 trillion).
It has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan for supporting the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was stated by House Banking and Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan early on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that a bailout plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a “tremor” due to the complexity of mechanisms to help markets reach in practice.
The plan must be effective.
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences about what the package for market stabilization should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
The latter should buy off non-selling mortgage assets from financial companies, which pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
The recovery plan needs to continue, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has significantly impacted the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said lawmakers are trying to get a deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors against trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress’s decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is still unclear when both houses of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they can close the negotiations to some issue at the last minute.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated for the aid system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress, however, may block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program is not performing its function, following another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Obama appreciates progress in negotiations
The President can veto the decision, but Congress can veto it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to repurchase bad mortgage securities, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
“We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the mutual efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies.”
Reduction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibilities for the monetary program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing funding of the plan.
The new law also limits the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee that will oversee the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards a deal that will work and benefit the market and all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly costs of payments for debtors and allow them to retain their homes.
Labels: psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will share the losses,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so important, according to Mark.
“More importantly, this week congressmen have agreed that they are supporting this plan and that it will be adopted as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it will be approved is the most important at this time," Marek said.
Fight on the sharp knives: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy just a phone.
There are a lot of reasons to choose a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s hard to get a high-end high-end gramofon at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
However, such music products do not appear on LPs and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if there are vinyles with art rock, jazz or blues on your shelves, you probably dream of such a gramofon at least.
The same is true of music on the go, i.e. compressed music, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also quality and price categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand yuan for a player, just like a Pink Floyd fan will hardly get a headset for twenty yuan from the marketplace.
There are two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines battery duration.
Some top-of-the-art music players handle much more than just playing music, but what most mobile phones don’t happen to do.
No device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone and video, it can play music and video, both record, has a better, a worse camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And when we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can take pictures of anything.
The universality of the mobile also has its disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the display indicator will send you to the charger.
Playing music is one of the greatest sources of energy.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, in the case of cheap mobile phones, you will not be able to play for more than a few hours.
If you call here and there, buy one more charger to work for security – this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to a memory card, but only a few card readers can handle miniature memory cards that are used in mobile devices without reduction.
You do not need any special software for iPods.
All you need to do is fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already create a music library sorted by the name of the performer, the name of the album, the genre or the user rating.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories similar to Explorer in Windows, and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, operating system smartphones).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones are more capable
When choosing a particular device, pay attention especially to battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, control comfort.
If you listen to music every day for a short time in the tram, you will need any mobile phone that can play MP3.
This can be done by almost any mobile phone.
You don’t even have to watch what music formats your mobile phone or player can.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used, and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
You just need to visit the respective website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and purchase a song or album.
This service itself could already be a good argument for purchasing a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is mostly limited to fast-moving radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry a car with them.
Whenever you get a desire to listen to something, your cell phone is stuck in your pocket, while your MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always wear headphones or at least handheld handsfree.
If not, you can take advantage of the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of mobile music will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you can buy a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of output on the regular headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones with a 3.5mm headset can cost up to fifteen thousand.
The main advantage of these devices is, among other things, the ease of use.
The easiest – not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) – players can be controlled by really everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previously common cartridge or a gramofon is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of the accidentally turned on mobile internet and subsequently a giant account for data transmission.
Which device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach out to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than €1,100.
If you belong to the more demanding listeners reach for specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
The next is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as independent MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to £4,000, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours), you will get MP3 players from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing here – a virtual operator that would force the classic to downplay.
It may not be long missing.
The fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
It was also that the price of SMS is higher in the UK than in the rest of the world.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
Per this sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and a penetration of more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to cheer on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), has repeatedly stated that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network no longer has too many chances (otherwise, it would probably be hard to look for frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entrance of virtual operators to the mobile market that brought a significant price reduction, to which classical operators had to react.
Even before the entry into the market, such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We do not have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns, among others, U:fona.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not involve relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on an untouched target group can also be quite a good move.
This service is specifically aimed at men.
“The right guys choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept could be found in Poland as well.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings.”
Unfortunately, there is no chance, say mobile operators.
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations don’t look too hopeful.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region,” Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, told Mobil.cz.
It has been stated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything to prevent any potential competitors from emerging.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
We have discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already made progress in the negotiations,” said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Per it is glowing for better times.
The first virtual operator is expected to be available by the end of the year.
For now, however, his creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for the emergence of a full-fledged virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been contacted by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area,” Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telefónica O2 told Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also referring to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová added in rare agreement with O2: "So far we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
And he adds: “In the T-Mobile network, there will be hardly any virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table so that we can think about it in this short term."
Vodafone is focusing its attention on fulfilling the requirements of its 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “We are open to negotiating with potential virtual operators, especially in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial for customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with operators one hand
The movement of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to a fall in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
Why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when the operators are about something, they can pull for one rope, witnesses the hats around the formation of U:fona.
Per the biggest pressure toward the T-Mobile was at the time of the creation of T-Mobile’s U:Fona.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the website.
But now it’s just U:fon that’s a good reason not to allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that entering another player would put high demands on him and, above all, on his services.”
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, the total disinterest of Czech regulatory authorities is directly striking.
It is not just the position of the CSTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - has no powers to interfere in economic competition.
These are the responsibilities of the Competition Protection Authority (COPA).
He has taken a typical stance on the whole issue.
“The virtual operator’s entry into the mobile market would be possible after a contract was concluded between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of Foreign Relations of the ÚOHS.
The representatives of the operators are not surprised by this statement.
From the authority, which is to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market, this is more than a matter of consideration.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “In the overseas, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile phone services.”
Apparently, however, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the decline in prices does not belong to the interests of the UOHS.
In fact, shocking on the whole case is the touching sympathy of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is just a coincidence comes up on its own.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is only the work of chance and a tough competitive battle.
"The Office has not found signs of anti-competitive behavior in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore has no corresponding increased responsibility for their behavior on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are probably lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of relevant markets carried out by the ITU, according to which telecommunications are a single market from the point of view of competition.
Of course, none of these companies have a dominant position in the market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view – for the creation of a virtual operator, the consent of the network operator is always required.
And the mobile operator - it is quite logical - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, it must be dominant in a certain segment.
Even if we did not admit this argument, it should be at least warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are proceeding remarkably similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of stakeholders (including GTS Novera) show that when dealing with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
The weighting of responsibility to the CST is then a relatively usual trick in telecommunications, by which the CSTO takes his hand away from the whole matter.
We have met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted novel of the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of the CSTU to the field of competition in telecommunications did not succeed, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
They must know more than well, but their interests are elsewhere.
It happens when no one is watching.
At the same time, unnoticed remains the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, which in Czech mobile networks exists just a few.
They are companies issuing their own tariffs for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
This is usually done by multilevel marketing companies.
Its own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies usually come only to the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, you will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a violation of the terms and conditions we were dealing with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," said Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that such actions would not be carried out by responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands of customers.
However, none of the operators can prevent such a process.
These companies have insignificant profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a small percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not kept on their name, so they can’t dispose of it as regular customers of mobile operators.”
That should be at least strange.
Then another question opens up for the UFO.
If mobile operators are closing their eyes on a similar process, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the UOHS has relatively strong powers to reveal similar activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they have no idea of anything like that and their business conditions prohibit it.
When to be the most expensive
As has been repeated several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, traditional operators tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical – too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was in these moments that regulatory authorities intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and the creation of others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the uncertainty of competences is more than suitable for them in these cases.
Do not throw flint into the grain.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If any of the operators has admitted the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain reluctant to reject (discriminate) other interested parties.
And we may stop calling the drag than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where my home.
The hymn was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choir performance and instrumental version.
The song was sung by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the modifications of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He previously told Czech radio that he has deliberately selected singers with young representative voices that are expressive and popular for singing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care of both and then also the choir to have a clear diction, so that the text is well understood, so that they agree," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home first sounded in 1834 on the plates of the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka Josefa Kajetána Tyla supplemented by the music of Františka Škroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
After the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
The “New” Hymn
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time on chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will enter the history of the Prague Transport Enterprise as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and buses who will have an electronic voucher in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, there are approximately 100,000 people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and also let it be uploaded to their chip card in the information centers and workplaces of the Transport Enterprise at the metro stations Museum, Můstek, Holešovice Station, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can also be purchased via the Internet on the website of the Transportation Enterprise www.dpp.cz.
Over 400 customers have taken advantage of the service in the afternoon.
Those who begin to use the online store can definitely forget about the outlet windows in the metro stations, where they had to regularly stand in long rows for paper tickets.
The coupon is purchased via the Internet and uploaded to an Opencard card at one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"At these locations, passengers are provided with a checkpoint with trained service, which will help interested parties with online shopping and also upload the purchased voucher to their card," said Martin Opatrny, a project spokesman.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to the Opencard in self-service machines, which are mounted in several metro halls.
How do these machines look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers and passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
Check the driver’s place automatically
Managing the machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
You just need to insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid voucher will be uploaded to it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its vicinity.
Thus, in the suburban trains and bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, which travel to the capital mainly inhabitants of the central Czech municipalities.
"In the trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, guides are equipped with card readers, using which they determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which sets up the schedule of Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built in the driver’s box.
Therefore, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the specified place on the side of the box.
This way, the driver will check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel by suburban buses and will not remember when the coupon expires can go back to the self-service machines, where the coupons are uploaded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the device display.
Sudets want U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Sudet Germans demanded that Shumava be incorporated into the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Czech Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
In 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans appealed to the President of the United States.
This follows, among other things, from the letter, which was preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Czech Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the US president not to allow the return of the "Shumavsky County" - seized by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter, signed with the words “People to whom the fate of Shumava lies on the heart.”
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia presumably gives the Sudet Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only of brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president ask that the Šumava take over a protectorate for present and eternal times.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter-million people, you would give this territory to a country foreign to us, which oppresses and rejects minorities and in no way contributes to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States allegedly doubts about the mindset of the Schumacher Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Schumacher County on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some memorials, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudet Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least know that it would be their removal from the republic, only a few of them allowed such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudets.
They were hoping to stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Českých Budějovic.
During the war he served as a Buddhist German in the Baltic Navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that when they returned home, they would be happy,” Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don’t think – you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
This is the most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This will be the result of an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
The office of the Minister Aleše Řebíčka promises from her to deter drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should prevent drivers from driving fast and drinking alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them to hang up before they leave.
It is aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
This is evidenced by the slogan of the entire campaign:
You don’t think – you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in large letters on the speech.
In the bloodshed there is the word “pay”.
This is to symbolize that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one’s own life.
The spots will be scared by the audience until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of victims of accidents are commonly seen.
This will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and beating on drivers
Drivers are charged with sugar and beetles.
Sugar for them is that if they go on red, for example, they will save time.
A beat is a threat of a fine or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Korán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
Therefore, there is a need for information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, psychologists say.
There are also signs that warn drivers of danger.
“If a static danger warning board is installed, it will probably soon fuse with the surroundings and drivers will not pay attention to it,” Korán said.
Olmert would return almost all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of practically all territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He made this in an interview with Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) because without it there will be no peace," he said.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, doesn’t want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city, in which several people were killed and dozens were wounded.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites", which lie inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he emphasized.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace deal with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
“I do not propose a peace with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to gain the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up their continued support to terrorism (the Shiite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al Qaeda and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," he said.
Questions after an accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
It is not allowed to travel in a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padova, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers can travel on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is contrary to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in which a 22-year-old steward died last week was probably caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash, or brake, even when the steward loads coffee or newspapers.
It is important to know if the bus is equipped with parking spaces.
If the bus is not homologated, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have parking spaces; which Aktuálně.cz confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
“We talked about this with the ministry and initially did not allow the movement of passengers.
They then withdrew it and we have reached the point that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving, if they have a seat," he said.
The Steward's Law
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term accompanying vehicles; it does not define its rights and duties,” said Hanzelka.
The director of the road traffic department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law treats the problem sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has permitted parking spaces in the homologation.
This is the end,” he says.
The buses are divided into city buses where there are parking spaces and a maximum speed limit, inter-city buses with parking spaces with a higher speed and long-distance buses without parking spaces with a maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in a plane, says expert
Besip expert on traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
“With a smooth ride, many dangers are not threatened, the situation can be compared to service in airplanes.
Even here it is not certain when turbulence will come and the flight may hit the head.”
“If the bus brakes, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Like a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations," he says and also thinks, from the point of view of the law, the problem is unresolved.
Janus is ready to cancel the service.
Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
They employ two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"Once I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers are available on board.
It would also save money,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
“We don’t have a steward, we’ve been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in some fatal accident," he said less than a year ago to Week.cz.
A terrible tragedy happened.
In the accident of a line connection to Naples, a young steward from Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably stepped out of the removable lane without using a guide and blocked the route of the bus.
The driver attempted to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but struck him with the right front.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Janchura refuses.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit as well.
Amendment of the law?
In Invisible
The move of stewards on board the bus could be clarified by the amendment of the law, on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
Buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of a mobile phone when driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would seriously endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, adding that the control of the safety of buses is within the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Frankfurt is Düsseldorf
Big words in the letter of the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
The merger of the units of this money institution in Düsseldorf with Frankfurt’s Deka-Bank will create the “central institution of the financial group of savings companies for trading in capital markets,” we read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
WestLB, according to the letter, will enter a “set of competencies” into this transaction ensuring long-term returns.
And in general, such a connection may be a decisive impetus for further associations in the land banking sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose announcement to the country government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been discussed for a long time, including on the Frankfurt side.
At the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of the six-month management results that he saw no sense in the merger of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which consists of one half of the Land Bank and the other half of the Savings Union, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be a transaction on the capital market or part of it.
However, the negotiations have only just begun, finance officials say.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, Deka-Bank was merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Bank Helaba.
At the end of the day, there was nothing.
Shortly after the plans for the merger were made public, the Hessen Land Government opposed Helaba’s participation.
The other two houses were not connected.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, speculation has repeatedly appeared about the connection of Deka-Bank with land banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, expressed negative opinions about speculations about joining his financial house with others.
However, independently from this, it seems to be growing the belief that the convergence of the different banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the Bavarian parliamentary elections, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be drawn together as the first.
This is not good news for Helga.
If the pressure to further mergers increases, it gradually loses possible partners for such a connection.
In the South, it would only play a second violin, even though it has faced the financial crisis so far significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The connection with WestLB was banned in early this year by the Union of Savings Banks Hessen-Thüringen, which holds an eighty-five percent stake in Helaba.
This would be the case with Nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how much the business models of the various institutions are aligned.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the country’s banks, the German Savings Union has not yet answered.
Everything could also end up dismantling WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the local board of directors, it is also stated that it is seeking a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the interconnection of individual components with Deka-Bank, time will show.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the “weekend with Italy”
This is the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the Kaiser’s five-liter bowl, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest show how deep tones his throat can make.
Elena plays Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses with the indication "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" will depart this evening at 23.45, expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, one bus is used exclusively by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, in the night they have already celebrated.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, it’s nothing for Italy.
To Marc, who wears a long coat with a coat of fur and glasses with wide silver rings, the three buses belong.
He has been participating in the Oktoberfest for five years, and this year he has been organizing three excursions.
In the evening there, during the day between the bars with beer, at 22.30 departing back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome drink with Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, health insurance, and a German-speaking guide – Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses depart at night, along the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, but not yet.
The bus is quiet and the passengers are asleep.
They are doing well, they will still need their strength.
It is built in Brixena and Holzkirchen, where there are a few other buses with an Italian registration mark on the 8th motorway just before Munich.
When Marc’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half seven in the morning, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has the final speech, explains the plan of the attack.
Put on a yellow hat.
On it is written "Oktoberfest" on the left of the swallow, next to the internet address of Marc's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run away!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Run!" Run and occupy seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to hinder, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, spread around the space!"
The price is 8 euros, 25 cents.
Do not forget about drinking.
“Tell the police that we behave well.
Once you leave your places, they’re gone!”
Thirdly, “Tonight, exactly at half eleven, be here again!”
And up to Wiesn, a room with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, cedars, and even on a ballot poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
The weekend with Italy is known as the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
Exact figures on the number of visitors are not available; it is said that fifty thousand of those who embark on a journey across the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy.
The Munich police ranks will be reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics, in which the Italians ahead of the British (about 60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Particularly popular among Italians is the Hofbräu tent.
Hypo Real Estate Loans
Last week, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
Well, this politician has used the word "relatively" and has also embroiled the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis development.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aforementioned loan aid would go up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay interest on the amount actually spent.
The money comes from both public and private banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa’s subsidiary.
This state financier, according to the newspaper report, refinanced the long-term projects he borrowed money for extremely short-term, which is now impossible because of the distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve decreased by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros and the share of equity fell slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Normal revenue and net revenue from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, revenue from increased receivables and certain securities as well as the removal of credit trading reserves fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursements for subsequent clearing costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Regulations and the intermediation of trade for the group companies, the 16% decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for business owners, which were then removed from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because classical government funding earned too little, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of private-public-partnership (PPP) projects and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write down something, and these depreciations will have a "principal material effect" on the calculation of the whole group's profits and losses, as some have let us hear indefinitely.
There will be no dividend.
In 2007, it was reduced by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since Depf’s acquisition.
Stronger than other institutions, it relies on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans virtually dried up, as banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – approximately €50 billion.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable period and the firm is protected “from the influence of the international money markets currently largely incapable of functioning”.
Other sources have been told that this money is guaranteed refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to take advantage of the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group in the market is now ensured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors expect.
But given the dynamics and insurmountability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan would not have to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, a preliminary bailout could not calm the passions.
The share price dropped by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bonds are well held.
While preferential debt practically did not move, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This applies primarily to bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and logically to bonds with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the repayment of securities within their maturity.
But there can also be something that almost no one is currently hoping for: the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, a probability bordering on certainty has now become merely a legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term creditors for a series of awkward nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors can use the margin at least to make a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate returns of subsequent years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and the Secret of the Bento Box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is scheduled to introduce herself on her first day at high school in Tachibana, the girls start to quarrel: that German is entirely “kawaii”!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows this word already from mang. In her new exchange residence blog, she talks about Japan.
First day in Japan.
Lord, I was nervous.
I was upset on the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I travel 40 minutes by train to the center of Tachibana.
I had to find myself, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban is not given as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after 8 a.m. and twenty minutes before 9 a.m. starts a short sitting with the teacher, the so-called home room.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have school uniform yet, I wore my host mom’s old dress, plus a blouse, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So I stood before the bench and tried to say everything right: 'Sajónara Wo še Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have my birthday in a week.
I was very pleased that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the classroom whispered, whispered and whispered, and I kept hearing the word “kawaii.”
I knew it from my mango.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly got to my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite widely, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was relatively quiet, but when the gong sounded, they literally struck me.
They spoke one over the other, chatting and asking me about the possible and the impossible – and it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone packed their bags.
My host mom also made me such a box for lunch - and that's something different from a boring German snack.
I had rice with herbs, small pairs, a salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some fish in a tofu paste.
I don’t know exactly what I’m eating in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
It is certain that everything is really good.
Well, maybe except for the salt loaded salmon, br!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl will give the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is artistically crafted, and hopes that the boy will get to know more about the break at a snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I will see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading manga for years.
In order to better understand these comics and their culture, I began to learn a little Japanese.
I knew that I would have to come here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
They are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals also have emotions.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same when they behave like us?
In the online magazine "Edge" for several years, contributions of renowned scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has yet to prove, when we cannot prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we begin to engage in a different kind and open up the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we enter into an incompatible terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, it will do the same as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
People behave in a similar way, which some scientists believe is a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal experience.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and execution or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that a person differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden by the linguistic essence of a person: since so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not matter on language, it would be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, no matter how constructed, would probably differ from most states of consciousness of our own.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out how the consciousness of other animals might look.
When, as something inner and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, it poses great problems to explore it.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easily accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, developed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I derive them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
Thus, what we refer to as “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) exploits the operating memory.
Seeing from this angle, feelings are closely associated with those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with the linguistic nature, there is a subtle graduation of perception, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to physical feelings, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Because this network hasn’t changed much over the course of human evolution, it could be able to participate in the feelings perceived by several animal species.
Theoretically, I cannot object to this, but I consider it unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans is probably felt by both organisms equally: but how can it be verified, Pankseep says, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The swallow is running away from danger—is he also afraid?
In my view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the coincidence of experience.
It’s true that a neural comparison pushes us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but donkeys have no brains.
Is the brain responsible for emotions?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
I really don’t know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on language), I would rather examine emotional behavior than emotional perception.
Anyway, in this case we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Like rats, I do not examine language and consciousness, nor do I examine feelings, for I do not know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than throw myself against a wall repeatedly.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Time of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations will soon be directed by the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the early fulfillment of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are puzzling.
The number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We cannot waste time anymore.
We need to work now as quickly as possible,” said the head of the Ukrainian Union Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA will keep us on track.”
An even more radical move was adopted in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN was removed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The meeting was held at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not end in preparation for the EURO 2012.”
Several teams from the first league were only last season due to manipulations condemned to a forced descent, eventually even the beginning of the league had to be quickly moved.
Dennis Quaid Returns Strike
She wanted to advertise a new film, spoke in an interview about private matters – and now she has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her former Denis Quaid as a marriage disruptor.
He is angry and strikes back.
A delayed war of roses for former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennise Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, these two Hollywood actors lead a rough dispute together - in front of the public.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for her marriage's collapse: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
The scale of the fraud was discovered only after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan’s PR work for her new film “The Women” – one that tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: “It’s crazy,” the fifty-four-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, “that Meg repeatedly chews the history of our relationship and adjusts it.”
In addition, it is “regretable” that she once again “publicly reminds her 16-year-old son Jack of the pain and radical changes that a divorce is for every child.”
While Ryan has lived alone since divorce, Quaid is married again and has recently become the father of twins.
He concludes his contemplation with the following words: “My life goes on anyway.
I feel lucky to have a wonderful family that is going well.”
Flight and hotel prices decline
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one recent study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel accommodations have fallen again – this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its reservations data from the first half of 2008 and, after the price rise in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising hotel prices, accommodation in many places has already dropped.
Between January and March, prices increased by an average of 6.9% in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
Between April and June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express believes that the weak rate of the dollar has caused “the declining appetite of American tourists to travel.”
The fall in hotel prices also affected financial centers more than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent and even recorded a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Economy-class passengers paid an average of 7.1 percent more for fuel-intensive long-haul flights, compared to 29.2 percent in 2007.
Between April and June, prices in the Economy Class dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes in knowledge were less pronounced in the Business and First Class.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
Between January and March, they grew by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic years, according to the study, prices have dropped even by half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the disruption of unprofitable lines by airlines and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to a single goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to build a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - Increase Failed Landing for Representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach took part in the game late and failed with a blown balloon on the stick.
His message was precisely formulated and sounded convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Much did not happen in the catacombs, the break between the half-times ended and most people were sitting in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for almost three decades and he is more respected than many other actors.
And so his request was heard in a responsible place.
Coach assistant Cornelius Jol came in and raised his thumb in a sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jola.
His order was probably the same: here with a second goal!
There was no implementation.
“We didn’t look at everything right here today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wished it more relaxed."
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petrić (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbachs could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said.
Hamburger SV will celebrate its 121th anniversary this Monday.
The audience celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and a live-update table on the video wall in which their team was listed as a premiere.
It would be a birthday without a big party.
“We know how to assess it,” Marcell Jansen said.
He thinks that the interim table result symbolizes the uncalculability of the league rather than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petriće and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but can not flash yet.
“We need more empathy and more dribling,” Jol said.
After the vote defeat
There is fear on Wall Street.
Early reports of the sinking of the bailout package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in a single day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The technological exchange Nasdaq was down more than seven percent at 1,458 points.
The worst was in the Dow at this time, American Express, which lost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
None of the titles were strengthened.
Goldman Sachs shares lost almost 10 percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgages.
However, the entire amount is not paid out at once, but in several stages.
In exchange, the state will receive stock options of financial companies, which could be repaid if the exchange rate develops favorably, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe fall sharply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubt.
The stock exchange of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate is downward, with the Dax index pulling with it.
The Dow Jones index is falling despite a planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank dropped the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The stock of the Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of its value despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000 point line and recorded 5,839 points with a minus 3.7 percent.
The stock markets all over the world fell to their knees.
In New York, the Wall Street trading day began with significant losses.
Investors are worried that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package may not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent, reaching 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, while the Senate is expected to vote on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges were only moving in one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, while the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1% to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and trading ended at 12.595.75.
In MDAx, they lost after the announcement of the increase in the share capital of Arcandor.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has signed up 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group has also announced that it will not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects flight of spacecraft
For years, scientists have been unable to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of the spacecraft during the so-called swing-by (gravity practice) manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be correct.
The Ulisse spacecraft has been flying in space for 18 years.
Due to the freezing of fuel lines, it is now threatened to die in the winter.
Among scientists for years one mysterious phenomenon is causing confusion - the anomaly of the gravitational strain.
A gravitational practice is an aerial manoeuvre by a spacecraft in which it gains an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a cosmic body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physics trick as well as the Solar Ulysses spacecraft.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is astonishing: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect according to the old good law of gravity.
There are irregularities in speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
To date, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
It is characterized by an anomaly of gravitational traction.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, might not be correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational strain using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.
“The dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It appears to be a gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, meaning it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
Scientists estimate that dark matter is about one-fifth of the mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists released in Egypt
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Egyptian foreign minister said the tourists who were abducted in Egypt were released again.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six of the abductors were killed.
Five Germans were abducted in Egypt.
The redemption negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the abductors.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists travelling to the Sahara are free.
This was by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to Italian TV channel Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are just checking their health,” Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the abduction before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the cited worker.
He said it was "only about taking hostages," when suddenly this "surprise" came.
Sudanese troops on Sunday shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom, citing one of the German mediators, said that the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the hijackers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the hijackers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Father abuse “led to suicide”
Several years of abuse by the father led the woman to commit suicide, the court heard.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied his daughter-in-law Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court also said that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound her and tied her eyes and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
However, before the court hearing, Mrs. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was pursued by a ghost of abuse committed on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006 friends of Miss Randle, who was also very devoted to surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
He is believed to have drowned in an igelit bag.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter's father-in-law, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and bound her eyes.
“I did not abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, “You’re an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the case would probably not have come to court at all."
“I would like to highlight the consequences, according to Stephani’s parents, your crime on their daughter over the years,” he added.
"Of course, she would otherwise probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials who lost data will be charged
The BBC learned that a government official who left strictly classified documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two strictly classified documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents went to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the least serious offence against the aforementioned law and nothing indicates a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many at Whitehall.
“They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the government office,” he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause dealing with information protection.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained covert analyses of al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Companies facing debt B&B
British co-operatives may have to deal with more than £80 million in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Association of Cooperative Deposits (BSA), said it is “concernful” that the backups and their members have to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be paid off by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that is being paid in the meantime will be paid back annually by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Compensation Plan for Money Services for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 co-operative advances are included in this number.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which acted discreetly... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions, which were far from so discreet.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the depository should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that backups will have to find £81 million to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the trade association of co-operatives, told the BBC he is convinced that this is not fair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that acted prudently during the boom of the housing market, now have to pay off some of the bills of those institutions that were far from so prudent.”
According to the BSA, no backup has fallen since 1945.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this in the coming weeks to see what options are available to protect co-operative backups and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole said.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since co-operatives are shareholders-free organizations, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs 5 cents per liter.
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per liter from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence price hike in February, and comes after research conducted by a consultancy company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect price increases in customer prices.
Before the February rise, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Deposit for Bangladesh Prime Minister Rejected
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vadid to be released on bail, meaning that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court had refused to release her on bail on charges that she had obtained more than fifty million tokens ($729 700) from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges against him.
Khalida Zijá, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on her honorary word to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is not clear under the conditions of her release whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal against the Supreme Court’s order to the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request for bail, saying she doesn’t need a bail when she’s already undergoing an investigation abroad, released for an honorary declaration,” Rafique-ul Huq, her lawyer, said in a statement.
“We will appeal against the Supreme Court’s decision.”
Her lawyers said she needed a bail in order to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
The high-ranking official of the People’s League said that Sheikh Hasina should return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheik Hasina and Khalida Zijá both deny all charges against each other.
Vaccination against polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, 200,000 children did not participate in the recent widespread polio vaccination due to violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations carried out vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it did so despite taliban promises that it would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB loses trial over ITV
BSkyB has lost a litigation over the review of the Competition Commission’s decision ordering the company to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission had previously stated that the share of BSkyB had undermined competition and given the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB acquired a stake in the store in 2006, which consequently prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office for Fair Trade announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin Consortium CEO Sir Richard Branson, consumer organizations and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution – primarily because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair drafted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmaker and former Justice Minister Albert González.
The investigation was sparked by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to defraud justice.
Inspector-General Glenn Fine said in the report, “Serious allegations including potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. lawyers from their duties in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers were fired due to poor performance.
However, later it turned out that the dismissal lawyers were not rated worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers have been involved in prosecuting senior Republican lawmakers and senators, while others have refused to investigate allegations of voter deception raised against the Democrats.
U.S. lawyers investigate and prosecute lawsuits for the government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Ministry, Minister Alberto Gonzales, resigned after being fired.
Several other officials in the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The inspector-general’s report was very critical of Gonzalez’s role in the affair, saying that he was “mainly responsible” for the dismissal, that he had “abdicated” from his leadership position, and that he had “no remarkable involvement” in the case.
Other officials, including former Bush senior adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf receives one of the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend a ceremony in London next weekend for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" with the recognition he received.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year, Coldplay have been nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted about two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and reached fifth place.
But Meat Loaf’s album, Bat Out Of Hell, held the chart for around nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was operated for an irregular heart rate after collapsing on the stage.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his voices.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, motorways and other highways, some famous, others merely commercial.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding an Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This little street is in the East Village neighborhood and leads north from First Street – without getting to Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it more resembles a dusty passage than a traffic movement.
There are no signs of street names.
In an atlas, it is practically invisible.
But it still has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer of newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to rebuild and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-standing neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened street just because it was one of the last remains from the time the block was nobilized.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of Construction, which has the street in its power, has no interest in adhering to it.
At a meeting of the municipality’s land committee, representatives of the city administration and the Avalon Bay company outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Municipality 3, the committee favors a variant where the street remains in the hands of the city, and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
“The city already owns very few land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession,” she said.
"Proposals could be submitted for repair and management, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to rebuild the small street and set up seating spaces, some of which would be used by a cafe, whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy a street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn’t necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate sidewalk and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for Conservation of Construction, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the task of his office was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door to Extra Place led to the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the sidewalk is best known as the background photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
“The place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
“It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.”
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the refinement of the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and argue that that piece of public property, though modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity – a unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: a bitterly nostalgic view of a city in the process of extinction"), hanged out part of the story of Extra Place from the Talk about the City section, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark even in the daytime, and bordered by the scratched iron gates of warehouses and shrouded windows, where week-old newspapers are wrapped in the roofs.”
With a few exceptions, one last night’s street looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today stands a costly clothing store.
There were graffiti on the walls, and beside a fresh batch of throwed newspapers lay an empty bottle of beer.
A couple of passers said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that some boost might be useful.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thinks some people underestimate the impressiveness of the sidewalk in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been in places dark, moist and disgusting."
Bilinguality Debate: Immersion in English
In this edition of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidate attitudes to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Where is Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.”
To effectively reach the Spanish voters is a cumbersome matter.
Barack Obama’s educational agenda only proves this.
Obama’s campaign notes that “Afro-American and Hispanic students are substantially less likely to study than white students,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance disparities, Obama’s educational agenda promotes, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in classrooms, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance gaps.
Take for example Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the Los Angeles East district.
Most of the students are from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are just learning English.
Nevertheless, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008, 100 percent of fourth-grade students reached the highest level.
Nearly equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade students reached the highest level in the state tests in English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and an approach without excuses.
Further, and that Obama should notice, according to Lindy Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach to those who are just learning English is “complete immersion.”
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, “We had a tremendous success with one entirely new student from Mexico – after twelve months you would enter the classroom and not know who it is.”
“It works,” she said, “for us it works.”
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for how other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-learning students should look?
The results the school achieves should make the answer to this question obvious, but its own party’s educational agenda (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make Obama’s prediction of the answer clearer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, “you should make sure your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about educational models that work, rather than mocking them and trivializing them.
Oil prices decline due to recurring economic worries
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. plan to save the financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
Oil prices fell by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month, jumping out on a wave of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety raised investors again on Monday, even after Congress announced that it had reached an agreement over the biggest bailout plan in history over the weekend.
This report was overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive breakdown, the government announced that the Citigroup group would acquire a banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the furious weekend negotiations that led to the plan to rescue the economy "revealed as unable to revive the market mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for markets with global stocks, interest rates and exchange rates has strongly worsened,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the infection.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is to what extent the American virus will spread throughout the world and especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts lowered their forecasts for next year as oil consumption declined due to slower economic growth, and lowered their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20 percent.
Driving in the second quarter beat the team’s record
After spending more time with the Jets over the past eight seasons than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a spanked ride.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the dark clouds above each other with their troubled game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles to a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly predicting the afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter behind two other touchdowns, including one in which he fell the cornerback, and another 10 seconds before half-match.
“It wasn’t anything extraordinary,” Favre told Coles about all his recordings.
“He’s a fucking good player.
We communicated very well, no matter what people thought.”
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
The Cornerback Darelle Revis captured the missing throw and returned it by 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another recording and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens drove Warner to the pitch.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was the best ever.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a twenty-yard goal from the field, winning lead 34-0.
That’s the most Jets have ever earned in a quarter.
Jets Coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe this madness, said, “The second quarter, or the third quarter?”
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without a response - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I the second quarter much more than the third.
A lot of things have been done in a short period of time.”
The resting Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record on Sunday at the Berlin Marathon and became the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 he overturned his previous time at 2:04:26 in Berlin last year by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is indeed incredibly broad – breaking a world record or at least being a world champion on all distances from a metric mile to a marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing because he feared — from a retrospect too scary — that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
He promised to go to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions – sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish – Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have focused on on longer runs has dropped the marathon record in the past decade by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters he had cramps in his thigh two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break seemed to be more of an excitement than a delay.
“I’m so happy,” Gebreselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a bit in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized – mainly in Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia – for supposedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon tops, relying on drivers as if it were a race on the track, and building world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached halftime at 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped, Gebreselassie was constantly pursued by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie, he last picked up and ran away from Kwambai, who then reached second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, the excellent year ended with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 by Irina Mikitenko, a Kazakh compatriot who is now a German citizen.
The record time at 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff from the UK.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won last spring in the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes in the third marathon she ever ran.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runner-ups run into a big advance and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of black people living in a separate city
Hidden among the rugged amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and enormous, lies a quiet city where the pride and demands of African-American life come to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: “a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of quaiwa, two schools, and no prison.”
Now it is a wanderplace.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee come to the annual eatonville festival Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a side, even though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It’s still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what he’s losing.”
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of races, many residents remain cautious of foreign views.
“We pay great attention to how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
“It must be right.”
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historic model of black rise and a community of 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of Southern rural Negro culture – sometimes despised, sometimes praised – which emerged from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the worries about Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through hearty books full of inscriptions such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of a Florida tour guide have transformed the city into a little bit of Road 17, which leads through the often overlooked center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With a big bubble in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Left next to the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he doesn't know much about reading or writing."
She also mentioned Widow Dash’s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of all kinds and anything at all that fits into an hourly hotel.”
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, re-marriage, and sex.
This was obviously not a typical Fodor’s publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's choir girls that Hurston made immortal by quoting men who sang silly songs about their beauty.
“Some people don’t like it,” she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipster who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore trousers in a city that is still proud of being worthy of dressing.
Most of the inhabitants were fascinated, Franklin said, but many flattered.
“The people of Dawn have always liked to see it,” Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, “she never stayed too long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were discarded from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville and the rest of the world had forgotten about it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
“I think they didn’t understand its significance to the world or its message at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 1980s.
Officials in Orange County wanted to stretch the city through a five-way highway instead of the Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
Orlando climbing has already pushed Interstate Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for mixing races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on the people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
“There was a woman who was killed.
They threw melons out of the car.
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court’s demand for forced integration and stated that its decision in Brown v. the Chamber of Education was “insulting rather than glorifying to my race.”
Residents now argue that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has diminished cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of youth.
“Black children were used to hugging – I remember it – you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
“You don’t embrace your white teacher because your white teacher – I mean there’s a cultural barrier there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create room for many other Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors, and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with careless self-esteem and quotes such as “How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I will not understand.”
In 1975, Alice Walker went to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, the acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway came to the shelves of the bookstores, re-incorporating her into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramp again.
Former neighbors of Hurston now regarded her as a savior.
To show what could happen to destroy their highway, the community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many come back to celebrate.
After a few years, the state has withdrawn from the highway project.
“The five streams of the highway have resurrected, you would say directly blown up, a real civil pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply: “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Outside towns like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a fading street in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today it is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated cautiously.
Permission for most interviews is required to have in advance, and certain things — such as wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church, painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher who loves the full red, are still worried that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as Hurston’s festival grew, domestic pride also grew.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled and so, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, laborious, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicity.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, a sincere love for the village sounds when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police he says would enjoy some help.
And even the younger, like the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, just going through here, will think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment into history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently financially
At first sight nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stations and the huge TV screens on Times Square, they’t realize they were standing in the midst of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glazed beekeeping of the offices above their heads, bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York every day have the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rattling metal trucks on the sidewalks and carrying muffins for breakfast meetings.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street dining stalls, and it’s still not possible to get a yellow taxi on a business day between four and seven in the afternoon.
It didn’t look like a crisis at all until I, with all the talk of pessimism, decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to cover up with the late afternoon siesta at my local J.P. Morgan Chase branch, there were about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of the box office to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the compartment where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for a trip to Macy’s mixed goods store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my “licensed personal banker,” came for the same reason as me.
However, compared to me, they have already taken their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They took money from so-called thrifts (a little like building savings), money associations, and those types of savings companies whose branches operate only in one state, and which claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks quietly went bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers returned home for a weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Office and store employees who stood in front of me and feared another collapse moved their cash to the bank, which is perceived as a safe haven and which is doing most of the rescue on Wall Street.
New Yorkers have learned very well over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone and talking to Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and its exiled chief executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity as if she was talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed fifty-year-old housewife of my classmate, changed the topic of our usual conversation—Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, “I now have my savings in money market funds.
I’ve moved it, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim tombs defiled after right-wing breakup in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Free Party, and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party participate in a demonstration that presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that depict mosques crossed by a red line.
Police accuse far-right extremists of defamating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in general elections.
More than 90 graves at the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were sometimes severely destroyed between Friday evening and this morning and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some of the tombs, such as the David Star, but detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask extremist motifs led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation that comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan approaches its end.
In the meantime, Austria is entering a cycle of searching for its own soul after the right-wing collapse in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which combined more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, which received over 18 percent of the vote, protested against shirt and burqa in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political block in the country, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to go abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who has been convicted of sexual abuse of children, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he planned to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent Police passed the travel ban last Thursday after it handed over to officials evidence of Glitter’s past convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, whose real name was Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the judicial service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford’s Lower Criminal Court, Kent Police requested an order to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present.
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as it stores a record in the register of sexual assailants.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also submit the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he fails to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter’s possible routes through the district.
A Kent police spokeswoman said: “The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our perspective, it’s easier to keep an eye on someone staying in the UK because we have extensive systems here that deal with potential hazards more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for Kent police and we are working hard to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual assailants to minimize any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities prevented him from passing through passport checks and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Lowest Criminal Court in West London, while Scotland Yard successfully requested an order for him to register as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the interior ministry said Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off the stage." - Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no calls or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, disconnected from the focus on interpretation, will a relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
The second is man.
Indissoluble, apart from privacy, in those moments far from the audience – then one can see an intimate gesture, the depth of a letmo captured look, or the passionate gesture of hands that are careless because they are not going to perform on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less-known faces of masters.
With this intention, the photographer builds a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Month of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), “reflects the ever-growing international importance of Flamenco,” says the author, explaining that “Flamenco-people” “can be any people, but when you look at the photos, you’ll find that they’re not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed “on the street” are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy... and entirely captivating the audience to the stage.
To capture the personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the big flamenco.
Fascinated by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic foundation of the picture and lends it the contemporary spirit, an idea which according to Bauer himself reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What strikes the audience is not the action of the dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perceiving, being and experiencing, this was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of 70 photographed artists is shaped by famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology and soon comes a book edition that will contain portraits on display.
A passion for portrait painting led Bauer to the idea two years ago to repeat the idea on the "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from the "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them, and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think in photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
One meets or encounters people, personalities that sometimes they don’t even know, or give him a few minutes to photograph.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery on Rua de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the novel he writes is "trouble"
Set in an environment he does not yet know, and tells about events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project - is currently working on a novel, the main character of which is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and also travelled in the Amazon.
The perpetual favourite of the Nobel Prize for literature admitted at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is now employing him is "a trouble" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I't do it, but I'll do it and I believe I'll finish it one day," he concluded his contribution at a festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which in four days saw around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Prize for Favorite Writer – Dickens’ old edition of “Our Mutual Friend” – filled the theatre of Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Felix Rome, who cited him, he had a dedicated audience before him, to whom an hour of time ran like water – a Peruvian with amazing precision and a noteworthy dose of humor remembered how from the original “incredible adventure” of “the pleasure of a passionate reader” and of “the power to live more than I lived” he had born a literary mission; how he suppressed “the lack of inspiration” by writing “disciplinary”, carefully stacking the text, correcting and rewriting; or how his writing influenced Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what “memorial paintings” are the supporting basis of his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that “there is no way” to find out whether and to what extent books can change lives, “but I refuse to believe that literature is merely fun, a flight experience” – stressed Vargas Llosa, saying that according to him “it acts on people” and “it forces them to try to get out of line”, and urged the writers to “not be subject to frivolity” and “take responsibility” for their mission.
Because of the climate, the festival in Pozoblanc is missing - there are shortages
The performance with copies, which closes the ceremony in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after confirmation of the announcement by the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
This is why the company, along with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez, decided to cancel the bull games.
Unfavorable weather conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second planned match.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to face the bulls in the arena on Castilblanco.
It was celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was awarded on his shoulder as a reward for a dynamic and aesthetically quality performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two shots with a spade for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him rather by the uncovered seats in the arena than by the art of the toreador.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bull arena of Los Llanos unsalted non-fat.
In the second round of hard work without a single breath, he received sharp criticism from the majority of the audience.
Police captured a truck with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
Five in ten minutes.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
Officers stop two people in the truck and they run away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report from the Interior Committee of the Basque government, officials pursued them and arrested one of the persons in the truck, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A.A.J.
He was charged with drug smuggling and counterfeiting state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on the N-1 in places where it crossed the border of the urban district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop the truck in order to check, but the driver did not obey the instructions, sharply accelerated and ran away.
Officers immediately began to pursue the car, until the vehicle stopped at the end of the road several kilometers away, at that moment both passengers jumped out and fled into the forested porch.
Ertzaintza officers finally caught one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects carried, as revealed during an inspection of the Iveco Daily truck.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with packs of hashish, which were subsequently taken to other police departments for detailed examination and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the registration mark was "pressed" and did not agree with the data in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also accused of falsification of state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detained A.A.J., 28, was taken to the police department to complete the appropriate formalities before further investigation would be undertaken.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the favourite Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual manoeuvres while trying to get out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Road Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that around 16:30 a.m. Locklear “stumbled sharply on the gas, drove back and forth in a noisy burst, and tried to get out of the parking lot – she swallowed her sunglasses several times when she walked.”
A witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on a nearby highway and stepping out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the emergency service because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, she found the actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
"She looked disorientated," so the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were soon ruled out, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was noticeable to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of a closer unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The head of the IU and United Left MP Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of the former council department of Youth and Sports of the Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of acting in favour of his family, will depend on the party’s regional association.
"I am too federalist for it, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested the negotiations to which the party will have to step in relation to the former member of the Seville city council.
The head of the IU, however, insisted that "transparency" is absolutely necessary in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct that Silva has committed: "The IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has "a strict ethical code for all public functions".
"April's Blood" (The Blood of May), an epic bet by Garci
José Luis Garci, in the film Sangre de mayo, inspired by the national past episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French – the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to “describe the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society” which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría, during the presentation of the film before a large team of performers.
May’s Blood with a two-and-a-half-hour metric will be released in cinemas this Friday, and a more than four-hour TV series for Telemadrid is set for the future.
As a great admirer of the literary creation of Galdóse, José Luis Garci claims that he has fulfilled a “children’s dream” by making this film, thanks to Esperanze Aguirre, who three years ago in the Autonomous Province of Madrid commissioned him to shoot a film on the 200th anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer with the fact that the plot would be based on Epizodes de pasado nacional.
The $15 million budget, which was fully contributed by the province of Madrid, represents a “unique opportunity” for Garci to create an environment with scenery and costumes corresponding to the image of “a shivering Spain that mistakenly became a leader for whom it was possible to fight – the struggle for independence led under Ferdinand VII to the decline and backwardness of the country,” he said.
But the director regrets that he can’t count on the financial support that got to the films “Ala triste” or “Goy’s ghosts” – almost twice as much as “May Blood” – so he couldn’t shoot some scenes from a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he worked almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Begin Again" (Volver a empezar) works as he is normally used to - on stage along with the actors he usually tries with before shooting and who he does not choose casting, because he feels "humiliating" and also believes that "the part of the director's profession is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and so find out what is happening in the craft he is engaged in".
Many of the actors he has chosen for May’s Blood have appeared before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscars nominations, one of which he has won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year in front of the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Biliard and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represent the younger generation of the Spanish film scene, but claim that “it’s just about to appear.”
Garcia does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for what’s going to happen next, but then you realize you’re only working for a profit, so you’re going to make one more movie,” Garci said in a statement.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
Seville flamenca dancer will pay tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, father of a Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of an Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and when she was three years old, she moved with her family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion and was a pioneer of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was fascinated by Isabelle Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she designed this character for me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, but about grabbing the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So “the butterfly dance” evoked me a guajira or “the serpent dance” some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic," she says.
The performance includes the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Povedo, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in La puerta abierta, and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made the exception and joined her former pupil.
Matilde represents the elderly Tórtola, a mature figure.
I’m happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it’s a great honor for me.”
In the performance, he also counts with the music and guitars of Jesú Torrese and Paca Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artists who are primadons with everything and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place in her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some time, but nowadays nobody knows her and even less appreciates her creation," Bayon says.
The show begins at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "The Newly Married Man's Diary" closes the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The Newly Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The “Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón” is coming to an end with the new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the itinerary exhibition “Juan Ramón Jiménez: One Sunshine”, which opened in May this year, and after going around various Andalusian provinces, it is scheduled to move to New York at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government has also ordered eight hundred copies of the “Diary of a Newly Married” edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the world’s most famous Andalusian poets.
I don’t like Paul Newman anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intentions" and under the burden of knowing that Newman has left, reveals her reluctant vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
See how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He knew he was seriously ill.
He was a guy for everybody.
“Sometimes what a man feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford in tears, “my life and my country have been better thanks to him.”
No one is afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and homeland died in a dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when they are desperately looking for reasons to be proud.
When the times are harsh and people without virtues and just a handful of those who are worthy of admiration – you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from a drug addiction foundation founded in honour of his firstborn son who died from overdose, to his own brand of home food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has made a lot of effort to get rid of its suicidal food culture.
A stormy wave of admiration has flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
“That fox has given us all a pretty high lap,” says George Clooney, one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman, based on honesty and leading a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy, sometimes not even possible, in today’s media jungle.
But fortunately, such people are and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, though he had more than enough opportunities not to be.
“Why should I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?” he joked.
Let him be accompanied in heaven by the pride that there is harmony between his daughters and admirers on earth—it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a dedicated philanthropist."
The Olympic Games of Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the unsuccessful 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow the race of yesterday, I say no!
It was spoken of as a perfect race, and in my judgment it was the worst I’ve ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that if there was an assessment and I was an examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
Let’s look at it from the beginning, one by one.
The nonsense begins with picking up a racing number, for which one has to leave earlier.
It doesn’t seem bad to me, but when you’re going there, let them give you everything (including a chip to avoid overcrowding the track).
But not .
Here one had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there just because of that) and (after standing in the proper row) - what a surprise! - they only had a shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
That because of the crisis decided to buy only small shirts, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Well, that’s a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that he had to go very early for the chip and the front to it took over 15 minutes, he had to hand over the backpack there.
It took over 35 minutes to wait, which is something incomprehensible at the race, where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks off yet, and when we’ve done it, with picking it up it was much worse.
Additionally, the wait was extended by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not see the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record me the correct start time.
Of course, if anyone asked me about a perfect race, I’t think of this one.
So I think we’ll have to just dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a reception (virtual)
At the MIT New Technology Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new system of image recognition and human interaction on the way of artificial intelligence – not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the company’s campus) and perceiving what it hears in a conversation.
With a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this “receptor” can see how many people are in the room who they are – even remember what they’re wearing – and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
They can also classify the participants according to conversational groups.
On a demonstration video, the receptionist captures a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group speaking to her, and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is going to someone, and tells her that he will take care of her in a moment.
Without the blue screen of death.
Fantastically .
This is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had only the most necessary things, without the burden of commercial unnecessities, they would be five times more powerful - humans, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discovery as a thunder when we consider that Microsoft version by version adds new features and other “extra” to Windows.
Change of direction would be an act of merit.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing importance, and the software is similar.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned to the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your man when you have to say something to your maid.
That is true.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more attention to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer — or Chrome — and every day we spend more time on the internet than around the windows.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here is a small example.
I took this photo in a restroom for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
On the drinking machine there was a poster asking them to use their search engines: "Your search.
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the Internet.
Last week, the latest version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count until 2010.
Microsoft will try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay a lot for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shining in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Motor", and in addition it is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the list of his life roles, we can immerse ourselves in the image of a typical muscular with a spicy beard that raises the heads in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it is nothing more than a typical cotton men’s underwear, adjacent and without sleeves.
English speakers call it ‘tank’, but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
Firstly because of its cradle name – although it is popularly called ‘Marcel’ – which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the rest of the quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost undetectable) Belgian flag, which models of the most emblematic tile have as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company is not specialized only in tank tops.
It also produces college pants, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton trousers, navy shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Designed for comfortable underwear.
It is a pity that they are just underwear.
They are too beautiful.
“I want to be a young mother, who will be a father doesn’t bother me.”
The great likeness with her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small in character, is a woman full of life.
The Cruze Sisters are now taking their new role in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, this means much more than just having some pretty, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in a promotional event held in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the less significant fashion awards sponsored by this Spanish company.
She is hearty and bold and will get you close.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to introduce the new collection that we and sister Penélope designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
It was a tough but at the same time exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the 50s and 60s and we’ve drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also like to wander around the city and observe women walking dressed, combining and layering their clothes, I do this very often.
You are a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but after all, everything is interconnected and has many connections.
I liked my clothes, I always wanted to go to my grandmother, talk in my aunt’s closet and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You know, however, that we dancers base ourselves on how we are adapted to feel good in our classes and exams when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really penetrate the character.
So everything is interconnected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
Are you 30 years old and have you had a crisis?
where though.
I feel better than ever, I’m 30 years old.
I find that a woman is already done, she has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother, right?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don’t want to miss it.
As for my father, I’m not worried about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As far as the film is concerned, there are several premiere films you made last year.
I’m looking forward to it and I’m looking forward to it coming to the cinema.
I come from the theatre world, so I’m very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and so of course it’s not possible.
I’m looking forward to the premiere of “La última hora” and “En busca de la tumba de Cristo”.
As you will like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the show mole alongside Naomi Campbell, right?
No, do not say it.
It’s not like I’m going to be on the bridge as a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, called me and invited me to London to attend a charity show for her organization “Women for a Better Life,” and the clothes we showed – I also selected two models from our Mango collection – were auctioned and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don’t know that Naomi has such a good heart.
Many things are said about it, and since I know it, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
In addition, I will stick to the good in which he is engaged.
She asked me to perform for charity but when she asked me to make a stand, I would do it too.
I will do what is necessary for the women of the Third World.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install a "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in their vehicle that prevents them from starting the car when they are drunk or if they do not breathe.
The proposal came to light in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
The aim is to return drivers behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a course of traffic rehearsal.
In addition to the National Office for Traffic Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers accused of driving in drunkenness more than once will sit behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if a higher than the permitted alcohol concentration is recorded.
The price is more than €1,000 and must be paid by the defendant.
A study conducted in this regard in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced infringements by 65% in the first year after introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, since legal regulation can be carried out in the usual manner, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been test-installed in some industrial cars and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), which recommends installing this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40, as scheduled, an aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico D.F., in which the prince and princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just sinking, but its rays still force their hands to close their eyes so that they could see the successor pair coming out of the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood under the ladder.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish prince and the princess were coming on a state visit.
- Yeah, so it's great, it's not going to get to the airport at that time to pick up people...She's from there or what...
“No, no, sir, she’s Spanish, but she’s lived here for a few years.
Oh yeah, that’s...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how significant their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which is made up of 27 naval soldiers ready to shoot the honorary salve.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue costume, and the princess, very modestly dressed and with loose hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently to her that a storm is threatening in D. F.
Before entering the hall where the official delegation awaits, they smile at the photographers and unforcedly impress them.
In the door of the hotel where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a famous Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Best Subsidized Fashion Price
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no more famous designer than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable the international presentation of new fashion talents.
The prize is subsidized in the amount of 300,000 euros.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga exhibition on Haussmann Boulevard No. 54 in Paris and almost cried.
Certainly, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer Valentin for taking over the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to eventually have a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera House in Paris.
The presidential table, solemnly decorated by Mango, looked even more remarkable alongside Chagall’s most remarkable works.
Nati, who, with a heartbroken grief over her brother’s recent death, gave nothing to the public, wore the brand’s dress and ELAH jewelry, over which the breath was hidden, and hanging in her son Luise – a two-foot elegan – accompanied Valentina at the table’s front at dinner in his honour.
Andik, the boss and owner of the Mango company, was welcomed and, as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a sack, as they both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived in the store in - own-handed - trousers and shirts and dressed in long black sexy dresses for dinner, was touched by a night walk through the Opera with Goya Toledo, showed us the hall for ballet trials and, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and indicated a "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stop visiting the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Oliver Martinez – another young man riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who came to the Paris Intercontinental Hotel with his own bedding and towels and asked in advance that no smells be used in his rooms.
Under the starry sky of Paris.
C’est la vie.
1001 – Anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and furious everyday life.
And to not be too little, they are all summarized in one book, which will bring relax to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hasty rhythm that the present life brings.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two methods to fight day-to-day exhaustion and with problems to disconnect from the world of work.
No, this number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of yoga positions, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, has gathered a whole "menu" of options, adjusted to the taste and time options of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called “1001 Ways to Relax” and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing houses will bring peace to bookstores.
If someone considers that it is impossible to peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "guide" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If there is no adrenaline in your veins, which re-establishes balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Speaking of Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they are asleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you out, but in reality it’s meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly some of you have been told that he spoke from sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fever), or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every several months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is not a single reason to explain it.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nightmares, nocturnal enuresis (nocturnal pomočing) or moonlight, but it may not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stressful or upset situations.
This is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great strength, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes much anxiety in him and thus manifests itself.
We said it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by remembering a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before going to bed.
Look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent television programs or series.
For very nervous children and those to whom work can relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
When somnilokvia appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that from what happened, the next day he will no longer remember anything.
Useful Advice
Do not be him.
This is useless because he is unconscious and you interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if several times in a row it seems to you that he is very worried, it would be advisable to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It will be useless, because when he is asleep, he is not conscious so that he can arrange his thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks of and why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s nothing wrong, it’s just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long period of leaning.
Without playing a big match, the yellow-black created more chances and managed to transform one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to promote.
After the first attempt by the captain of the guests, Kauffmann, who shot from a distance only about the hair missed the connection, began to have Illhaeusern slightly above and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive fence in the middle of the pitch and left only the agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie’s two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well situated for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
Gólman Illhaeusernu, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his fellow players in weakening.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to profit from this, and the eleven from Illhaeusern, who had only pulled a little back to "dump" the defense, did not cause any major difficulties, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball, after a great mess, flew very close to the ribbon.
Sarkozy goes to angry fishermen
Before heading to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a walk through Britain.
To face a demonstration of force by fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter have promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hope to "come up with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the sharp rise in diesel prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of 1.14 euros per liter.
A spokesman for the Elysee Palace, David Martinon, said the president would "talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure conditions for employing and paying seamen."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with relentlessness.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out the "chicken" operation in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing 10km of congestion.
The resort port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a filter barrier was deployed.
The sailors demonstrated their determination as early as Monday, when they burned tires and pallets in front of the fuel warehouses of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trailers remained in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait before they eventually decide to negotiate themselves, until a meeting at the ministry on Wednesday.
The "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday in Guilvines on how to continue its journey and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the state fishing union, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not let go of anything" and "do not want to arrive in Paris," said Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the fishing department in Loriento.
Professional fishermen who do not pay a diesel tax currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but judge that the threshold of profitability of the ship is reached only when the diesel is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman Great
The unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid tribute to the movie legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraerins its 2008 supply forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession floating over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, isining its supplies for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian engineer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.

AIG is considering selling 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, which has been hit by U.S. monetary authorities, is considering leaving more than 15% of its assets in order to repay $85 billion in advance, the Sunday issue of the Financial Times writes.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine a possible assignment.
No confirming statements were obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to get rid of include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments.
No final decision on these assignments has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the U.S. authorities will seize 80 percent of its capital, thus reducing the current shareholders to a proportion.
Analysis of the Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to rescue banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss close to 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
The largest point drop in its history (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day the trade resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to the final data after the closing of trading, 199,61 points to stabilize at 1 983,73, and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Summoned since the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally collapsed after the House of Representatives’ unexpected rejection of a plan to rescue banks, a plan that should allow some stability to be found again in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives refused to provide Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent by the market that sees Congress not able to adopt a certain plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late."
“If this project is indeed doomed to collapse (...), it will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to spark the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And emphasizing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings the fall of one financial institution."
Following Friday’s collapse of Washington Mutual, authorities organized a purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken turns and required urgent intervention in favor of banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not dealing “only with the American crisis, but with the global crisis,” added an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year cash return decreased to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday evening, and the 30-year return to 4.161% from 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama wins in first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, a second debate followed, the task of which was to find out who of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The campaign tents of the Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when they both announced their victory in a television duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, however decent, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the drop in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll released on Saturday attributes Obama a five-point lead (49 percent against 44 percent for McCain), judges that the Democrat was the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39 percent of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25 percent attributes the victory to McCain.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-candidate Joseph Biden, during his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It’s talented,” Bill Clinton said.
Seventy-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" in the issues at the heart of the first encounter.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to have understood that...” it sounded like repeated accusations.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican television spots have been carried since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that it represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama did,” a Democratic spot replied over the weekend, blaming the Republican for not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on the “ordinary American.”
“During this 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina.
He did not even pronounce words like "middle class" or "working".The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more apt to save the economy on the edge of the abyss.
"A decisive turn could take place next week," estimated influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democrat Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton’s administration, compared Obama’s “economic prudence” to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is “the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as pursued by George Bush and as supported by Sen. McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans, and also pointed out that implementing the country’s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial aid plan that Congress passed last night and which is highly unpopular.
“Have you noticed that there were elections in Minsk?”
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday night to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the polling stations on the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukašenko’s regime: “Dictator, resign.”
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the election: “Why would it be if they would do whatever they want with my vote?” says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has behaved friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn toward democracy.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusians and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the elections are considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this is not the case.
“We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count,” Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties, complained.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” stresses Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure of the pro-European movement, “because what matters is who counts the votes, and with us it’s the executive power.
If some opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean a place on television, meetings in regions, and draft laws.”
The opposition thus feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "it is necessary to start a dialogue with the European Union.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by the crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, will not declare the election valid.
It stresses that the participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What did you, have you noticed that there were any elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, the ones that most suit the regime."
The silence of the night was again on the square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulated each other on the success.
Interview - Blood That Is Again Certain
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, was justified by the fact that Héma-Québec has become one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the confidence of the public, which was seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is commonly known, the state blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave of public resentment, in February 1994, the Canadian government launched a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and formulating recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee was responsible for this role.
Following Gélineau and Krever’s report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be managed by Québec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
“The situation was devastating.
Through continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence,” he says and proudly adds that by the beginning of 2008 Héma-Québec was already trusted by almost 94% of the Québec population.
However, Dr. Decary does not lose sight of the fact that “confidence is something very fragile.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
“At that time, we witnessed many cases of human-like mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
“And we didn’t know if this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau Report, according to which, when we do not know it and when the spread of a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, is at stake, preventive measures should be taken.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who had stayed in the UK for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was proven that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us that it makes sense to stick to the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor blood, rather than the presence of the antibodies on which previously used tests were based.
NAT tests have shortened the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than a week.
This substantially reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without our knowledge.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that before someone gets HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product to appear.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary for recovery in absolute calm,” said the head of management of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what disease-causing element can appear in the system.
Last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by insect bites.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to safe supplies, Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supplies.
“The demands are growing because the population is ageing.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Québécois eligible to donate.”
Every healthy person at least 18 years of age, meeting the criteria of admissibility, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people who donate blood are not accepted on average because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud fever runs, they are excluded for a year.
“With these 3% we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Defects are very rare.
However, members of the donor network should be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to donate blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so untouched today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” Francine Decary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000 blood samples from the umbilical cord into the bank and we expect to collect over 1,000 each year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes the program of blood collection from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and at the same time decisive match of the quarter-finals played on the total number of goals to the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders from Seattle.
Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute.
In the second half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to deal with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
On Friday, during the first of the two quarterfinals, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwile, Seattle.
Impact will match Whitecaps from Vancouver in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, Thunder matched home with a deficit of 3:1 and eventually won 4:3, but Whitecaps still went to the semi-final round with a total number of goals of 5:4.
Impact is expected to face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details about the series of matches will be confirmed today.
Short: Kovalev's victory goal
The first three Canadians are ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrei Kosticin last night in Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two assists and Kovalev scored one record in this fourth three-colour victory out of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the separate raids.
“I’m not ready yet,” Rus warned.
“I need another game to feel good.”
“In the first half, he tried to handle too much,” said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a great applause.”
Charest bets on the North
He does not rule out the possibility of holding early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today’s supplementary elections.
“Destroying the boundaries of our last great northern border”: this is the long-standing ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the conclusion of the Liberal Party Congress of Quebec in Levis, without revealing any details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a kind of painting mill.
On three huge canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric barricades, down, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generosity, as in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the possibility that early elections would be held in the autumn, although he noted that he had a very busy schedule.
The "North Plan" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" the prime minister intends for Québec, the vision of a "new economic space" that includes a workforce agreement with France, a convention between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has recently frequently mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a “jewel with enormous potential”, but did not specify the timing, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned several approaches to points that could be further divided: mainly hydropower plants, forestry, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory twice the size of France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it’s not just in us, it’s in us,” he said, as if he wanted to show that he is referring to a national founding myth.
Québec was built largely in relation to the North, the prime minister highlighted: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after theatrically silencing to look at the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec’s territory, includes the part of the Labrador that Quebec has always sought, the prime minister said during a press conference.
“This is a tradition that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one border line that has not been agreed on for a long time, and if an appropriate opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "in the context of climate change, we also need to rethink our Northern vision," he said, speaking of the north-west transition, which will open year-round due to the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying territory becomes a duty.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former pequist MP from Ungavy), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
It was initiated by an inter-ministerial committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be outlined".
The development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as continuing with the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the topics of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival at the party’s head.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to overturn Beauharnois’s headquarters at the Adélard-Godbout barrier.
“From Godboute, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourass, who created the Bay of James, our party has been able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
At a press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When the line came to Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stressed that its launch is scheduled for 2012.
"I say it only between us, but I plan to be there," he told his member base, provoking a lot of applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of holding elections in the fall of this year, which is permitted by law.
However, he stressed that his agenda is loaded, by the Federal Council’s mission in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend’s congress provided the leader of the liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular some “constitutional amendment attempts” that went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also wants Québec to appoint a portion of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have veto rights in the case of decisions taken in Québec.
From the opposition side, the Plan North was taken with skepticism in its main features.
Leader of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois resumed the Northern Quebec Development Policy, which Landry’s government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced this policy.
If she held on, “we would go on today,” Marois noted alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
“But we want it not to be just a theater,” explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is returning today from a vacation.
Letters - The Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of “justice” (o irony) in Harper’s cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that it was a “shame” for Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has led an unwavering struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the prime minister’s surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us that, as the only of all the Western countries involved, has not brought back to the homeland a citizen imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t take into account the fact that at the time of the acts that were being blamed on him, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one that relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant’s guilt.
UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
The same government is closing its eyes to torture: it does not care much about the fact that this young man is psychologically destroyed, and it is undoubtedly permanent, after so many years of torture.
We don’t realize it, but we’re witnessing the plunging erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” the words that Harper has so much to say and that sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him according to the will of the chief of the so far minority government (as it will be after October 14 ...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toewsi, is in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Orwell’s Discourse by Barrick Gold
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell’s logic, he confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has initiated prosecution against three authors and a poor little publisher for insulting honour in order to provoke “transparent public debate” and demands six million dollars for them.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for insulting honour, but the law.
It is not surprising that Garver completely omits this fundamental distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate to bring down anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process ends up, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums of money to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a very uneven battle with an army of lawyers supported by the flawless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic in these uneven battles, after all, often consists in ruining the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will shut the mouths of the counterparty and, in addition, scare anyone who dares to deal with the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the whole matter to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate normally lies in the exchange of ideas, and not in the wounds of the obesity.
Therefore, it was not enough for mining companies to open their books, their documentation, and set up a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole matter.
Barrick Gold, however, appears to have no confidence in the public opinion and is shamelessly rejecting petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Per Garver could explain how he could demand a “public debate” while contempting the opinions of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president’s world only refers to fat-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow concept of the term.
In a democracy, people have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand — or does not want to understand — that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the case, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant is to be thrown into the mouth (as part of his prosecution of "public debate" Barrick, by the way, has just submitted an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
If we ignore Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to investigate and seek the truth, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
In general, it denies the right to quote trusted sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada it will be impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the wealthy companies of this world without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could form it if it followed the scientific standards used by Noir Canada authors.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has no desire to conduct a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as is it for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures to limit this type of unjustified prosecution.
Operation to Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand Each Other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally agreed on the biggest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to curb the financial crisis that has haunted Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages better control by elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-payment, and also the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets,” said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the current Wall Street crisis," he said.
“This is a crucial point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption of American everyday life will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last few hours, the negotiations started at the highest turns out of fear of the effect that a further failure would have on the investor’s mood.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both U.S. presidential candidates were later invited to negotiate and both expressed preference for the agreement, without forgetting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama added to the agreement a number of measures, in particular one aimed at enabling owners to retain their homes, and measures on the salary of managers of state-saved companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,” he explained on television waves.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would like to see the details, but I hope it does."
“The brute traits I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’ll all have to spend and with which it will be possible to move forward.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to buy back dubious debts and venture capital assets from U.S. financial institutions for taxpayer money.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis sparked by a bubble in the real estate market that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes), then moved to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAAs) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The fall of the first draft agreement from last week has been on the conscience of Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats agreed that the government would only guarantee some of the “toxic” assets of companies in trouble, but would not buy them, there has been a belief that the out-of-the-counter situation has been struck.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a measure was attached stipulating that the government would be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if, as a result of the program, it would have to bear losses for a period of five years.
The new plan includes a first deposit of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The next $350 billion will be approved by Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in the saved firms, which in case of profit will be paid dividends, and which he will be able to sell again when it is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay procedures for seizure of properties related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The planners would like to submit it to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will get green.
Yesterday, votes in both the Republican and Democratic camps continued to rise against the bill.
“It’s quite obvious that Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s finance committee, said.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But paying taxes is not the solution.”
Democrat Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the “committee of skeptics,” presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred respected professors of economics, including three Nobel prize winners, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully examine which path to take,” he said.
At the same time, Europe has once again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following an extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the brink of collapse since it lost €2.9 billion as a result of the U.S. mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe.
“We will not lose that money,” Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said.
In return, we get voting rights in the bank and influence.
And that’s what households and households can appreciate in these uncertain times.”
On the other side of the Channel, the British government appears to have initiated the nationalization of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government was supposed to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41.5 billion ($75.5 billion) were real estate loans.
According to his announcement yesterday, the branches and accounts of clients of the British bank will be purchased by the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty with blue eyes long represented his trumpet, according to others, a weakness.
Has this American actor gone out of narcissism with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unwavering talent that were inherent to him also kept him away from the power category that gives rise to real stars.
What a long run!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he was similar and long a kind of film rival, Newman was a more cautious actor, more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful babies.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was Hungarian.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American Dream.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw the whole country falling in love with the self-made man, a warrior in the Pacific, wounded in a battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumphs in the theater, television and soon in film.
The same man, who fought for civil rights, was also a car racer, second in the 1979 Le Mans 24-hour race, and a sex symbol, despite forming an exemplary couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the shadowy spots of this hidden, discrete, socially engaged star, allergic to the whisper of their own show business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious, also leave.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend caused dizziness among film lovers, while his big roles compete on the black canvas of memories.
After him, he defiles for more than half a century of constantly changing American Seventh Art.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Burning Roof, an adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From a less recent past (1990) we find his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have entered history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a tortured, violent, unforgettable criminal from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role for James Dean, taken after his death, which made Newman truly known in 1956.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
In The Hustler (1961), he plays the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which brings him the only seven-nominated Oscar in 1987.
This journeying face of ages, it was him.
And again he.
Different periods of his career compete with each other.
Young people know him especially thanks to the iconic Slap Shot by George Roye Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He then ended his career with the role of an Irish mafia baron in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, who soon left the craft, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with his glamorousness and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded it, not without humor, as a “living challenge to underplaying,” judging that in his performances he pushed too much on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came like on the bench, the profession was not always so gentle.
The first lovers, however, he played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumpy and desperate, whose falls and rebellions were reflected in his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed the little-known side of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose, he dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness.
In an uproar of tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former co-star Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly stated: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main qualities of a deceased actor.
If we ignore his legendary career, he is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, an opponent of the downfall of Hollywood.
We were used to seeing his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which may have seemed quite unpleasant to us, although it was originally a gag.
However, the proceeds from the sale went to his Foundation for Difficult Childhood account.
Newman thus, rather than allowing himself to be stunned by fame, engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life path of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
And after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & spol facturing factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
In addition to other crimes, including counterfeiting of documents, the politician and his associates are charged with fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, which has resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money raised in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and local governments – a total of approximately 65 million forints – went partly to the box office of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which it also informed the investigating authority, was that the funds obtained in public tenders were collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual compensation and never received the commitments taken by the association.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
The printing of these invoices came from the Józefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of the companies on which the production of invoices is to be carried out were decided, among other things, on the tour of the northern shore of Balaton, to which the Istvan Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his testimony, he was first appointed to look out for pensions and restaurants.
In them he requested accounts for his consumption, according to which the models were then produced invoices submitted within the framework of public competitions issued, inter alia, by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Capital Government.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his “study journey,” Lados looked for one cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this hospitality facility provided catering for a group of 90 members from Biztos Pont.
However, so many people, according to the head of the company, would not enter this facility at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was full of formal and content errors.
The pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet there were one hundred and thirty guests on the invoice.
However, the rich-fantastic printers exaggerated this even when they listed a company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., in whose accounting, according to the information provided to the Prosecutor's Office, the documents sounding at the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even figure.
The head of the company Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and our tax number were stamped in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, it did not agree that according to the invoice they accommodated a hundred people, because they have only eleven rooms, which do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food was also listed on the invoice, while their restaurant has not been operating for a long time.
The ardent producers of invoices did not convince themselves that the visited Budapest travel agency organizes only foreign trips, and on the invoice with cash payment, which also did not coincide with the invoice practice of the company, they foolishly referred to as a travel agency in Hungary.
Furthermore, as it emerged during the investigation, they also indicated VAT in the document, although the organization of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed, among other things, with the amount of VAT. The company’s activities were not subject to the above mentioned 25 percent, but 15 percent VAT, and the hotel staff issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "publishers" corrupted the invoice, for example, by stating that one company, as revealed by the prosecution investigation, carried out the road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment advice did not carry out.
In addition, the fact that the invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont associations are fake has also been collapsed due to formal deviations – the invoice format and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s.r.o. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association dined with it, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
Consciously issued invoices
The second group of invoicers are those who knew they were going to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued accounts worth approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Socialisták.
According to the indictment, the head of the company Collab s.r.o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices worth approximately five million forints, behind which there was no actual economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the created invoices were later cancelled, which, however, the organizations forgot to state in their documents.
The other group of invoicing companies included those that had ties to the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the representative of the Ukrainian operator of Delta Trió s.r.o., a company dealing with fuel and motor vehicle trading, headquartered in Budapest, where no company can be found.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for sales of computing equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data obtained by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company’s manager was a man from Romania, to whom Ivan Kubatov had also handed over documents relating to the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the associations Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and himself accepted their compensation.
Explicitly at the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian wallworkers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the accused, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him by issuing invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció affiliated with Zuschlaga at the request of his co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The Prosecutor’s Office found that Kubatov received 10 percent of the amounts stated on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for a tender by the Mihálye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a socialist party public benefit organization.
They earned 500,000 forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a home search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, part of the defendants will probably describe the course of the invoice production, as they have already done at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main accused János Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His previous statement is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, the Socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it on.
He could still be offended, as his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely to be placed in house arrest, have not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes who have inflicted much greater damage, which they have not yet paid, are free to walk around or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he has no such possibility.
Psychology of Trumping: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalu goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known – and seemingly irrational – behavior have been revealed by researchers from the Neuroscience and Economics Department of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lag behind in an eBay auction competition, so they’d rather pay too much.
Research using an experimental auction attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a game auction, using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to examine the active brain regions of the subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, the important element of which is to overthrow the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensely when losing.
This brain region, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price screw can be explained by an attempt to avoid a sharp striat reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team of economists conducted a cross-sectional financial investigation.
Three groups were offered against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
Members of another group were also promised that if they came out of the game victoriously, they would receive another $15 in reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but lost the money in the event of a loss.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was that one was emphasized a win and the other a loss.
However, members of the group playing against the loss were willing to go higher than in the control and “win-win” group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
Until now, they explained the phenomena observed at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped us solve the contradiction between the two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York’s School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characteristic of liver inflammation and jaundice, but the cause of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen, spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against the A and B viruses, against type C vaccine does not exist.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, urge to vomit.
Then yellowing, lightened stools and darkened urine will form on the skin and eyelids, and treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious type of this disease, from liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that only one in ten infected people is treated with medication.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the cause of the disease destroys liver cells callously, and so the first symptoms appear in many cases only in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention and regular screening are very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than the average: among people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his doctor if he notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
With timely detection, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infectiousness and preventing cancer.
World Hepatitis Day is celebrated on September 30th, which was first held worldwide in 2004.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God does not suffer?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a kind of analgesic that may have made death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how a person's belief in a god affects the perception of pain, the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholics and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of thoroughly examining the human brain, the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first of a series of studies in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university also participate.
The test was carried out by attaching a scintillating instrument to the test subject’s left hand, which produced electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to look closely at two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary dating from the 17th century and the Lady of Leonard da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would bring about a certain state of piety among the believers, while the Da Vinci painting was chosen because it did not differ much from the first and appeared reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time they received 20 electro-shocks in four consecutive sections, while watching the image separately with a religious or general theme.
Catholics that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe”, as if they were “cared for” and “reassured, filled with peace.”
They felt 12 percent less pain when they watched a religious-themed picture than when they had Leonard’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any highly impressive image even in atheists, only to find the right photo.
"We would have to find a picture that they will see very positively, from the position of the mother or father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing faith should change, and in many cases it will change, our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the pain regulation of believers if they were shown some madonna by Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would a look at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share.
On its tenth birthday, Google can state that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they’ve been on vacation, what expert examinations they’re going for, and what they’re interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the chief executives of the company, this is still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics are concerned, making a parallel to Orwell’s dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary in order for the founders of Google to stick to their original intention, which was: "Let's arrange all the information in the world!"
According to a spokesman for Google, even after ten years of worldwide work, the company is only at the beginning of working with all the information.
Asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as “what am I going to do tomorrow?” or “what work would actually work for me?” – such seemingly simple questions, however, software won’t be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during internet searches the searches are accurately captured, as well as from which IP address it was searched and to which pages the interested parties moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their surfing history, look back at what they have sought and what they have clicked on, thanks to which in the long term finds are generated more directly tailored to them - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer products and services based on the previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I’m dealing with? – users who are scared when they look at Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the scope of the potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not arouse in Internet users guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known example in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites established through it.
Internet users who are concerned about personal rights, however, could still breathe in May, when the firm hand in hand with the e-rights protection organization EFF successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully defeated fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it obtained with reference to the reinforcement of the Children’s Protection Act adopted years ago, yet it failed to get the lists of individual users’ search items, respectively, complete lists of websites and keywords covering a two-month period.)
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is beaten by those who fear disclosure of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by starting to use Google’s services, and stand against it with revolt, as belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wildness, gathering around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see a new generation of big companies in him, the “corporation that now fricts,” unlike his rival Microsoft, considered to conquer the world because of Windows, though they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money from them for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, younger, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with it one of the most famous keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
In fact, the Web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, about the fact that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can maintain a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording his listened music, all this can then connect to navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can write a blog on which his latest photo galleries will automatically appear, which he stores on Flickr or Picasa.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at a flood of photos of common friends, easily finds out with whom her shitty boyfriend spent the evening, or the company can fire her employee just because she outlines her honest opinion about top management on her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely re-evaluated today.
The one who lives an online life consists of what it shows out, so we could define the basic thesis hiding behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google’s monopoly has the option (starting with Scroogles, who uses Google’s search engine, but does not intentionally leave traces).
Google’s online apps from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not make us the best possible profile.
Public opinion is not very secretly expecting when Google will show the teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten advertising agency investments, and services deployed at an ever-accelerating rate seriously disrupt the lives of not only Microsoft, but also numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counter-points that make a disturbing impression: the top management, for example, completely rejected employees' protests after raising the corporate kindergarten fee to double, any frequent daily meals of employees were too expensive, according to the company's management, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google even in 2006 bowed before the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, filters out any findings that cause good taste, respectively, the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company’s internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance until they can be used, but it’s certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years may overwhelm the world in new places: while some believe that Google’s project to scan and archive books and magazines is gaining such size that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear its Health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, Cory Doctorow’s famous novel “Scroogled” describes with Orwell’s reminiscences a future in which one can approach man scaryly well only with the help of data from Google.
Double murderer helped remove the traces of two youths
Two minors were interrogated by the police in the case of a double murder in Oz, according to reasonable suspicion of helping to remove the traces of this crime, a spokesman for the Supreme Police Directorate of Borsod County said on Tuesday.
The persons have confessed to the activity they were suspected of and are currently charged with assisting in the crime.
Both minors, according to MTI information two girls, are being prosecuted on freedom.
Helping a criminal offence is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder in Oz, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into temporary detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of committing a planned murder for several reasons.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a greater amount to the 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so his creditor drove last Wednesday to one of the establishments in Ózú, where he killed first a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros – approximately five billion Czech crowns – were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100-percent package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side even though the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish offer represents the highest amount that has been offered to the Prague stock exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the deal, approximately 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent stake, followed by Czech Savings with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European papers
In Tuesday’s comments on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers have already recalled the “second September 11th.”
We can thank the American president for the global financial disaster, La Repubblica accuses.The president was not even able to shake his own party to support the swiftly repayed bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could rather talk about the second September 11th.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, a lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is constantly increasing, and the entire world will eventually pay for it.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool for resolving the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifecycle to the wallowing monetary institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if other banks collapse like the dominoes, then neither money nor improvisation will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to move over their national egoism and unite control over the fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday, the postponing monetary institutions received more than 100 billion euros, the Viennese Der Standard recalls, according to which fears that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to go deep into their pockets in order to solve the crisis are increasingly real.
The European Union has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is rolling over the old continent like a tsunami, until now.
“Rescue workers” may not have to mow hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they had decided firmly in which case it would be reasonable to use taxpayers’ money to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates flight
What would probably be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not the imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the CEATEC in Japan, was inspired by Nissan engineers who were involved in building a new generation of collision-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has developed the BR23C biomimetic robotic steering system, a robotic mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate any collisions.
“During flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety protective envelope,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, the brand’s chief executive for technological PR and R&D.
The compound eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters ahead of the BR23C in a 180-degree field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is caught within a fraction of a second, then the robot car begins to mimic the movements of the bee and, by turning the wheels in the range necessary to prevent a collision, immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver is carried out in a completely instinctive way.
“If it didn’t, a robotic car’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Tošijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety protective envelope, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than a blink of the eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or angularly, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding them, the robotic car has only used the possibility of rotating, accelerating and slowing.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, instinctive, intelligent response is important, not processing ability, let alone data storage.
This mechanism has to process and respond only to a few incoming signals per second.
He doesn’t need to store them and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so he constantly uses only a few kilobyte memory.
It does not require a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of an instantaneous avoidance technology that, according to Nissan’s estimates, could get into mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another option could be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which would, after avoiding obstacles in the way, lead the driver to the specified final destination.
The baby has a name already.
The $700 billion bailout package, which is to be divided into several repayments and aimed at buying back low-quality loans from banks, is already in written form.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further talks, which ended on Saturday after midnight, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days-long debate on a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters.
“We’ve made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairwoman of the House of Representatives, saying it’s only about signing an agreement.
The deal was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the compromise: “The program will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken.”
The written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. (Washington time) (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise in the stock markets.
The draft legislation entitled the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which is to be established on the agenda, will be voted first by the House of Representatives on Monday, and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, after which the news of the deal was also welcomed in the White House.
“We are pleased with the progress we have made last night and greatly appreciate both sides’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, after all, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which meant that a total of $700 billion would be spent on the repurchase of low-quality securities secured by mortgages.
It is now possible to spend in the first round a maximum of half the amount of 700 billion, and that 250 billion will be used immediately after Congress is expected to decide on the matter on Monday, and the Treasury Department will buy securities secured by mortgages that are rated as poor quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the decision of the president.
The program will be supervised by a special board, a member of which will also be the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of the $700 billion will depend on a further decision by Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy back low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other “toxic” loans.
The purchase can be carried out in the framework of auctions and directly, the competent officials of the Ministry said.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee on funds that are reasonable for concern, for which the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system, spending up to $700 billion, whether it be large-scale purchases of bad funds, their insurance, or preventing the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
Bank bosses who are in trouble and waiting for help from the state, on the contrary, can count on the government reducing their departure fees – which is simply called “golden parachute” in overseas slang.
The limitation of their payments will only occur in certain cases, in addition, these limitations will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, gold parachutes will be taxed if the falling bank executives are not retired straight away.
In the case of direct repurchase of low-quality loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction will only apply to new contracts, which is to be an additional incentive to participate in the program.
"This is the first case in U.S. history where legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs will come into effect," said Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state will have the right to obtain a share in the banks participating in the program, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since once the economy and the rescued bank stand up, they can make a profit from the transaction.
In the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress on how the expected financial sector losses can be reimbursed to taxpayers.
Of course, there were voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
“We were not asked for this by American citizens, because this won’t protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman from California.
His Ohio Democratic counterpart, Mary Kaptur, believes that those who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street urged the bill to be adopted.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month, then by 12.9% compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office.

Also, domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors increased slightly, by 0.1 percent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2,8 percent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the manufacturing of bracelet and peasant products by 4.6 percent, and the production of footwear by 2.5 percent, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly price rise in the chemical materials and products industry (1,6 percent).
Prices dropped in the oil processing sector (1,4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0,9 per cent), as well as – to a minimum extent – in the wood processing sector (0,1 per cent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 to 0.9 percent.
In the production and distribution sector of electricity, gas and water, which has a large weight in the domestic sales of industry, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continued influence of the officially determined increase in gas prices taking place since July 1.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in the individual sectors of the processing industry, prices increased the most in the specialized oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical sector, prices increased by 13.2 percent, in the food, beverage and tobacco sector, which has a decisive weight, then by 11 percent.
Prices dropped in the textile and textile products sectors (2.5 percent) and in the electrical machinery and appliances sector (0.3 percent).

In the consumer goods sectors prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy processing and further processing sectors prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 percent).
In consumer goods industries, prices increased by 6.8 percent, while in material assets prices fell by 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, falling by 3.9 per cent in a twelve-month comparison.
Within a month, our domestic currency weakened 1.7 percent against the euro, 7.1 percent against the dollar, 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar compared to August 2007.
Travel to the United States without a visa next year?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a great hope that the U.S.-Hungary visa-free deal will enter into force around January 12, the Foreign Minister spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "now almost everything depends only on whether an electronic system for travel permits and checks will be established on time at sea."
At the same time, it said that the new system will not include a permit to enter, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The Hungarian Foreign Ministry is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will be awarded the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and will conduct talks with foreign policy advisors of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday to support the government’s $700 billion bailout package, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a several-day marathon of negotiations between Congress and administration officials, early Sunday morning was announced: a basic agreement on a bank rescue package was reached.
The financial package, which aims to overcome the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree that they are the most suitable candidate to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, as economic issues came to the forefront, Obama gained a certain advantage again and McCain’s lead, which he secured after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin for vice president, disappeared.
On Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the $700 billion bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
“We must act immediately, responsibly... your jobs, your savings, your entire industry, the stability of the entire economy are at risk,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn’t miss the opportunity to call McCain’s ideas about the economy outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It’s going to be a bit annoying for everyone... but doing nothing is simply not a possible way.”
As stated by the Republican senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the withdrawal fee for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a substantial role in the talks, but was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Monday.
Press Release of German Language Region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyses the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haider are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the leftist German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled “The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers.”
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began much before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of times is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and therefore for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
A decade ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the Stoiber period so often recalled.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country, and which is eating up its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong in the pace.Secularization, educational outcomes, the settlement of Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with an increase in opportunities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more confident, more critical, more self-sufficient.
It is also apparent that in recent weeks the classical civil classes have been the most distant from the CSU; freelancers, businessmen, graduates and university graduates.
The support for CSU dropped below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? Party chairs are restrained in coalition matters", deals with the confused internal political situation arising as a result of the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, the Greens are not yet willing to negotiate a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the chairmen of the parties have not allowed themselves to look into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is possible – in some federal states and in social partnership.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as deputy chancellor, Faymann left open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overrated for every drop.
Repetition in this direction is not considered.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is yet completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ Chairman Jörg Haider was once again open in all directions.
“In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility,” Haider said.
The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken.
The European Equality Summit, which this year is hosted by France, the current presidency of the European Union, has begun today in Paris.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People’s Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert discussion in her message addressed to the plenary session, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injuries affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was opened on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners, leading European rights organisations and equal opportunities associations were invited to attend the meeting.
According to the press office of a group of MEPs, the Fidesz movement Járóková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of workforce, Roma are pushed out of the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
“The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education, and because of the poor quality of primary education, only a small percentage of them can higher education.”
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in applying other human rights.
Investing in early childhood education for Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
It is necessary to strengthen the awareness of these contexts in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely they will be to become a productive member of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through income taxes and excise taxes.
“It is the right of their European Union citizenship for Roma to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their less-quality and separate education,” said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, coherence of the European Union with emphasis on the goal and action is needed in order to accelerate the processes of school desegregation immediately, and the correct observance of existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of paramount importance.
“We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we need to give Roma children the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can participate in the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens,” she said.
Everyone is guaranteed the goal of the European Summit on Equality, held annually since last year’s meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of equality and elimination of discrimination set out at European and national level.
CSU: Temporary Grace
Huber-Beckstein's fate will be decided by the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the Bavarian CSU.
Party Chairman Erwin Huber and country Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party’s extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
Members of the highly criticized duo have in any case been told that they will not stick to their positions with all their strength.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded the day after the “Bavarian tsunami” personal consequences.
Five years ago, indeed, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but its strengths were only 43.4 percent.
The CSU has been the “self-governing” in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP, for 46 years.
Conservatives still hold a high position in the southern federal country, which is crucial for Hungary’s economy, but in the future they will be forced into a coalition.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of the narrow intelligence team that will start the probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-wing Free Voters group, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that the candidate of the Free Voters was Gabriele Pauli, whose appearance against Stoiber was used by the duo Huber-Beckstein to conduct a coup, but then with an ambitious municipal politician did a ruthlessly short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, an active role will also be attributed to Stoiber, who has so far sprinkled the background, the former prime minister and former CSU chairman called September 28 the most painful day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several annoying remarks to the CDU, saying he would have deserved much greater support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success of 2005, joins forces to stand on its feet.
According to Merkel, who was hard to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin big coalition.
This is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD scored in Bavaria with 18.6 percent, the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko: Opposition - 110:0
No opposition member entered the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the irregularities that occurred in the vote count.
The OSCE, which has 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member parliamentary body of a country of 10 million has been missing the opposition for well ten years, the opposition grouped under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday’s elections had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who allowed himself to re-establish his presidential mandate for the fourth time on the basis of a constitutional change in the contested 2006 elections, this time would “allow” a few opposition deputies to appear in parliament.
The ODS also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
The backdrop of the opposition’s expectations was that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia – which took credit to mitigate the impact of the ever-pricing Russian gas imports and also contributed to bringing Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipelines passing through the country, into Russian hands – wished to improve relations with the European Union, where due to the Belarusian political establishment rated as antidemocratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians are not allowed to enter.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE, when evaluating the pre-election campaign, emphasized positive shifts, not shortcomings - for example, a ban on the candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE flash report on Monday, however, had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in even smaller confrontations with Moscow, as it continues to refuse to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia separated from Georgia, although Russia, with whom Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers these two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevič told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it remain so, despite the fact that "the opposition has taken a lot of time to get into the insignificant parliament of the only member of the opposition."
Looking at the results, the opposition is not planning a protest, rather it is trying to deliver its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, distribution is hindered by local authorities, but I see that more and more people are supporting change, even among the elderly," Milinkevič said, pointing to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not regard it as correct or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security will collapse," Milinkevič said.
In contrast to the opposition politicians, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergey Lebedev, told the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that rotating doors have been introduced for the arrival and departure of staff.
But from now on, this new measure will start to work against foolish people, against those who bite and then go for coffee during working hours.
The novelty against lazy people was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maure Masi.
"The rotating door," says Brunetta, "is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“This is a new era of transparency and responsibility.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation of the Presidency of the Council in all buildings.
For Masi, “the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There were no objections from the staff, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a common approach with the staff and the cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, “There’s nothing better than a good cappuccino at seven in the morning.”
During a conference at the Higher Professional School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public servants for illness has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60 thousand people more per year at work".
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more effective.
“Their pay dynamics – explains the minister – have doubled over the past 8-10 years in relation to the private sector and are far higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public officials have gathered to reject the standards of the Brunett Decree in line with a request supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration will present figures today regarding lower absences from work due to illness – writes the consumer protection association – the nation of ‘strict lazy’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
Protests will be held in Tar, in particular, against the exclusion of supplements for sick leave, which depends on activities; the extension of the time in which the sick can be checked, the time range in which the check visits will be carried out, and other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational Accidents, Napolitano: “Resolute Prevention”
Every day there are 2,500 work accidents in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail figures confirm that in 2007 we had approximately 1,200 deaths as a result of work accidents.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the number of deaths compared to murders.
To restore the attention of institutions, social and media on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Occupational Accidents, established on the second Sunday in October.
“The worrying data spread by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety,” Republic President Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for the Disabled and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his vivid admiration for the continued joint effort to ensure safety in the workplace, to protect wounded workers, to assist the families of victims and to promote public participation.”
“Naturally, the outrageous ‘good enough’ has been raised, honestly shared in the face of tragedies which, by their magnitude, provoke media agitation and public participation, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem with resources: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
Numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are gaining particular importance in order to raise awareness among young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini, on his part, stressed “how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and compels all institutions to make convincing efforts toward the necessary end of this state.”
“As far as work-related accidents are concerned, they appear to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to work-related accidents is alarming anyway,” said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmila.
“We’t want this ‘reduction snag’ to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, a tragedy breaks out.
“We believe that too little is being done in general to stop the accident problem, and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion – Mercandelli emphasized – to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervente more strongly in the field of staff training, and this right from school age.”
“There needs to be further efforts,” he added, “in terms of communication and public participation.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is needed for a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon.”
Mercandelli ultimately stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation envisaged for work victims and the “displacement of supportive care” to which the system has come in recent years.
“The goal is therefore to return the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifts from time to time by the legislator.”
MP3 Players Accused, Exposing Hearing to Risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a announcement released today by the European Commission, which in an official report spread in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Committee for Science on health risks that have recently emerged and have been identified (Csrseri) EU.
"This scientific opinion suggests that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a week and keep the device at high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
“It worries me that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in irreparable ways,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“The scientific findings – continues the leader – indicate a clear risk and need to react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to encourage consumers and disclose this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and keep pace with new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this issue in light of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
“The researchers confirm that concerns need to be made and now the European Commission will examine, together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could eventually be introduced to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable music instruments and similar devices.”
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damage by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its view, the Scientific Committee of the EU states that users of portable music instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno leaves free course to the Commission for the future of the capital
We start today, we close in March, we have amounts in June.
This is the calendar Campidoglio gave to the workers of the “Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome”, which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up guides for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the city council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and its council Gianni Alemann.
“The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – Alemanno wants to emphasize – It will have to ensure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, who remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
It’s not about any exchange of functions, it’s just about trying to have a place to work on a big project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, as this institution must have a precise deadline.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary because its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: “It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as the Attali Commission’s proposals, and I’m sure in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often politics pay off on everyday problems and the urgencies that happen from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that “this Commission is neither a futile venture nor a bluff: it is completely free, it will not cost Rome’s citizens a single euro and it will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence the capital has.”
For Alemanna, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor immutable, in order to allow our city an authentic rise to the level it necessarily needs, and to think in a united spirit about its future."
A future that, specifies the mayor of Rome "will not be limited only to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama is the first anti-American president.
One famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy andined relations (as he is today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.”
The attacks on Obama are rising just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on the website: “This man is full of ambition.
“But Obama has a brazen mind: he thinks he’ll get to the top post of a nation that has two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these attacks do not say much”; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president?
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the southern part of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling station, we know very well whom an American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality, which remained hidden until the last moment, will come to light.
Say what you want, and eventually we’ll take care of who to mark, whether Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama had won, we would have left America.
These are things that have never been pronounced before, it seems almost certain success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent them home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to do a huge task.
Even journalists have felt the economic collapse of the United States: in the newspapers there is a period of investigation.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their prospects for the future.
Almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly say they were less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the newspaper, are a huge problem.
According to journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public to change fundamentally.
American journalists have a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and senior executives believe that journalism is on the wrong track on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which is viewed by many as a “killer” of print.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are alerting to has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted that they were resorting to technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism lies between those who run newsrooms – that is, executives – and reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with “work safety.”
Managers who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
The number of journalists is 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" related to staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a huge nation as the U.S., with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so it’s a question of taking or leaving.
Leaders almost always get huge salaries, and an editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month apart from paying pensions and insurance.
As for holidays, then, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until it reaches fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It is just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL trial in Rome, Danilo Coppola remains in Grottaferrato
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the filing of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who requested that he could move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counter offer at the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial, at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked a real estate entrepreneur to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which Mr. P. spoke) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon came to light a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout proposed by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, milder, friendly to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is on the contrary conservative, hostile to “them from Washington” and to the world of finance, strong especially in the central and southern states.
The soul that arrogantly expressed itself in the vote I talked about at the beginning.
But this just quoted thing is just an example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and not only here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, which are thickening in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category State-power in relation to a certain nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but which primarily involve the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This has created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically worldwide, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of play or that it has nothing to add: the European Union, which is, as always, divided between different interests and different state strategies, and which is unable to choose for a single common political line, has given an obvious proof.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each state, the rescue plans, the recovery of the market, the new rules and, most importantly, the distribution of funds: in a moment when we get into distress, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And they also have the necessary means and authority to use them: two resources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, after all, in perfect accord with the ever-increasing importance, which tries to attribute recent economic progress to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the web, an increasingly sophisticated technology, the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already predestined to rule the world, from nowhere we realized that our future, on the contrary, will have to face more and more with such little intangible things as water, grain, oil.
All things, whoever would say so, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to a confined space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler is sure to have much more cards in his sleeve than whoever is not, and whoever is unlucky to live in a place without grain, without diesel, and without water.
I come to the second novella, which, however, predicts the evil.
Whoever speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to arise.
On the one hand, the realization that objectively there is a need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who would be able to grasp the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditation towards existing leadership, especially economic, which has proved to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark spots.
And together something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discreditation, impatience, feeling incompetent and absent, which are trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
In fact, it seems to spread more and more in the broad masses of the population the belief that their actions are the same as the ideas of the so far popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, nourishes a branch underground, but the strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and the traditional political arrangement is manifested in sudden electoral “rejection” or in unexpected changes in collective moods in recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of the Labourists in the UK, to the uprising U.S. Congressmen against Bush (and the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasing difficulties to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is forming in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinforcing, growing, potentially too cloudy.
Before this, it would be exaggerated to speak of a permanent “mass rebellion”.
But we can’t say that it means having eyes open.
Superfit for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to the super glue and in the future walk through the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various U.S. research centers and now the team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a stokilogram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The foundation of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes laid like an arranged pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the gekon, covered with microscopic hairs, which allow the animal to ensure a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "is simply leaking off the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as a temporary glue" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk through the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating uses as the connection of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes yet.
Further research – The University of Berkley, California, is also working on new adhesives.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced a glue formed from micro-fiber like hair that cleanses itself from dust by moving across the surface to still maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never with juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes in strengthening or decreasing potency with serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at Western Ontario University in London, highlights the risks of both ready-made and fresh juices in combination with the ingestion of certain medicines, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new alarm is raised: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, to cancel their beneficial effects, and to put the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines, and neurological drugs.
The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medications, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
Not just grapefruit – According to experts, apple juice and orange juice also contain substances that reduce the use of medicines.
A long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, Director of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the drugs you get and if you encounter something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” emphasized the expert for the agency Ansa.
Nobel Prize in Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, in the days of Enron’s bankruptcy, Krugman predicted in a New York Times commentary that the second event would be, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that sparked a lot of controversy and was blamed for years, but proved to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest,” Krugman said in a statement in late 2002.
According to Lorenza Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “economist of great importance”, but also a popularizer who has a “very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration”.
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
Open Office.org 3.0, an open source package of personal production that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After approximately a year of work by volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is presented to the general public with a variety of new features: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will add more, much more substantial, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
The emphasis is also placed on collaboration with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a document even with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphic model and retain the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe format graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program, each collaborator is assigned one color to comments to make a clearer identification in the review phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should rebuild a definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, was added to the English version, which is on the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the theme of free of charge can be a trick to expand in households, it is in the business area of Open Office that the package plays a lot, and can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that is aimed at replacing Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, in the end, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are close to 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is possible that this estimated number can be even exceeded.
This is also the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the T-shirt of the best wrestler.
This was by L’Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver positive on the Cer, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohle’s blood samples fall into those taken in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the test results confirm positive results, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and face two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohle’s positivity to the Epo of the third generation was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the results of the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed in the winning stages behind the Spanish Carlos Sastro and the American Cadel Evansema, also won the pointed shirt of the best wrestler.
Immigrants: The New York Times: Is Italy a racist country?
Italy, “as a country of emigrants, has only in the last house become a priority destination for immigrants” received with resistance.
Is it turning a beautiful country into a nation of racists? so they ask in one long New York Times article that devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and started with the case of a young Abdula William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
The case highlights what the New York Times defines as the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” are recorded, but also “the strongest anti-immigration mindset in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League.”
To confirm the growing tensions between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation demanded by the Legea, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
A trend emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, the union for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“The phenomenon has already reached such a scale that entire layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia studios office, “in this city the high student demand has distorted the market in such a way that it has triggered a price hike that has spread to residents.”
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, no limited rent, associated subleases.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices thanks to a tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, one bed is needed for about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) through the average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum 900 (in Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones near the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single bed) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for single room in the zones of Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is student rent for students from outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italian.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the city cancels the historic halls
Historic cinemas are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes.”
The film, offered by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in major Italian urban centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of limiting the cinemas, the birth of large multisales in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosales in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that appear to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of true cultural crime.
“It’s as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of journey and a lot of emotions,” feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won Tornator an Oscar twenty years ago and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, and which told the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness for the way of life that the cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anecem, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed their doors, and the highest bill has been paid primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna ranks first with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex, it is these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multisales: 195 canvases more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian approach has developed irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anecu, “it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
Then let’s not even talk about the insufficient subsidy to the fund in favor of the operators: the previous government debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would require between 16 and 18 million euros per year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned with closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historic centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief in favor of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to go into a traffic-limited zone and will have special rates to stop and at some parking lots.
«This initiative I like» says Giuseppe Tornatore»and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheri, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale, where I have shared so many emotions that I don’t have to look at the inscriptions blackened by dust, I turn to the other side.”
The connection between politics and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the city government according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The charges raised by the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate against Mayor and Deputy Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone and Mayor Carlos Martelli of Rosarna, imprisoned this morning for external collaboration with the mafia organization, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote when two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to lawyer Piromallim.
"That would allow the mafia group to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the already enormous control and control of public administration."
The president of the Calabria Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are many secret deals between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his region: "There are areas where the mafia concentration is stronger than in others, where secret deals are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndranghetas, heroes who are still unspoiled'.
The arrests of this morning followed the arrests of July last year by which police showed that the Piromalli mafia group had received the final intervention.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was even the supposed connection between organized crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the leader of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of dissolution was elected head of the center-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He cried out over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolving of the municipal council.
He called on then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti to be held accountable and accused him of making all the wrong for political reasons, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even gone so far that it has requested a change in the design of the A3 motorway.
According to the prosecutors, further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion showed "the willingness to move the claims of the entrepreneur, a representative of a larger group very close to, as is commonly known, Piromallim, and to adapt the elections of public administration to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born out of waves, the great ones enter the game.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, and outflows are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the eyes of colossals such as Chevron are stuck, who are now trying to stretch their hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When oil prices dropped around the 1980s, the idea of using marine energy went aside.But now environmental organizations and a new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
This would be twice as much energy as is currently produced in nuclear centers.
There are also floods and flows and outflows.
Giants are attacking.
The company that made a bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than on traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company linked to the U.S. oil colossus told the Wall Street Journal, “and they are considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the sea energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also tracking the footprint of marine energy, and so far invested amounts, although not known in detail, show an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology needs to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology that is still in its early stages, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the medium.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fights that are interconnected with each other.
The force of the waves that moves with the booms up and down is changed by the help of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure within these booms.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy is delivered to the shore by submarine cables.
For now, four installations of this type are in the project phase, waiting only for federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for shopping centers and parking spaces using six offshore turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the tide and outflow causes the turbine to rotate, which feeds the generator with this rotating movement.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for necessary authorizations for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the outflow.
Particular interest at this point deserves the potential of influx and outflow, the Institute for Electrical Energy Research says.
Although this is an unrelated factor, tide and tide are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
New York, Maine, and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in flood and flood energy in 2008 and have forecasted investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
