Members of the National Assembly for Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are puppets.
Several members of the National Assembly for Wales are dismayed that they have been suggested to change their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly for Wales on the political scene fear that this will cause ridicule.
A Labour Party member of the National Assembly for Wales is concerned that it is ryming with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means obtuz and pwp means faecal matter.
A member of the Welsh Country Party in the National Assembly for Wales said that the nu group as a whole was delighted and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party stated that the group has an "open" attitude to the name change, but that he also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter w is pronounced in Wales as the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, stated: The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act provided the Assembly with the possibility to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them wanted to use the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the titling of the members of the National Assembly for Wales, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP but the option MWP received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that members of the National Assembly for Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give a headache to Elin Jones, chair of the steering committee, who is expected to send the amendment bill within weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly shall have the final say as to their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will express their opinion on changing their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's Episcopal Church have stopped ringing because of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"Historically, the veterans I spoke to told me that you used to find a bar and a church on every street corner", Adams said.
Today, there are no bars or churches.
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently these days", he said.
Bars are no longer the living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather.
And as for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expect and that, sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condos full of people that won't support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "so this will speed up the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condos will become members of those churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African-Americans  Metropolitan Community of St. Martin in 1870, a decade ago.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who were conducting religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an African-American congregation, led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the hiring or promotion of African-American persons.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon the "poor man's bells".
The expert who put the carillon into operation in July described it differently: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng at the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first carillon in the world to be operated by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What we've heard from St. Martin's in the last few months has been a complicated story, involving architects and contractors, some brought in by the church deacons, others from the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, consisting of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese was "seeking to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was swimming to catch lobsters in California on Saturday, the opening day of lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about a half hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy screaming for help and that he then moved along with a group who helped him out of the water.
Hammel also stated that at first he thought the boy was delighted to catch a lobster, but then realized that the call "M" had bitten him!
He bit me!
The entire collarbone was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to everyone in the water and told them to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hammel.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
It's not known what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it was not a shark species that posed a threat.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury's plans to strengthen its position on the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing beauty stores in the style of a general store, with specialist sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, although sales of household and fashion products are not matching, larger beauty retailers will be tested in 11 stores in the country and integrated into more stores next year if successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space previously allocated to TVs, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of the retailer Sainsbury's said that the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its make-up line, Boutique, which means that most of the products are aimed at vegans, a demand increasingly common among younger shoppers.
In addition, products from French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury's stores for testing purposes, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend to buy smaller quantities of food each day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of retailer Sainsbury's, said the outlets will increasingly look like convenience stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has included both Argos and Habitats products in hundreds of stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury's tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a disagreement over how to split the revenues of Boots stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of retailer Sainsbury's, said: "We've transformed the look of our retail stores with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to give you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us a great place to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract
The star of the TV show "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company has been compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would be retiring.
Holly Willoughby has generated the ire of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the show Dragons Den, by withdrawing at the last minute from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was outraged when one of television's most beloved personalities admitted on Tuesday, during a tense session at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow her to devote herself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have nearly doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated value of £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was giving up his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
Statement from a source: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was just before the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the host of the show This Morning, which is among the best-selling stars in the UK, could cause the company to lose millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible additional delay in the launch.
It can also represent the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business".
I was very tough, and then we fell in love.
He made fun of the criticism he will receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and about his so positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said imitating a newscaster 's voice .
I didn't take a step back.
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial Singapore meeting in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen an adequate response from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament efforts.
The Commission also noted that the US continued to issue sanctions to pressure the US to do so.
Trump had a more optimistic viewpoint in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well with North Korea", he said.
We were heading for war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I did act like that, instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped arena, it would be about 200 people", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a necessary condition for triggering international relief actions.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it's a bit of a difficult situation", Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia endures on a regular basis, it is incredible that the country continues to be ill-prepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very common on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued to that effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's precarious infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has generously allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will run for another election next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sectarians in Indonesia as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the winning goal and equalises the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 yards from the opposing team's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a kick in the direction of the goal.
The ball reached above the frame, heading towards the top right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the goal.
"I just had to try to get in the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to go as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, I just took the ball away.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue forward sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then turned in midfield and ran towards Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move into the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the carriage.
Hazard overcame the defence and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, as of Sunday morning.
More people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, was covered in debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to this matter to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I call on all persons who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who have recorded any useful footage using the onboard camera to contact us if they have information that is essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman from Birkenhead and that it was found on property.
This afternoon, several people who think they know the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they're trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed into the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would be a few hours before they were allowed in.
A police officer told one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene, a woman appeared in tears.
Repeat over and over again. It's so awful.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the perimeter and another was outside.
Several police officers were standing on the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to be affected by the "re-writing of history" controversy
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who is part of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.
A pig killed a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead after having an artery severed and covered in blood near a pig farm in the market of Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of the Morning Post in southern China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he had come with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a neighboring cottage was open.
He stated that in the pen was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The medical examiner confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were covered in blood and splattered", the cousin, whose surname is Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV cameras recorded Yuan entering the marketplace at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else while police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It seems Yuan's family and the authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years ago, because of a 300-pound pig, a man in Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
They're just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve, he said.
Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves into the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rainfall that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of 85 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, Sunday morning at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to reach the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression zone has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that will interact with the depression area will generate heavy rains in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly desert landslides.
Intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause the canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds in gusts and dust.
The approaching depression zone will bring torrential rains to areas along the southern California coast.
Rainfall of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the wet season.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona in the second half of Sunday and the first half of Monday, before the rain spreads further on Monday evening and Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will spread to the so-called four corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, the United States will experience intense temperature changes as the Arctic region gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are being observed across the central United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures reaching as high as 27 degrees in wide areas from the southern plains to portions of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could get to 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the press release by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting their regular Friday programming for a breaking news story: an agreement reached between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford testified before the grand jury that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh harassed her while he was drunk and that he tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he was 100% sure that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble contouring people watching from the office.
To put that into perspective, this audience is similar to a football game in the playoffs or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stood looking down for a few minutes while people argued with him, and it was all live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling us the truth?
She was told, "You have strength, while so many women are weak".
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast the vote in the Judiciary Committee live to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to review the charges against the nominee next week, which is what the Democrats' minority demand.
Flake was convinced, in large part, by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with the Coons and several senators afterwards.
Flake's election was a big one, and it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "political games" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which is accompanied by his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson attacked her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect tariffs on each other was "completely ridiculous".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting dead the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody, charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released footage of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department, and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest in question.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their diligence and their pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This thing worries me all the time", Wade said.
A volcano has thrown a column of ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to keep their distance from the volcano after activity erupted in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over 24 hours.
The center is monitoring more noises and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Fight between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, which gathered thousands of opposition protesters.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept at arm's length from the gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
The scuffle escalated later, with the police using their batons to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We don't forget, we don't forgive" while unionist protesters shouted "Long live Spain!"
14 people have received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region which wants to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although turnout was low, and those opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, leading to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year I had some of the best times of my life.
I watched my parents crying for joy that they could vote, but now we have nothing to do, he said.
Despite securing a vital but tight victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties have tried to maintain their lead this year, with many of the most prominent leaders either in self-exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"As a candidate in the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a Londonderry home several times.
The incident occurred Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and even the building.
It appears that at one point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga 's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston left Rangers without a replay, with Steven Gerrard reaching their second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain without a Premier League away win this season and face the Hearts leaders, being eight points behind them next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division down to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat, as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the cruel visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and tried to kick into the goal space, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after he slipped in to intercept the headed ball from Craig Halkett.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems for the visitors on free kicks.
And that was how the crucial gap came.
Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working to care for Menga, who kicked and scored from the center of the frame.
At that stage, the Rangers were dominating possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unmolested for the rest of the game.
This pattern of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Rangers' Allan McGregor, and Lithgow took a wide shot from another Livingston player.
Diagonal passes continued to come in the Livingston team's queue, but without success, and the two penalty requests - after Halkett crashed Glenn Middleton and after a heck - were not accepted.
"Fenominal game offered by Livingston"
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They have been excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and team have not changed at all since their return to the top flight, but credit must go to Holt for the way he has coached his team since taking over.
He had so many role models.
Captain Halkett was great, with a greatly organised defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they have performed well since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they only managed once to catch the opponents' goal free, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was in full swing on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, intended to mend ties between NATO allies.
They are unhappy because of issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him back into the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in a crash on Childers Street, where the driver fled the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in a brawl
Six prison officers were injured in a brawl at a high-security men's prison, a prison spokesman said.
On Sunday, a brawl broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30, and is ongoing.
Specialised officers were brought in to deal with the brawl, involving eight inmates, isolated in a wing.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "The assistance of specialised prison staff has been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after being injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules about who is responsible, who will be handed over to the police and could spend a longer period behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, riot police officers were called to the jail to deal with a very serious situation, where the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded by Hurricane Rosa.
A tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but it is quite likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory toward Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second half of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Weather Service announced in a tweet that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression status within about 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall ranging from 5 to 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities of between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest is facing drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing a drought of least severity, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still hurricane-force Sunday morning, with winds of up to 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and therefore diminish.
It is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high risk of flooding.
Through hailstorms of 8 to 10 cm from Baja California to northwest Sonora are expected, and may reach 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north into Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or its remnants is extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert of the southwest United States", a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce flash floods, which will endanger people's lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday, at approximately 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Officers asked citizens who might have material on their mobile phones to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the "displeasure and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh faced the "displeasure and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that she sexually harassed her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing regarding her claim.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day.
"A confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the finest legal minds of this generation", he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but, in a way, I'm running, he said.
For this reason, I express my positive opinion about the candidates I consider to be the most outstanding.
Trump has argued that the Democrats are on a mission to resist and obstruct.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, number rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by huge waves that hit beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a beach festival in Palu City when six-meter waves hit the beach at dusk, sweeping people away and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still watching their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, becoming victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami brought cars, logs, houses, and everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled offshore at 500 miles per hour before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Photos released by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the World War II Hiroshima atomic bomb.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, probably intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, the official added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 kilometers north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were "completely disrupted, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building frantically shouting tsunami warnings to people on the adjacent street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basic items.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they passed devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: "They told me they saw many houses destroyed".
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups have started disaster relief operations, some people complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's another disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster", we can start international relief, but nothing has been announced yet.
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and families of the missing were hoping that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a ditch.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding team coach, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliders.
Other people held captive at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"Given my experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon told how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors attending the beach festival.
But right in front of his messages was just a gray steak, not two blue steaks.
I think that means the messages weren't transmitted, he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole the sum of $26,750 from a Brink employee who was powering an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had stolen an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to move more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While it was occupied, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be carried.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity is requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his stage name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to Ye.
He made the announcement on Saturday on Twitter: "the individual officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and is using that title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
He is coming on the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for reasons of emotional nature", the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means tu", West said earlier this year in a discussion about the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is about us.
It all started with Kanye, which means the unique, and it ended with Ye, which is a reflection of our good, bad, fuzzy and whole.
The album is more of a reflection on what we are as people.
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs has had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with a crayon, sometimes without, and in capital letters.
The president of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and user who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government made announcements about AI, even though there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the US.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be the world's leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are way behind the U.S. and that we're looking for the next breakthrough on AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the American gamer Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's putting the wheels in the academy's heads, it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired outstanding college graduates to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
"I think they should automatically offer visas to PhD students in AI", he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides financial support to individuals in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Selection Committee.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Also, at this point, the NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes to United States law aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether they want the country's name changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would settle a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had cast doubt on voter turnout, with the 50% threshold needed to validate the referendum likely to be missed.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, must pay to be accepted into entities like the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, quite a few MPs have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of eligible voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, as well as their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, which will allow it to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, like China and Russia and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a result in favor of changing the name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of eligible voters will participate in the referendum, below the required number of participants.
According to another poll, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for change.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took office in May last year.
Video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manages to get through the whole Brighton defence and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to get past the Brighton defense and get a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero had an incredibly easy time scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly through the three defensive players at Brighton, before reaching the free-throw line.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to get past one defender, and then overtook several opposing players at the edge of Brighton's team's carriage.
Then he made a left-handed pass, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a kick to the right of the goal.
Aguero is having some leg problems, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
I talked to him and we agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point.
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial lead for the Blues in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on Brighton's team territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a pass on the left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it towards the goal.
The Blues forward hit the ball into the net just before he headed off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least one unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to hold on to their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?
The national team has yet to announce the player who will open Sunday's match, but according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the opening hitter with the No. 34, had a warm-up session Thursday and will pitch in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington center fielder is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 and 2/3 innings this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation with the Supreme Court's decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
All our effort is on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, not I'm running, but I'm actually running, so I try very hard to support good candidates", he said.
Trump continued: "Look at this terrible, radical group of Democrats, look at what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take power again by using whatever means necessary, you can see their evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
He also said that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see that in the last four days", he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and mean, cowardly and lying".
He was referring to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was heavily booed by the public.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
- There you go.
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the censure motion in my case.
After all, I am just one of the Labour Members of Parliament who have been told they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, on which neither Jeremy nor the previous leaders had a common view.
The communication for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting stated that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings have been like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take place in this way, and the promise of a 'better, softer' political environment has long been forgotten, if it has ever been honoured.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things started to get this way when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I shared a common vision on politics started to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things that I would not have agreed with before, including national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there's a wave of abuse on the de-socialising networks demanding my removal from the party, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who's facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about me tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination that my colleagues show when faced with sexual or racist abuse, but they maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with each censure motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have been telling me for the last two years to put my head down, not be so vocal, and everything will be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence of the Thatcher government had led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for better public services for those who needed them most, as a local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the issues I disagree with regarding the current leadership are unclear to them.
To the people who supported Friday's motion, I can only say that as the country heads towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their willingness to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not to the Momentum group in Nottingham, but to the citizens, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to represent you, and I promise you that no threat of expulsion or political opportunism will stop me from making decisions that I consider to be in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr football team tops the table
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's highly interactive Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was all about their better defense, as well as making the most of the opportunities that came their way, which helped the home team and pleased coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been put through a lot of tests in our matches up to this point and we continue to be unbeatable, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The credit goes to Ayr, they took chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a lead, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unconverted attempt.
Climo scored a penalty for Ayr and, just halfway through the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half off well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the pitch with the targa, and since the restart of the game Ayr has been unleashed via the player's Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the hosts recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for playing Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving Ayr the advantage.
Climo turned the attempt around, as he did again near the restart of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a box kick and sent the Gregor Henry extreme into depth for the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of the sitcom Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems poised to move into the hospitality industry after he's been named CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the beloved BBC show, writing its script and starring alongside his long-time partner, comedian Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next series, the ninth, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the "developing restaurant industry".
The sea is ours: Bolivia island hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling a naval base full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings carry the blue flag, like the ocean.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right".
We have to get her back.
Across Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive  as is the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, it is looking forward to the outcome with a positive vision", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is forced to negotiate a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president  who faces a controversial re-election fight next year  also has much to gain from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that very little would change if it did.
The UN body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleadings were heard indicates that this case "wasn't complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has Bolivia not had the success of the cause, but it's possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most beloved presidents - used the maritime issue as political prop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must move past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, has said that his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to honor the promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an unrealistic view that continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would ever cause the northern territory to give in.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking meaningful disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who don't believe that Pyongyang has any serious intentions of giving up the arsenal that the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris showcases the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you're looking for hats to expand your collection or to completely protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked attendees at Paris Fashion Week by launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The unpractical hats took over Instagram this summer, and fashion designers sent eye-catching creations onto the podium.
The standout piece of Valentino's creation was an extravagant beige hat with a large feather-like bore into which the models' heads sank.
Other oversized accessories have included beaded watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, rather than haute couture.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving kit, with an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt this style of clothing, with oversized garments, you're in luck.
Stylists predict a return of the giant bonnet in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats are back after the "La Bomba" hat, the straw hat with a wide brim, seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the unpractical hat that has appeared on all social networks has caused another oversized creation to appear on the podium, namely the straw bag for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathing suit wearing it.
The orange shelf bag, with shelf fringes and a white leather handle, was the signature piece of Jacquemus' 2019 spring-summer collection at La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer, as the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for secondary and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust people in other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we see that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Now foreign languages as a subject are held in the same way as STEM subjects in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that of the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming imperative in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a skill throughout their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That's why investing in foreign language learning is important for today's children.
Having more languages, especially in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and empower children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
There is no denying at this moment, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play remains to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
The time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins this evening a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in places where voters favor him, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat temporarily suspended, Trump wants to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's election rally in West Virginia tonight and where can I watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election rally in West Virginia online via the live YouTube stream below.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week so the FBI can investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
Trump's campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election by a margin of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican nominee for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him in the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for the singles events that start on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it's possible that Saturday afternoon's foursome was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-shifting pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
"We were six points ahead, now we're just four points behind, so we're relying on this drop for a little bit of motivation", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to turn in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to cheer, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and have each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls into the green with lethal precision, setting an example for his teammates.
Those celebratory guttural cries became louder as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point to tie the score in the fourth game after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
His winning shot at 15 was celebrated with a similar howl, a howl that makes you think the American team still has a shot.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game", Spieth says.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe have won four out of four matches and it seems they can't fail.
Moliwood was the only pair that didn't need any extra shots on Saturday afternoon, but that's true for Saturday morning, and Friday afternoon, and even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday.
Preferably both at the same time, in different holes.
Talks about the glory of Europeans remain premature, for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs, when he paired with Alex Noren.
An extra shot and two doubles on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit so deep they were not even close to coming out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and foursome trials are fascinating and worth watching closely because of the interactions between pairs, the given and ungiven tips, and the way a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, something that some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after finishing Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins against a hesitant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The USA opposed a more serious resistance in the foursome, where they won two matches but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 straight games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and along with the Molinari, a pair nicknamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points from the opening four matches in all Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they held each other up superbly to defeat the dispirited Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in both Saturday matches, has had occasional flashes of genius, but so far has lost 19 of 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning's fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three, 2-1 in the foursome.
Europe did not have a smooth ride on this pleasant and cool day southwest of Paris, however.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time major champion, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win 2-1 a match against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the singles, although, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need a draw.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is no chance of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the global council that North Korea had implemented "significant measures to prove its good faith" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the US", he said.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we can't unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar objections to Washington's resistance to a "stepped" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because he did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a premier summit between a sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress towards a "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump offered assurances on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not responded to requests for relief from the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even objects to the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don't know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, in the last five months, adding: If the denuclearization issue had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this impasse.
Even in these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target US territory with missiles from North Korea after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage in initiating the disarmament process, but said the work is just beginning and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned timeframe for this, adding: It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months.
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the corridors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go over well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said there had been progress, but only hours later, North Korea denounced him for making "gangster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are doing a class on how to get enough rest.
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing "macho" culture that makes them undergo "all-night", high-caffeine-fueled learning sessions.
One scientist found that students at the world's most prestigious universities often do not even master the basics of how they should care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
And finally, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did you tell me this until now, last year?"
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, explains the key concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a picture of a dorm room, and students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers, and books to be told what the effects of caffeine and light are, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a sleep schedule.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
We know we can't instantly change student behavior.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know, what the health effects of smoking are", Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that makes students proud to have studied all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Good quality, adequate sleep should be a student's secret weapon for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even for avoiding weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe the body is hungry, which makes students feel like they're constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling at this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to program an alarm to know when it was time to go to bed, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb their circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's team out
Rangers suffer another case of on-the-go depression as Dolly Menga's shot sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first away win since their 4-1 win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side managed to give Gerrard his second 18-game defeat as manager, putting Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the authoritative leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' uninspired players never seemed able to match.
Rangers thus fell to sixth position in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third, behind Hibernian, by a single goal.
And the Rangers could face other problems, too, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, apparently, thrown off the field by the visiting team's fans.
Gerrard replaced eight players from the lot that won easily against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a draw with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained batch smashed their opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, the Livingstons used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes into the game, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman into the goal defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent it over the bar.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed more hopeful than confident in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although the 34th minute goal by Livingstone did not follow the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if only for the effort put in.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep focus on Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga, who finished with a single stroke.
Gerrard acted at halftime, when he traded Ryan Kent for Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately, as the extreme centered Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the bullpen to block him.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into the exact same type of game he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centre-forward.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' shot, then Lithgow sent his head over the goal with the corner kick.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers reserve, called for a penalty late in the game when he hit Jacobs but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and counting continues...), is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science ever since, the Geiger counter has become essential for pop culture as well, as happened in the film The Bells of San Coronado (1950), which starred Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboys with improbable scientific leanings:
What is that?
It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive atoms emitted in the minerals.
Evans: Yeah, there's a lot of punching going on!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can detect a protein common to many cancers and then they're re-injected.
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can detect a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine".
HER2 determines the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells, has worked for treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribes in support of Trump, while wearing a MAGA hat, after the SNL appearance.
It didn't turn out too well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wild performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intends to run in the 2020 election.
After performing a third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed a speech against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
A lot of times when I talk to a white person, they ask me, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star poked fun at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's diatribe was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to screw with West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems backstage because of his hat.
They tried to intimidate me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat".
I was assaulted!
I was also told that I had gone very low, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how low I've gone?" and then he said, "I'm going to grab my Superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love.
His comments drew public outcry at least twice, and the SNL crew members appeared embarrassed, Variety reported; one member of the team told the publication: "There was complete silence in the studio".
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for lead singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when he performed "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR FACTING THE GLOAT".
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was simply himself and that's great.
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their charter) who I believe embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and of course the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast's east end on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
Defence counsel is due at Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that portraying these roles on screen makes boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that she felt something had gone wrong and wondered how to deal with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones cast member Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he is "very determined" to talk about the issue.
"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about this now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we face now?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is learned?
What do young boys learn on TV and on the street that makes them believe they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he admitted that he will not be appearing in any series based on Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, saying that he is done with the battlefields and the horses.
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's play True West, which depicts the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I made this show, so it secured my family's future and my life from now on", Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year-on-year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widely considered to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data to Republican senators, speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Rep. Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations are being made by analysts and "extreme right" websites.
"Lies, lies and other miserable lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information included the personal addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and provided the information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false, an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These baseless accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
They must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to be calm and quiet".
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members".
Johnny English hits again: a flawless parody of spy movies, starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit-related meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the parody series of action films starring Johnny English, a series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Could this sickening satire of how we're weird become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the staring eyes and the rubber face, has been renewed for a second license to screw everything up.
He is, of course, the rambunctious secret agent who, despite his pretensions to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of the kind that contributed a single note to the theme music of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This latest J.E. adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet gently.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because "serious" films like those in the 007 series or Mission: Impossible confidently provide comedic moments as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be more for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's wild adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise has always been that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret UK spy web and revealed the identities of the British undercover agents, much to the desperation of the service agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a pompous and besieged prime minister, who is already suffering a severe crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn't give her a chance to shine.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate a reserve agent.
This is Johnny English's own nephew, now working as a teacher in an upper-class school, but also teaching classes on how to be an undercover agent.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then is reunited with his longtime partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and valuable character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin of the mess in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing off against the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of bachelor adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak aboard Volta's luxury yacht, then English unleashes anarchy in its purest form when they try to use a set of VR glasses to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's home.
This last scene is very ambitious, but as cute and colorful as the film is, it looks like a children's television production.
A rather mediocre film.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role that's commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies that they plan for British people to work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, whereby the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems the party wants the CEOs to take advantage of the possible savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but would not change their pay.
Sources say the idea would "contract" with the party's economic program, which wants to tip the balance in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source in the Labour leadership told The Sunday Times: "An announcement on a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a fitting aspiration in the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party's overall strategy on industry.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day work week was one of the promises of the Green Party in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and is not taken into account by the party.
The Lord Chancellor of the shadow cabinet, John McDonnell, took the opportunity of last week's Labour conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell has stated that he is determined to take back power from the faceless CEOs and the profiteers of the utility companies.
The Lord Chancellor's plans in the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government could charge deductions for found offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to company boards and to create ownership funds to sell 10% of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to around £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on 60 Minutes whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation would change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded to drop their support for him because of the FBI findings.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I said that at the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came out and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was determined, prompt, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, though, seems to be in stone.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would take some explosive charges", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denies the allegations", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she named confirmed the report.
And that was 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it managed to do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event featuring an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to see artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls, or other significant things that help raise awareness of the goal of ending global poverty.
But what success has the Global Citizen Festival had with only 12 years to go?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to get them to take action, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism, a concept that refers to people feeling like they've accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million shares have been registered since 2011 by its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, for which at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries committed to helping children grow to their full potential, which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like yourself, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced it would fund The Power of Nutrition, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: What makes you think you can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that have gone before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval forces for a "blockade" to hamper Russia's energy exports, says Home Secretary
Washington may, if necessary, call on naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's engagement in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to broker the sale of energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is basically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels", he said, saying about Russia that he "knows one trick" because of the economy's dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said that the fierce US opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we see things the same way: energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Aleksandr Novak, Russia's energy minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy secretary, in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third country interfering in our energy issues", said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she should "think seriously" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During the meeting at the Holyoke, Massachusetts city hall, Warren confirmed that he was considering a run.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that takes a strong woman", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll seriously consider running for president.
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he "has steered the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that even a majority of Warren's voters don't think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate of his and 48% are against.
Other well-known names of Democrats who could run in 2020 are Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks about the PTSD that she suffers from Track Palin, at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
"The things my own son is going through after he came back... I can understand the suffering of other families who are feeling the ramifications of PTSD and the aftermath of the wounds our soldiers are returning with", he told an audience gathered at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "come back a little different, tougher, come back wondering if there's any respect for what they and their soldiers in the Army and Air Force, and all the other members of the military, have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence act, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus curiae petition Friday in Washington to support a challenge to the asylum-seeker policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and his violent gang-member sons abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Council on Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle", the amicus curiae request states.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the petition that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General, ordered in June immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a social group or because of political opinion", Sessions said on June 11 when he announced the policy.
The role of the asylum was never to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll has doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more dire.
"The situation seems very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is caring for her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulance's bringing bodies in all the time.
Drinking water is inadequate.
Residents began returning to their destroyed homes and organizing their flooded property, trying to salvage whatever could be salvaged.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to her spine and shoulder, are resting outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to the continuous strong aftershocks.
He has tears in his eyes as he recalls how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife when she screamed for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of abusing propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's additional payment to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run commercials promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war, involving waves of tariff increases on imports.
The tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China is "continuing this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading propaganda by running an ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is breaking the tradition of free speech and a free press so cherished in America", writes Branstad.
"In contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will see no real reflection of the divergent opinions Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that one of the major newspapers in China refused to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections because of the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual abuse allegations, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most of the Republicans who have publicly discussed it plan to continue the vote.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news website.
People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, aged 18 to 29, who, although they dislike the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the sexual abuse allegations brought against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash might follow if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This has become a nuisance for Republicans", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be confirmed, but how the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic election support group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided as to which side they should believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies: slightly more seem to believe the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe it is likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said they strongly believe or believe it is likely that Kavanaugh's testimony was true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as by at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her while she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data archives or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, schedules, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What's unique about this online personal data repository is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this 'personal data consolidation'.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute with the right resources, processes and expertise, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely upended all at once.
We don't ask their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the cleric who won the Victory Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only Anglican clergyman to win a Victoria Cross medal as a combatant in World War I has been commemorated in his home town after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he was being awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "beautifully symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the event that won his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through a very thick fog and under intense artillery and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with fantastic bravery, cleared the way for the soldiers, then single-handedly attacked an artillery nest and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I'll never be able to match, but it makes me feel humbled".
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to play a role in the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he gets from a lot of people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig cartoons instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, only to miss the main event.
The schedule for the San Jose event contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, UK viewers were stunned when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all satisfied, for they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One fan described the move to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of bad joke".
"Government regulations say this content is not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to kids programs", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
The Peppa Pig, yeah.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they will schedule their events in such a way that they can be watched by spectators in the UK.
"When I think about resumes, I think we could probably work it out", Coker said.
But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do it until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't that. It was a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to be five fights instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to give the fans more, and we went over the line.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said that it wasn't until he got to school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he speaks about the rights of gay people to give others "hope".
The athlete also said that when he became a father, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that as a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, "So far, these feelings of inferiority and feeling different have been the real things that have given me the strength and resilience to achieve success".
He wanted to prove he was somebody, he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of an appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live free, without consequences, and because he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was "taken by surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the Academy Award-winning filmmaker last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age - he competed in his first Olympics when he was only 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone your age who's gone through the same good and bad times", he said.
The two became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed his whole outlook.
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in nothing more than winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to know was if they had received tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be able to be first, Dad", he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life, to jump in front of the spectators of my country at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired him in the music he chose, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was moved to the bench Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back to good form to make this an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome trials.
Instead of being the center of the action, as she often was for the U.S. team, the five-time major-league winner split her day between cheering for teammates and practicing her shots, hoping to right what she had done wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the best drives, even in the prime of his career, so he's not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough zones often penalize incorrect shots.
And if the field isn't a big enough challenge, in Sunday's ninth match Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the entry into the 12 games of the series, who must start strong at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said otherwise anyway.
"He completely understood the role he had today, he patted me on the shoulder, he hugged me and he told me he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I probably never imagined he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but this is what happened and this is how I thought we should proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never rose to the level of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with the players, he's a great guy in the team locker room", he explained.
I think the young players have fun playing with him, it was fun to watch them do that during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about the game.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the considerable lead held before the first day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to beat them by a minimum margin of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win", said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, and now lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and my team that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's get out there and make it perfect.
The game is not over until the points are passed on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, that must remain the goal.
We've always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know what's waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world.
Pleased with the way his players handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: "I'm not quick to jump to conclusions.
Tomorrow is a whole different situation.
Tomorrow is the individual performance, and this is different.
It's great to be on the court with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, that's when you're tested to the limit, as a golfer.
That's the message you have to send to the players, that they have to be at their best tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as best they can.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the opposing team captain, hopes his players will play better in the single-elimination than they did with their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of such comebacks on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe achieved the 'miracle at Medina'.
"I remember every word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to cheer his players up before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow and we'd like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
We've created the right batch and we've sorted the players as we want, you know, we're trying to create a little bit of magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the programme.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think they cover all the subjects", Bjorn said of the batch for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, delayed again
Germany's newest naval frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but that won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was to be commissioned into the navy in 2014, but problems after delivery have hampered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and stealth technologies, which ensure a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to leave for two-year missions without returning to their home port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to enhance Germany's naval strength, will already be obsolete before they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but German media have cited a number of "critical software and hardware flaws" that would have rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the crews on older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship proved to be much too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, the cost of the whole project, including that of training the crew, became a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), from the original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was running out of ships that could be sent on missions.
The official said that the problem has grown steadily over time, as old vessels have been taken out of service without being replaced with new ones.
It regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had entered service with the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands is trying to uncover how bats use their environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behaviour of these novel flying mammals and will help future conservation efforts.
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will look at common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys, using hand-held detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and which species make certain sounds.
A habitat map and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scale-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and what is the best way to maintain forest grasslands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their nests, as well as habitat loss.
And wind turbines and street lighting are risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts who periodically conduct surveys, check nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species are found.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here at Threave, the area is wonderful for bats", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to breed.
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work on property, as the mere accidental destruction of a mother's nest could kill up to 400 females and young, which could destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue magazine in Germany
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the allegations against him are fake news and that some people want to advertise using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said it was "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in front of the camera.
They want to advertise using my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions about his private life", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for moral damages equivalent to an amount appropriate to the gravity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was a "99% good boy" and that he was betrayed by that "1%".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims she contacted the police and that the pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and was worried that "she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain would forever regret losing its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini is made for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the fix on time principle': for custom-made cars, parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which, according to industrialists, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success we have but to take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not specify how long it would have to stop production, but warned that the increased prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the factory in the long term and would eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said members are increasingly worried: Experience has taught me that once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have created a clear and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed" another week as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Rumors about Trump possibly firing the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, have been circulating in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump requested a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, which again delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It hasn't been set yet, it could be this week or it could be postponed by a week, given all the other things that are going on at the Supreme Court right now".
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.
Some reporters would dispute this statement: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in briefings was not due to antipathy towards TV reporters, who enjoy being on the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they enjoy being on the show".
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president attends more Q&A sessions than all previous presidents", she said, adding without citing any evidence: "We have looked at the figures".
"There will be briefings", Sanders said, "but I think it's much better if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me".
We try to do this most of the time, and you could see that we've done this many times in the last few weeks, and the talks with the president of the United States will replace the press briefings when he's available.
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
His exclusive press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening by making a sudden, sometimes bizarre, appearance to a gathering of reporters.
A Health Secretary of State addresses a letter to EU staff at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State wrote to EU staff working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to stay on after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as there are less than six months to go before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for permanent residence for EU citizens working in the decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government has increasingly begun to prepare for a different scenario as well, where there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday in the game his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the hit occurred shortly before halftime.
"It got to the line of fire and it just collapsed", Reed said.
Abercrombie was given an oxygen mask by the physical trainers and medical staff on the line, before being placed on a bench and transported off the field for a thorough evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to score five total touchdowns before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 touchdowns for the entire season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless, under new Conservative Party plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people to the vote.
The stamp duty will be applied to persons who are not taxpayers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of court stamp duty on property purchases in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income individuals.
The higher stamp duty will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and duties in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the high levels of two years ago for second-home and rent-purchased properties, could amount to 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring in a surplus of up to £120 million per year.
Around 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, leading to rising prices and making it difficult for those looking to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the court stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
It accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by buying land without using it and called on Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable housing in order to tackle the UK's 'housing problem'.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and a halt to unjustified evictions.
It also wants to give councils more power in terms of building new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents, as well as companies based abroad, should be able to buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and living in shoddy conditions is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the Scotland national team".
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland football team, said that his ultimate goal is to become, at some point, manager of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-Eastern club, who are currently in 3rd place in the Premier League, three points behind the top-flight.
He moved to the team at the Stadium of Light this summer after they managed to get St Mirren back into the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
I made the B national team and that's it, Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland at Hampden with my dad and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only get this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic has said he has no emotions about being the successor to such revered names and at such a major club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question, "Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities at this club allow it to be in the Premier League", he said.
It's not easy to get it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to help the club get back into the Premier League.
Ross has just three years' experience in management, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to recover after being relegated to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship the following season.
Ross has stated that he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a defining moment", he said of taking over the leadership of the Alloa club.
I really thought I was more suited to the manager role than the player.
It may sound strange, because I had a good time, I was winning well and I had a few good moments.
But it's hard being a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel like it's the right role for me.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I can do that, I feel like it's the best fit for me in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday, September 30th, between 12:00 and 13:00 on Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
The ideal time to drink a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a poll.
This summer's heat wave has led to an increase in pub revenues in the UK, but putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars recorded a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, representative of the business consultancy CGA who carried out the survey, said: The steady heat and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation contributed to a pattern in July similar to the previous month, when pubs registered up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse run.
The number of customers down by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June fell further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
Food-serving restaurants also experienced heat losses, but not as great as restaurants.
It seems people have been out in town just to consume drinks.
Beverage sales at all bars and pubs rose by 6.6% this month, and food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, representative of RSM, a company providing services to the hospitality industry, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to lose, although a decline in sales of 4.8% year on year will add to the current cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.
The total sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, increased by 2,7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly opened locations.
The company that monitors pub, bar and restaurant sales in the UK, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined profit of over £9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents
According to one survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta accounts
The news has raised fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, set up a social networking account and keep it hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts referring to the photo-sharing platform Instagram.
The news has raised fears about the sexual content.
20% of students said they have a main and clean account that they show to their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, noticed a teenager's post asking to be "raped".
According to research by the UK company Digital Awareness and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), 40% of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers do not have access to.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletes' Commission.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the chairman, described the change as a great opportunity for decision-makers in sport to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit significantly from his inclusion on the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle also said: 'I am delighted to be able to represent the athletes and hope to make a real contribution and help the way sports are run in Scotland.'
The American athlete, who won the 200 and 400 metres events at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to four Olympic gold medals, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, has been left disabled after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a titanic job, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
A breast pump ad comparing women to cows divides online public opinion
A breast pump company has caused a split in public opinion online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that aims to be the world's first silent, portable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has launched a wry ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a cow barn full of hay to a song that includes lines like, "Yes, I suck, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't my breasts, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "I pump, pump, breastfeed the babies, pump, pump, milk the girls".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of whom said it exposes the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen within days of birth, one person wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/mother)
Another person commented: "It's understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "A highly inappropriate advertisement".
Other people defended the ad, one person claiming that he thought it was a "hilarious" ad.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pomp even made me feel like a vacuum.
The commercial is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant, one person wrote.
Another person commented: It's a funny ad targeting mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like vacuums.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like vacuums.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies in their arms, and even go out on the town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it takes to use a breast pump and the challenges of doing so, and to present, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were smuggled into a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made the process of placing children with sponsors more difficult.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear that they will jeopardize their stay in the country if they request to adopt children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, would have to register their fingerprints and that their details would be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80% of the people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are living in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we'll continue to search for the individuals, Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing children into the system, the authorities introduced new rules that require children to appear in court one month after detention, not 60 days as the previous standard required, according to shelter workers.
Many will plead the case via video call, rather than in person before an immigration judge, to claim legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more they may become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are heightened at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs that a child is having problems are not noticed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause them the trauma that many of them already suffer from.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish military forces withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the interim Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the situation will be handled appropriately.
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He also stated that Damascus will continue this "sacred struggle" until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.
In Syria, there are approximately 2,000 US military troops, mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were favourable for their return and accused "several Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: 'We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return'.
 Political influence is being brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to prevent a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a clear "time limit" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra Front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and will be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to 'revising the articles of the current constitution' and issued a warning about interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
If we were to go by this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless impeachment or scandals end his presidency sooner, which a large portion of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In that case, it would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!
So far, it seems the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has doubled at CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, prime-time viewership of Fox News averages 2.4 million, down from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has a record audience of 3.5 million on prime-time nights.
"This is a subject that appeals to the public because we can't understand it", said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC's drama series "The Presidents' Reserves", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, this action in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the state of the global economy.
Changing posts is a luxury only the privileged can afford.
However, you're not just an informed citizen when you get to the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (an opulent item of clothing, according to The Washington Post) and the implications of actress Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Trump's anatomical parts.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A lot of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show and feeding you with topics every night", said Brent Montgomery, executive director of media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "The Bail Bond", about the constantly shifting distribution and daily upheavals caused by Trump (the launch of a certain NFL thing, the praise for Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, because you'll feel like you're left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the north shore of the island of Kauai, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing some weird shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, resulting in two incumbents running for the same office, it is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
So the new suburb of Pittsburg district brought in Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which overlaps significantly with the state's 17th.
The election maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating the district boundaries in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th electoral district triggered a competition in campaign finance between the major party funding bodies, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For over a decade, the office had been held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its deal with China, but then dropped it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following recent "decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving any new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they remained anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that might happen is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which there is now strong evidence of made public.
Mueller is also reportedly focusing his investigation on investigating the existence of a plot between the Trump campaign and Russia in relation to the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due accountability within the body, even as he prepares to appear before voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible scenarios, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's downfall is inevitable, as is true for his European counterparts.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the West opposed it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and so missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few of these critical moments right now.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein has stated that the Times' report is incorrect.
What will we do if the new investigation requested by the FBI regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put it in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this to their advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, considering Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we'd get a good result and we earned a point.
We probably could have scored in the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
Thursday will be another big night for Europe.
With a little luck we'll get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they had a good result in the last game they played, but with the support of the fans, we'll definitely feel even more motivated and we'll have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, considering my injuries and the changes at the club, but things are better at the moment.
The team is good and the guys really like being here; the training is going well too.
Let's hope we persevere, that we put the past behind us and that we get good results.
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people surveyed by Nationwide said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of them said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't initiate the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not make your wishes known early.
Work with the counsellor and the family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial adviser: the financial adviser can also be of real help in paying these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a cash-based mixed life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses, or you can insure your own well-being  as far as you have the money.
Get your legal documents ready: come to the legal problems.
Get empowered to make medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and to ensure that the professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also consider making a power of attorney on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Remember the little details: Imagine that an elderly parent of yours has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not just the financial part. Can you tell me who the doctors are who are dealing with this?" asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Write a plan for all of these things.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle as he walked home after a night on the town.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which occurred at 2:30 a.m., as "random shootings".
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening, and police have called witnesses to testify.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster management authorities were unable to obtain any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu City, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coastline of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region that lies under a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fish farming and agriculture are the core of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala Regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami as high as 10 meters (33 feet) high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: several powerful earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the death of over 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is being held on a $500 bail-free bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded 100% innocent when asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of this.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in a domestic violence complaint and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder he suffers from after serving in the military forces in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and telecommunications networks are damaged and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off the coast of Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want the death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It appears that Saipov, 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its route in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both defendants could face the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "hideous, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek national, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
Also, according to the police, he asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to apply the death penalty.
A Conservative MP argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise the civilian army during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, following a statement by Theresa May's MP suggesting he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have left by now if Farage had been Secretary of State for the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces in terms of the highly divided camps has been accentuated by Conservative Party members joining another anti-Exit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to make sure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, works properly, facing attacks from those who want to leave the European Union, those who want to stay in it, and from the European Union itself.
Allies have stressed that she will continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her offer and Chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to give up the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had run things, we wouldn't be in the European Union", he said.
The Conservative MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan".
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he stated: We did not fight in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone denied suggestions of changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union.
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party who supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither do our activists who take to the streets and support us in the first place in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message aimed at Theresa May, she added: Prime Ministers who keep their office are those who keep their promises.
At the rally, Nigel Farage said that politicians must be put in a position to "feel the pressure" if they are about to back down from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilising the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists held up banners saying 'The Conservative Party is against Brexit' after the group's launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
'These are the people who are telling us they can deploy IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the digitisation of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland', he added.
It's a hoax.
Brexit is not beneficial, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a Republican member of the House of Representatives who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might defeat Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with voting citizens using the mayor's format since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our badly damaged government, and that included having a woman at the head of it.
A suspect has been arrested in the death of LSU player Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference ET at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, to being in possession of a weapon, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-4 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, starting 10 times last season and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team would play a crucial role in the race.
On the lead lap, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and left Hamilton at the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the pits one lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior clear after making a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row of the chariot and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, on the very day he turned 21.
He then held the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to take fourth place.
He finally stopped at the box on lap 44, but could not increase the pace in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
Valtteri did an outstanding job all weekend and behaved like a true gentleman, letting me go ahead.
And the team did an excellent job to get the win over Ferrari and to achieve this double", said Hamilton.
Terrible body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not facilitate the leak of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "bad, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and immoral and lying", he said.
When you see that they published and leaked information and then say they didn't do it.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When I asked Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the leak?
Do you remember her answer? She said, "Um... here we go".
I mean, no.
I didn't do that.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do that? No, we didn't, he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "leaked" in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred from her office.
"I did not conceal the allegations against Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the leak of her report", Feinstein told the commission, according to the Hill newspaper.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and that's exactly what I did.
But her denial didn't seem to go down well with the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "To be honest, it was terrible body language".
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the most horrible body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using the charges to further their own ends.
They are determined to seize power in any way possible.
Look at the evil, the immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to get power and control", the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Stars of Dundee paid for Friday's loss in the Elite League, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday's 5-3 draw in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard tied the score for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured them the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who had recovered from a 2-1 win over Dundee on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance was triggered in the fourth minute, 3:35, by a pass from Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford's decisive pass to Beauvillier doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the home team back into play in the 13th minute, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score for a draw in the 15th minute, 16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first period when he scored his second goal late in the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again tied the score with an impressive goal in the 27th minute.
Later in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus securing the team's rise to 5th place in the standings by the mid-last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be hosting Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Several powerful aftershocks have occurred in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of Palu town.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the shaking control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the air traffic control tower when he noticed it was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia's air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter has to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are saddened by this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe the number will increase as many victims are still under the rubble and we have not had access to many of them", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves as high as six meters devastated Palu city, with a mass funeral to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is bringing in victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the convenience stores are being robbed.
Jan Gelfand, the director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to provide aid to survivors, but we don't know what they will find on the ground.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?, announced CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by the Lombok earthquake, which left more than 550 dead.
Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now declared one person missing, after previously saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also mentioned that she is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane missed the runway and landed in a lagoon near it.
Some witnesses believe the plane went over the end of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes stated that the plane had come within a very short distance of the ground.
"It's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the rim, and reached the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working nearby to renovate a landing strip jumped in to help, using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore before the plane sank 100 feet (30 m) underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of these have involved an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the U.S. Attorney's Office concluded its plea in favor of a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used cell phone recordings to piece together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and those of his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from multiple cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called to the witness box and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he was lying because my van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide by the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is conscious hip-hop?
A trio of hip-hop musicians want to change the negative way this genre is viewed with songs with positive messages.
Bristol-based band The High Breed argue that hip-hop has stopped conveying political messages and addressing social issues as it did originally.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
There has been a recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after she received a racist text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied being racist, claiming that she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
Another person of color, Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the mistake, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, had not performed her duties properly and that she had expected to receive a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now she is suing the couple for severance pay and demanding $350 a day for six months, during which time she was supposed to live with them and carry on her business, despite the fact that this was done without a contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do these things", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the claims of being racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn?
Let's be serious about this.
Considering the trial an act of "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife would give birth in two months and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
Do you really want to get revenge on a person in such circumstances?
You don't do that, the investment banker added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they demonstrated.
The editors of Paddington's story feared that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said the following about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success.
She also said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was a "bitter-sweet" one after he died last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had a low-key pride in the success he later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to brag", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you're proud of him, even though it's not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his own creation, based on his own imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad calls frequently to tell me that he is very serious and that he does not think he will survive", said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad telling me she's gonna die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood was starting to diminish and it was leaving her body.
He had died a short time ago and his organs were starting to fail.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was happening.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the death of his daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what he was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I kept my head down and tears would flow.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Two grieving women post messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them motivational and including phone numbers people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a dazzling smile.
Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changed your mood.
However, he quit his job before he died, because he had come to a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking you're gonna have a domino effect".
It created messaging to tell people that they could call someone or that they could talk to someone, even a friend.
Come out, you need to talk to someone.
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' longtime friend, lost her 15-year-old life partner Mark shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he wasn't feeling well or that he was depressed", she said.
A few days before Christmas, I noticed a change in his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents and he didn't even look them in the eye.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get over it: It caused immense pain within the family.
We are devastated.
But we have to go on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI investigates his actions.
"I thought if we could get something similar to what he was asking for, a limited time and small scale investigation, we might have a little bit of unity", Jeff Flake said Saturday, adding that he fears the commission is about to disintegrate amid a partisan gridlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the time factor.
With only five weeks to go until the November 6 election - if, as predicted, the Republicans do poorly, their attempts to place the man they want as the winner of the election for the highest court in the land will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept making calls to senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There's a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make the difference in a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives is declining under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said that last year about 1,127 people fled the country, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged to those who illegally transport people across the border.
The Pyongyang official has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Officials in Seoul say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a series of talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in broad terms, to work together for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. sanctions of causing the lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in such situations, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", stating that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic minority leader, described Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice from emotion, while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesquely coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony has proven that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because he has shown that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified by those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi deviated from the topic when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I just want to say this: if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he's considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Wow, that's great!'", Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribes, months and years of anger accumulated and he can't speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's anything unusual, is it?
She continued: "I got significant help from a woman who is an executive, who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad, because you see me crying".
I'm nervous. I know.
And then you go on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing.
Tears are allowed for the expression of anger, in part because they're fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started crying from an inexpressible rage, is that I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman, a cold manager who I always felt a little afraid of, and she took me up the stairs.
"She must never see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad you made them feel that way.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision", she says, laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was coming to an end, she was behind on her fundraising and vowed she wouldn't run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so emotionally affected  by the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination  that she lost her voice because of the emotions.
"You'd say I had a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder of the press reaction to her.
You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my headstone.
Did she cry?
How can a trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
The rumours that the trade war between the United States and China has begun have been deafening, and while it looks like it's a long way from being over, the quarrels between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs, which affected $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods from China that arrive in the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing a 5 to 10 percent tariff on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly yielding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than what has been predicted so far", said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for refugee return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to get things back to normal.
The conditions in place allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from insurgent-sponsored countries would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States now have their sixth consecutive victory in Europe and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to the top spot after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had put in an incredible effort throughout much of the tournament, sent the ball from the opening shot into the water at hair 3 on the 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari had an incredible performance in all the group stages, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost on holes 5 and 4 to the last-placed player from the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost on holes 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, possibly his last Ryder Cup match.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the most-capped player in Europe, averaging 25.5 points throughout his career.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that we were able to win the cup again.
It's a team effort and I'm glad we could be of help", Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He hands the reins to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golfing legend, on holes 2 and 1, in the singles game on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to beat Tiger Woods, I used to watch his matches when I was a kid", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put in a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played amazingly throughout the entire tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I am proud of them, they really tried.
This morning, there were a few moments where I put pressure on the European team.
I fought a bitter battle.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must give them the respect they deserve.
They played better than us.
