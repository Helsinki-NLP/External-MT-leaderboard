The UKIP remnants who refuse to accept those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for people coming to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he says yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them with barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondriacs who think they owe it all to themselves.
I think you're the one using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing lunatics, is virtually non-existent.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So nobody would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there's no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can emerge as a revolutionary.
A citation from a torch is not evidence.
Yeah, shoot the messenger then.
The Mail didn't write the report, they just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You also know nothing about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's statement surprised many, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to get over it.
I'm not sure where you're coming from, but I'm guessing you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcherite followers who think that AIDS and floods are a sign from God and not a reflection of their own failure to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
The situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the austerity period will not have solved anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was hailed as the 'TIGER OF EUROPE' a few years ago.
We've seen the rest!
That's why I'm recommending you read the article.
It is being tried to make Ireland appear to be a virtuous country and that a 'NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, continuing emigration.
With these ingredients, there is nothing to 'pave' for now with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, along with Portugal. On a constant perimeter basis, without the new countries, the situation is still better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
The development of these countries has not been a quiet, long river, as is clear from recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true.
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by multinationals.
According to a report published in 2008 or 2009, women in France pay less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay the full price.
Now I can confirm that the traffic is back to being huge, and there are new cars (and new cars) on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I've lived in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since I came back.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will be on fire soon.
In another article they're writing, two Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a collision on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary is about to buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will be forgotten soon.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it's not on one of those two once they're done.
Then it would be entirely the other pilot's fault.
Has Ryanair charged passengers extra for the additional fear we have provided them?
But without these Irish businesses, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I've never been on Ryanair, and the last three times I've been on a plane, it's been with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can enjoy it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare should only blame themselves, etc.
It's pretty clear.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs resulting from this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether compensation will be required for passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake by airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they're not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that is taking the British ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrianised, and literally crammed with people.
People don't come in droves for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the magazine show at the Whitecoat Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is because the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and vibrant.
With many foreigners spending .....
You think opening up on Sundays is gonna create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sundays, crowded with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux ! What are you doing ?
The only argument that seems to me acceptable is that the areas receive a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in retail.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
The industry is still the only one where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, helps to bring down prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, except in exceptional cases.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
The Minister for Economic Affairs and, moreover, the Minister for Foreign Affairs have no power to reform the Labour Code.
While they're locking her up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal, on Sundays, I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
That's access to culture.
And so is the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the estate expenses?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some aren't terrible.
I'm sure his estate would like a piece of the pie, if you'll pass the phrase along.
His preference for a nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and add to that his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
I'm not sure either.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to other aristocrats in the government who wanted to discuss an agreement with the Nazis and he won very cleverly.
With his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the belief that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God that for those five years, just those five years, Churchill was at the helm and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise money for the estate, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to see one in a museum, they should raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it came to the moment of truth, Churchill's personality was a positive asset to his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure projects are by definition not renewable.
The social reforms advocated by the Minister reflect the real evil of France: the distrust of dialogue.
Back to the principles.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weak among us not be in need.
Either we come to his aid in solidarity, or he has a RIGHT in return for the services he provides or he has returned with a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the SMIC fits that vision.
There's also the landlord who lives off the income from his properties.
A distinction should be made between those who invest for a return on their retirement and those who live on their pensions.
A property to rent or two for a couple above, that's vice
The little genius in finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The New Deal was a policy of large-scale construction, but at a time of great infrastructure shortages.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so a new deal is not a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline is emerging in response to a recession which is nothing but a savage decline, which is brutal.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate and energy shocks less severe, then the need for investment is crying: insulation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, energy transport and storage, etc.
A tax system that favors high-income and pensioners.
Who's in charge?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a real gallop.
Samsung's profits are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's introduction in mid-September of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I've tried all these phones and I've decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we had a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have multiple dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
We all have different needs, and they cannot be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don't value design, preferring options, functionality, and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a better car manufacturer? Not really, they're different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It's healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in the interest of all of us.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our friends, the umpfrontists, who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, they are Parisian idiots) could they tell us which author they are fighting ideas about the genre and indicate the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just tackling the kind as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
So, their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I like you, and you're a smart, educated man.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, a similarity that hadn't occurred to me (I don't have his wit).
Otherwise, in the "background", since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and honestly I do not see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
@Jean: acknowledge that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne does.
Who 's afraid , the world asks ?
But what do we fear when we fear?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by describing Judith Butler as a very symbolic throat slasher.
You can see how deeply these studies affect their innermost selves.
We are obviously no longer in the debate on ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ John, did you read that Le Monde published an article on the need for theology?
@: As for an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To claim to fight ideas from the sole exposition of their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But, you know, as I was explaining to our umpfrontist friend, that's the difference between having an informed opinion and just having an opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat slitter, I settled on the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is I think the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights as the moon briefly appeared as the clouds opened.
The sudden appearance of the red moon was charming and compensated for the disappointment of sometimes being blinded by clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really cover the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special flash of the blood moon.
Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey are holding Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it back its true colour as soon as possible.
It's got you hooked, hasn't it?
I was in Melbourne, so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself for the whole week from the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's an evil genius whose sole purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the mountain range.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a TAXE on this eclipse.
Anyone watching this eclipse should pay a TOL.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last thought before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he (necessarily) disappears?
It seems you spent a lot of time reading the discussions, looking for posts where people criticized the Abbott government and then accusing them of being obsessed with EUX.
This is a beautiful picture of the moon over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth !
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequality between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments for these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so that one can form an opinion.
Today, Tuesday 15 October, you can see the results of the miracle revenue: in Spain, exports are at their lowest level in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
But it seems that these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of around EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy assures us that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have reaped the political benefit of the notaries' courageous attack have the same courage when they present the bill to the state budget?
The next one in time.
Okay, thank you, JYL.
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the state's time horizon is theoretically infinite while the household's is limited by the lifespan of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing tangible and intangible investments as a guarantee of future growth and thus future revenues.
A few things to answer.
It's a regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred Hippocratic oath: the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
That's a lovely conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth is not your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but their hands are tied by the law as written by the policies.
It is the same with the product that causes medical abortions rather than risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money on drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money on drugs. Since the Liberals want our health care system to be like the United States, you should learn how it works.
All over the world, doctors are courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been a misnomer to blame the medical profession, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and research.
So read the few reports on our spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the world prices of medicines everywhere, as well as the differences from country to country in what is available over-the-counter or on prescription only.
It's a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing inhaling marijuana for cancer pain, despite the laws that restrict it and the expensive licenses that are required.
While the manufacturers of some drugs may not be pleased with the use of alternatives such as marijuana, those who can find a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong. There's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacies.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital administrator.
We can't have patents on weed...
If social scientists did research instead of politics and networking, maybe we could use their work.
A researcher does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not searching.
Comparison is making teaching not research.
You can't say that research is done, you have to apply it and then in the same breath you have to experiment with everything.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can you explain to me how a researcher can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make learning possible on the condition that students learn how to use new technologies, but how will they learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
The Pisa tests are just an indicator. We make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that tells you what's going on, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues out of training and to keep practitioners from teaching practitioners.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the introduction of a new system of training for the younger generation, and the Commission has already made a number of proposals for the introduction of a new system of training for the younger generation.
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in a modern teacher training system.
The theoreticians of education should have no place.
The practitioners, they must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon who is trained in theoretical surgery and has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
To give more weight to the theoreticians of education would be to destroy it for good.
Your analogy is totally ridiculous: if I do not want to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and has been trained on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP responsible for fighting copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you, M.D.
If I ever start feeling guilty about copyright infringement, I'll just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement is theft.
It's the same thing since they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a licence costs nothing.
No, that's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without proper licensing, you're depriving artists of their livelihood.
You can always argue about pedantic assumptions - but that's stealing.
And you can say it all you want, but it's not gonna come true.
That's a violation of copyright.
Go on, say it again.
If I ever start to feel guilty about copyright infringement
I guess you don't mind taking the artists off their payroll.
If they think they should be paid for images used in schoolwork, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson number one should be to show how, if children create anything themselves and post it on their favorite social networks, they give up any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions that they have gone through with one click.
Maybe if they share their MP3 player headphones with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in that way.
If we could export this resource that we have so abundantly, the whiner that says everything is wrong...
If a member of the Socialist Party says so, we must believe him.
I have two children, and when they're old enough to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing changes by then.
France is pulling people down by continuously assisting them.
I don't want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What's dragging France down are speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private company all my life.
I have had the chance to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: this exists in France but is rare.
I am an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the bad bosses I frequently meet.
I am in the position of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan, who is telling the terrible truth.
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small ones - What are French bosses waiting for to do the same?
The state holding their hand?
The state they accuse of imperialism?
@ Jacques L.
You're still so anti-corporate.
Remind me, what have you created as a job, as an added value, to be so strict?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are bowing and wailing while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's awful!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45 hours a week for 35 hours, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the negative comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From where I'm standing, Last hasn't been much of an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than change.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took over.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I tried to get them recently, but I couldn't.
But, you know, Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, right?
It's an international branch.
They already run trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from starting a more ethical business and participating in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatised services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision would finally be overturned.
And there's even better news: MTR, a Hong Kong company, has won the eight-year operating contract for Crossrail.
Well, Labour, as they repeatedly told us during the referendum campaign, is totally in favour of pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision.
Perhaps it is because the Dutch management is on the right track and the British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a fighter girl".
God, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Suppose that being "beat" is a quality superior to many others, caring for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beat" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: "beat" cancer patients, who have died, I know of many who have been beaten.
Getting over a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's do it again.
I'm not saying it's the condition for coping, I'm saying it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit!
When it comes to your life's examples, you're the only one to judge them.
I'll do it again.
To suggest, even for a moment, that you can have merit in getting out of a disease or that you can deserve not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body either follows or it doesn't.
A body that's giving up, from all sides, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, do you have any vague idea what C is?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, but having a strong moral code may make it easier to accept and prepare for difficult treatments, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we're going to leave it to the Lord, that's another matter.
Not with merit, not with courage.
These are the views of moralists.
When you catch a dirty one, a real one, you get so stripped down that you're nothing but a zombie.
I've personally caught two of them, dirty, fat ones, and if I've "fought" as these fine psychologists say, it's completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is all about grinding your teeth, going through hell and taking the beats.
I thought the indictment of Milosevic was decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday party.
A forgotten birthday. I'm not sure what to do.
His trial was conducted quickly and then swept under the rug.
Is that the story we told back then?
The communist-turned-nationalist who has started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The communist president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what we have deliberately left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the WORST rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack?
Speaking of RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he'd be swallowed by the Western Compressor Roller.
The West used a smoke screen to detach part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states who then lied end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he could not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we don't like him).
To my knowledge, only in Greece is there a method of predicting earthquakes that works roughly, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of research is certainly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which is the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules, according to a study led by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine at the University of Maryland.
So, that's the way to go.
Just like the ones involving animals sensing a threat coming.
Thank you, Pasteur de sciences, for giving us so often the experience of the world's great experiments.
How would the animals know (in advance)?
Perhaps by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Radon, for example.
A gas that is a priori odorless to humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable by man, but not by the measuring instruments at his disposal.
We have no reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals behave strangely a few hours after an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte about the struggle of two scientific teams, one from California, the other from Japan, to get the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to the earth's magnetic fields, and more specifically their modification before an earthquake.
So I'm not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me.
Where are we on this research?
Why so much disdain for this lead?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a reputable journal, and no one will despise it.
When we talk about the signs given by animals, we run into the same bias: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake, the redfish was spinning in circles in a strange way.
I don't understand how anyone could think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and is always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the anchor asked him what he agreed with.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected mayor and he didn't keep any of them.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was on Have I Got News For You.
Because he's a celebrity and people have been taught to worship celebrities.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the party leadership, the Tory popularity ratings will be skyrocketing I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their Prime Minister to be one.
That's exactly what we used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always been uninterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are, including one in French and excellent B.
The millot, the Solomon and the scrap-line speak, as sadly as the dead who have remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who knew (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must still be in the background since the Battle of Savo), did not want to return.
We have actually passed Savo Island in Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is over.
That's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smog.
Calculate the kerosene consumed to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors that are philanthropists.
Another com operation neither done nor done.
The cow, it makes me want to go!
I'm looking forward to the web series!
Your story makes me think again, and I feel a little more like myself (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest).
Hats off to the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep us coming back, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago
I think the red-headed man who protested against the taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Bretagne region and the city of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a single penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of a few adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian squad who are of Kosovar origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
Bisevac is the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the '70s and '80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he's from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in the great Velez team which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished second in the Yugoslav league (and also featured greats like Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
He was said to be a great player when he was at Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn.
I can't help you with that.
I know he lost his job when Conte came in, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a tenant.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, you have nothing to fear.
You should like Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag on that drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little overly nationalistic, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn't much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How could you have felt "an explosion of joy" when you saw two towers collapse knowing that women, men and no doubt children were inside?
How did you do that?
What bothers me a little about this "testimony" is that the mere fact that he was able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a "borderline" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost caution.
Perhaps during the brief "joyful" moment, we will not think of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It would have seemed, for a moment, that for once, Muslims had managed to do real and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To be powerful.
It was great.
It seems that this sentiment was shared by thousands of Muslims who were consumed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
It's classic Schadenfreude. It's the way it is.
We kind of knew that.
The "Christian/white/Gaulish" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, and hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
Past splendor, certainly magnified, is no consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
In total, two major poisons are poisoning the Arab world: the conservative bigotry of the ruling class and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the disfellowshipping (soft or armed) of his critical expression.
The fact that we understood it before must not make the Muslims back down.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of a long, dark, wet, depressing six months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everybody gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and my kind.
A dose of vitamin D should help with mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, rain or no rain.
The countryside is particularly breathtaking in the autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the summer greenery when everything is alive instead of dying.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, so don't be your clichéd grumpy-ass.
Not all of them.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now that I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to outside germs, I guess that can change.
It's not about dying, it's just one step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates in celebrations like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the dangers of snowfall and many other wonderful words.
Just keep doing things !
Here's my holiday recommendations for you.
Yes, those dark, gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child allowances, the amount collected by the State is essentially from the 8 to 10 deciles.
However , the number of households whose taxes have increased as a result of this measure is mainly concerned with the 4 and 5 deciliters (median income), as shown in Chart 2 .
The removal of the half share, especially for widows, is not discussed in the article at all or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on the straw, but we're dreaming.
Once the PS makes a policy of the left, we won't cry...
It is obvious that those in the top 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Keep it up and you'll encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the recycled OCI at the PS: they got it all.
Adam, you're not seeing what you're looking at.
The ratio is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once money is no longer useful, it is used only to make money, that is, to bring misery to the greatest number.
We're in the top 20 percent.
Perhaps also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to enjoy some of their efforts.
Or maybe you should just give up and live on the minimum social, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge beheaders have happily lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
I'm not worried.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a five-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the front desk or face the slightest hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep in their house, clean up after yourself, and then leave.
From now on, it'll be my first choice when I'm traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowners' insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb. I know.
 It is very dangerous and highly risky  No it is not true.
You just really had your luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
When he was discharged, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why is this article quoting Teman complaining that he didn't get any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, for receiving as for traveling
Hi. I'm looking for people who've used airbnb before just to reassure myself.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent all at once but I'm a little afraid of sending £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
Supporting the troops, singing the Bu$herie in all tones...
So they're harmless weapons.
I am sure it will be a great pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends died in something other than Saddam Hussein's chemical bombings.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).
Moreover, how would this mass murder committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It's not clear what the author's style is: looking for weapons of mass destruction.
We're on the same page.
You think it's time to weaken the military to strengthen education
It's never the time to reinforce education, because we're always at war.
Alternative: Is it always time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
We would already be greatly improving education if we made them work 35 hours instead of 17.
Our teachers are currently earning more than engineers.
And let us not be led to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But you can't see that because the National Education cannot afford to provide a college/high school office for their teachers so they work from home.
A kind of forced telework, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection or the supplies.
Besides, there's so much hiding at 5 p.m. a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't even fill out the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don 't want to fuck with some bad-mannered motherfucker whose parents spit on you and call you a jerk ?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where you can see that the Bush administration has absolutely screwed up.
My first job after graduation was in sales in London, earning three times as much as nothing, and yet it was a job that required a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad for a London Underground worker, it was paid £5,000 more a year and they didn't even ask for the patent.
I never regretted it.
Don't worry about it if you can't get a job. Try something that either pays well or you like to do.
If I'd stayed in graduate jobs, I'd still be paying off my student loans.
I'm not really a big corporate person, so I hope to eventually go into either the public sector or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year delay.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of the backward fields like art/literature/theater/media/philosophy/political science, that is what is called the unemployment diploma.
I have one of those degrees and I ended up as a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and going on to university.
The starting salary was lower, but you're moving up the ladder quickly because in the real world, what matters is results more than knowledge.
This debate of engineering studies/art courses has been going on for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in ways that get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are all just a bunch of little things?
This is ridiculous.
I assume you're talking about media studies or whatever the fuck industry you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture like literature, art, etc., and show them off.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to relieve Paris and give the rest of France a boost?
I personally cannot see people from the lower Essonne and Val-d'Oise riding their bicycles every day for 80 km to and from Paris to work.
Intra-city and small-belt residents already have many more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, such as those already in place in northern European cities such as Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is being cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
We can all benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found room for ONE bike hook.
The motivation seems to be stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë...
Well, that's not right.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that stand out are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, trucks, scooters that drive super fast and don't care about the survival of bicycles 2/ we get a lot of pollution in our heads For me, cycle paths are a bad place to go, we have to reduce the traffic (urban toll), reduce the speed (Paris = 30), respect the road code by cycling systematically (even the bemole buses have to adapt the road code written for bicycles 100 years ago to bicycles), generate the zones after the pedals, otherwise we do not have to pass the pedals and scooters do not pass.
Cycling is apartheid, we must live together but re-balance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big city of Paris ?
Not a word about the bicycle's place in public transportation?
EELV is right.
The 15% target for cycling is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to think that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In fact, after what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem skeptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, we better find out who's really behind this massacre.
Clue: this is not Russia.
Not sure I like the way the world is changing.
It looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to take the case to the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they would have to lodge a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be deferred pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the subsequent criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the airspace security authority is to blame, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down before, Ukraine was launching air strikes in the area against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or has it chosen to gamble with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay the overland fees?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government/the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in broad terms that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there's already a complaint against the Kiev government because they're responsible for what's going on in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice which concluded that the CIA's supply of arms to the Contras rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There's no way Russia's gonna let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott is trying to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to back up his allegations.
So far, the investigators have said nothing of the sort.
To be called Ricardo and to be such an eco-beotian, it's distressing!
Being called Polar is losing the north is a joy.
One question of the Beotian: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I cannot help but notice that those who most virulently criticize Piketty's book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of income from labour, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today is the same as it was at the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the 2nd world war that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how concentration resumes afterwards...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what?
I'm asking you how long it took you to read this paving stone knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Second, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, one can debate it without having read the book, the main point of which is to argue in one direction in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read.
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paved by the press is false?
I haven't read it and I won't.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis, which seems to me to be pure nonsense.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has not mankind as a whole become enriched?
And this enrichment coupled with an increase in population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive figure and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age when most people are just starting to find their place in the world.
I hope this prize won't be a burden on the girl and that she finds her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All the best to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - not even in the slums of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little weird?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn't Malala herself one of those colored perverts?
You shouldn't have any airtime on this site.
You're a horrible pervert yourself.
This is absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father runs a girls' school and is a supporter of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide for herself on her marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan in that he believes women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that the average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't put it in a way that was eloquent enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe what she's saying is that if her father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
I'm pretty disappointed with this entry in season four and especially Jessica Lange who's obviously having a bit of trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich sock character.
I've just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
Fascinating first episode.
The production is near perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply mind-blowing.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be my last without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have it all at once than watch 13 episodes spread out over three to four months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it's the risks of staging and editing that really got me.
We have an avalanche of original shots in AHS that makes a mockery of the seepage of today's productions.
It's a little bit of a departure from seeing you throwing the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is a mainstay of this series, but, you say it so well, there's so much more.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the show outside of the technical qualities.
And I look after her a lot.
Then I find the show is a little bit of a typo, trying to do too many things at once.
Season 3 was a little understated, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours of what?
But everybody does what they want, right?
That 's why I say I 'll never look back , so everyone has to do the same .
I simply share my viewpoint, nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it's going to be fatal to her.
But then, here's my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who tried to save money failed.
To provoke controversy over relatively minor expenditure items, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change in direction that voters seem to be calling for and all the while some on each side are pretending that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The  debt  is the assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
Debt is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem in the government taking a third of my income (not to mention consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to be used wisely.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It's been said that Nigel Farage hasn't been entirely honest about how to cut taxes, but hey, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies for wind turbines that are pretty much useless, and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you get a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Demo tax on the most luxurious residences look ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is tax-free.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay around £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 would pay around £70,000 (a little over a third).
What about the social security?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and car registration, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is withdrawn at the source before local taxes and car registration.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where billions of pounds of tax goes.
How can an unemployed man who goes door-to-door looking for work prove it?
Even if 20% of the unemployed don't look, that means 80% are looking and can't find it.
I'm unemployed, so what do I care more about what other people are looking for?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances by that much.
I haven't heard from the Employment Bureau in months, so does that mean the agents are more busy with inspection operations than they are with actually getting job ads in?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not the state's job to provide jobs.
If Pole Employ does not provide enough jobs, then we must do without Pole Employ.
How is this a sensitive matter?
We all have rights and duties, and we are making sure that the unemployed do their duty in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport ticket from the users of a means of transport, a head of service or employees of a means of transport are their employees, etc.
Nobody shouts scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I have dealt with the Employment Bureau, my rights to the ERDF had been mis-established, and on one of the cases, which was cut by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Registration and control are now the norm, whereas by statute Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should concern only employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and the French self-employed grant themselves rights they don't have!
This is not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance scheme contributes to the enhancement of wage labour.
More than waiting for some killer tweets in Arabic...
The reality is we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus doesn't reach that conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with war and the displacement of populations at that time.
The Saudis have had the mind to ban this year's Hajj to Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have had their visa applications rejected because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably from a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world has the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose that Ebola patients should not be allowed to fly to Europe?
I thought it was just common sense but apparently those who know have decided that we can risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's going out.
Only medical personnel are allowed in.
21 days after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were infected after coming into contact with people in West Africa despite taking all necessary precautions.
We can stop the spread of this disease.
It's spread mostly through airlines.
Let's stop them from offering to fly to those countries.
In addition, airport customs officers should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately quarantined.
If he can get the message across from the individual first and the group (including religious) second, he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he's capable of erecting a dogma of the image of God as characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception.
It's only been 20 years since information emerged as the prime gift of humanity, while religion, born of the brain, has been guiding our actions since Lucy maybe.
What's the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, and no one is forced to join it.
Critics would not enter the church anyway, just consider the small number of Protestants in France.
What's the next step, we get rid of the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
@louise: Sorry the church doesn't have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you see it pre-existed in Christ.
Hillel a century before said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to you, that is the whole Torah and the rest is just commentary: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond reciprocity and introduces a·gaʹpe.
Your "promoting justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism?
Next step, we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who upended the moral code by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take their part in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and forced to emigrate a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
You can't make this up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you're interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'll take a look.
Obviously not at work.
The happy people in the IT department are blocking all the cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% off, or does £30 include 20% off?
However, be warned: the PC version is for DX11 only.
It caught me by surprise. I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus, I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it sucks.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I believe.
Caveat emptor and all that stuff: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, but I'm afraid that one day they'll delete it from your library if they decide to crack down on people who buy it there when they're out of the designated area.
So join the beta of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "rotten ground"?
So, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
You must love the France of the 40's, the one of the "strange defeat"?
When you see who wins the Nobel Prize for Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, you don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but I honestly doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a remote connection to literature.
Have you even read it?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
That would be better for judging.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
You keep seeing Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso are holding their own.
So let 's see who won the Nobel Prize for Literature: H.
Painter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the awful.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer in Superman III?
Hey, Dantra, you still hating?
Hi DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Party.
It was messy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, with Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not just CAMRA fans (not to be confused with camera fans).
Driving home on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's granddad's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to walk away with several decent bets.
I hope that when I'm 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you'll see how wrong you are, dear Christian.
I do not want to upset you, but I think you are going a little bit off-topic.
This so-called totality prohibits the search for jihadists outside mosques.
She's quick to report weapons trafficking.
Either we have big eyes like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who says no word of consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, my dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, there are those who doubt whether the French Jews approve of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them of it in advance and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that they are wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there's no doubt, so be it.
Who doesn't say the word consent, but consent to what?
Consent to proximity to ISIS or to the condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is a useful tool for those who want to keep the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland might, in the election,  take revenge  on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing his ass off.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland because they have no seats.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing for him and the Conservatives in the long run.
Who's gonna shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They're going to be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who are going to cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the Pledge thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leader to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralisation.
I think that's what's important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected in England.
To blow the pumps at 8%, at the expense of 85%, is not a great electoral strategy.
Moreover, once the Scottish Members of Parliament are no longer able to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked out for her.
Yet he is still in the running for Prime Minister in 2015 and has been since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over their shoulder and see what they're reading, how they're reading, and all the way through.
It's the lives of others from East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination with surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
Wait for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and it automatically does it through an algorithm of its secret !
It's a lot of fun.
It's very stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
Since DRM management is not implemented under this system, I am left to read pirated files, public domain books or books purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer free files.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, I'm not sorry.
I am amazed at the widespread abandonment of users in the face of widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general bookstore, you will notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably low.
For example, Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the era of Big Data, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in one tray.
Collecting anonymous data when there's a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, which does not allow to identify the readers or the authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in the last few days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of acid-fed schizophrenic kids.
It's even worse than that if you consider Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some of Erdogan's supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.
Good point :-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot unless it's going to gain something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it's effectively shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog:  The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a severe warning of retaliation or simply advising caution.
The second option is more likely, and in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment is to Syria, Israel and the security of the region.
The short article you link to is important and should be read with the realistic observations/warnings from Iran about Afghanistan around 1979-80.
Who are these  moderates  who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
The pipeline policy is pushing the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to nonexistent moderates to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending each other's children to fight in World War III.
 It's even worse if you consider Erdogan's religious fundamentalism  Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
We need a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should I ?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP which planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by the Armenians in revenge, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a shady place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there with the dream of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delusion !
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but other than that, we seek contact with reality in vain.
What a bunch of clichés without a point.
The fetus will always hear a heartbeat even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire for children and not a desire to be accepted.
So are heterosexual couples who are infertile.
And the children!
It's a shame to call them future psychological imbalances.
One day, they'll be old enough to defend themselves, say they're happy to be alive, earn a living and pay that lady's pension.
GPA is probably a temporary "solution" to the medical evolution of our world.
It's not from today.
Many women have conceived and given birth to children not by their husbands.
It's still the way it is, we're made of it.
The important thing is that this practice should be regulated so that the 'commoditisation' of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics, aren't they also body merchandising?
I 'm going to the hospital .
It is certainly more elegant to get a maid fat in a distant country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to take on her responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting it at this time on all rooftops! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church! . . .
It is not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
But the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, that man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands, I only saw it from a distance.
I had to go in the daytime because I wasn't allowed to go at night!
But if you like it and you listen to the music -- that music today still touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many derogatory comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe there's an article on football in the sports section waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there's been a shortage of news stories that truly reflect the reality of the culture of the North of England.
No wonder Paul Mason has a good grasp of the social and political context. He understands things.
Northern soul is still alive, but it's been vampirized by capitalism and today it's essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can take a look if you're in the London area in November: 99psoul will be playing soul vinyl again, including full Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I thought the same thing too, but here's a little article well written and thought out.
Your criticism really needs to be more constructive.
That's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you got away from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
By swallowing pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was, it was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently crime series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more toxic.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu is not seeking peace because he wants to continue occupying-colonizing (by the way, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He stripped off his clothes, laid them on the rock, and jumped into the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up angry and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even here then!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: "And now that things are clear
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not let down their guard...
That anti-Israel dislikes it is obvious, it is not the aim sought...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it 's been that way ever since politics became globalized ...
I'm not going to.
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it lasts!
You are not responsible for the creation of Israel.
What was the power relationship that allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a power struggle today !
Do you doubt that?
Besides, it's not just Russell Brand, but the Guardian reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says is pseudo-chomskyist billets written by others.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths we'd rather not think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to spread more and more!
I can understand why Brand is horrified by some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the nonsense in the tabloids he actually makes it sound like a novice populist, but this whole no-voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he's just telling people not to vote and instead to fold their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I guess) and limiting democratic commitment to that is completely useless, both parties (to slightly different degrees) governing essentially in favor of vested interests, multinationals and the rich, At no point is it to ignore politics completely because these parties don't govern in our name: he insists on saying that just voting and disconnecting for five years should become more politically active, from organizing protests, to trying to influence people at the local level, to trying to influence the political movements, to organizing lots of people, to trying to organize a lot of people.
I'm not necessarily saying I agree with his solution (because I think being politically active by presenting your demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are like flower heads who will change their minds if they really risk losing the election), but it's infuriating to see all these condescending responses that say that this fool who does Jesus is telling young people not to bother voting and just hope that everything will be better because it's really twisting his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually says rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The whole voting thing was completely twisted.
The point is that the Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who are accountable locally to their constituents.
I also disagree with the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label  billed pseudo-chomskyists .
I'm pretty sure that in a debate he could convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, have Suzanne do Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a porch, with even the head shaking added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but eventually became a fan and invited him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he's going with it.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This 'scrub' shows me above all that intellectual debate has long since ceased in the historical RDVs, where professional historians have become a minority and where the exchange of specialists has been reduced to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po press files.
I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take on a guilty man, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats who are the key to their thinking.
I think that for Foucault the state was indispensable as the culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, the thought of sacrifice, which is also the thought of magic.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or/liberal slope (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to go to seek the state's help for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not at all state in Foucault.
The old dream of the base, which is self-organizing.
Its thinking is based on the state's guilt: without that guilt it cannot stand.
Guilty means elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Not a support system.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, the old days of its god, Stalin, the father of the nations.
Oulala, you may have read a shouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology for Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would not like to attack Michel in this way...
Gauchet makes a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can't stand to be disregarded for their mantras is quite ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
I think it is important to add that the attitude of these 'rebels' is purely intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other yellow people I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where in Russia could a Russian meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can't remember the last time I saw a Chinese.
London and they were kind to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them saying things that are violently anti-white.
My dad's not happy about his oldest daughter dating a white guy.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people are traveling abroad and seeing how others live.
From what I've been told, Russians are particularly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and areas where they have a high chance of being exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australian people's views on the Chinese and the Aboriginal people.
It's really strange that a foreigner tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two in my life (including one abroad), I don't have any bad memories of them, everyone is worth it and, in fact, the people in London were very nice that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise you can't remember who you meet, everyone's fighting, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as some kind of unique fascination, like they're an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're still dating this white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there's a good chance that these white people's parents would physically assault them.
No measure of fairness of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly left-wing groups like the Judiciary Syndicate...
@Marabout: Sorry, but the legal community is frankly a trademark.
In the Judicial Union, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If one can measure its bias from the relativity of the application of the law in the courts, it requires that two obstacles be avoided.
The political vision of the observer and the factual interpretation of the judge.
The law is thus still the mandatory tool for refocusing evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of judges, including the public prosecutor's office, forces a distinction to be made between error and the partiality of judges.
It would be futile to claim that acts of justice are not shared among these three groups.
The claim and the lack of knowledge which cannot be objectively analysed.
And if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics which implicitly show that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to insert the following into the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
This is a sensitive matter in proportion to the power of nuisance conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The field in question is that of spoliation of heirs by means of fraudulent proceedings by estate genealogists appointed by notaries.
The profession earns €150 million a year and enjoys the protection of the French notary's near-impunity.
To help understand their mechanism, some of them were reported in the comments following the first publication.
This is in addition to the statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, which is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be thus spoiled, a whole body of case-law contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics without such rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
Probably totally prohibitive prices.
More stuff to scam the handicapped.
You could say that, but my brother has one of those off-road tricycles, custom-built for his size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like no normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tank Chair looks like something Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a Top Gear challenge.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean dog shit off a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love an off-road tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices do seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so you see.
The off-road tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have insurance policies available for a reasonable amount.
Only if they've become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche market, so they can afford to charge high prices for things that they know we need.
You can't really say the Whill is minimalist.
It's an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, there's no plan to manufacture it.
I'm glad the long-distance wheelchair isn't coming on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes have been destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, in intensive shelling of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been held prisoner by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-old children have lived their whole lives under Israeli blockade!
The situation is unique in the world, unacceptable, and illegal, since the blockade is imposing a collective punishment on all civilians in Gaza.
" The contractors who work on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market " ...
That's not a wooden tongue, more concrete and armed lady...
References are there to support an argument or a fact.
You 're anti-Zionist .
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's a black market, that's for sure, and it's recognized.
Two million people have been held captive by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
This is a unique situation in the world, a situation unacceptable to anyone with a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had re-established the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I agree with...
Jonathan , I 'm not ...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the population who chose their masters!
Owning a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought this through.
Couchsurfing is way cooler than Airbnb.
That's the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
A lot of people are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping to get paid) in a different way.
It's still a lot cheaper than a hotel, if you look for the right addresses.
In addition, landlords and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
What's she renting on?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We don't use the verb  to let  in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
You'd better have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it's 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do commercial activity on it (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that ships can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The boats are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be near where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates.
All these Somali immigrants coming here and attacking our boats...
Where are you gonna tie it?
No, Marine Le Pen is wrong!
Populism ?
There is no truth but the truth that makes things clear!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people are leaving school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said !
Capitalism is not going to get poorer!
High finance, speculation, plays with our companies, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, with our food, so our food, with the structures of care, so our health, with our debts, so our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and by our money that they hold..
All for the benefit of some hyper-mega-money-obsessed.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild banker as his minister of economy, to better defend the interests of the banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Wasn't there anyone else who was competent?
What do you call it, turning his jacket over, lowering his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don't really know what Marine Le Pen is thinking.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really refused to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book  Castles of Steel  suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still rough at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fighting ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Falklands War, where the photos of survivors being rescued show a calm, daylight sea.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, that doesn't quite match what I remember reading about that battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
Some confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two battlecruisers, which had disappeared into the dark after the cease-fire, and a pursuit began.
The Leipziger saw something burning, but when he got closer he saw it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and badly damaged but still moving.
After pointing his spotlight at the ship's flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without any reliable information, von Spee thought the Good Hope must have escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before radar was invented, didn't know that a ship had sunk, and so they couldn't look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they skimmed off to take advantage of their lead.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already hurt them and cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several voices have been raised in the UMP calling for it to be enshrined in law that an elected official who has been permanently convicted is therefore permanently ineligible.
That is a courageous position, which would certainly affect the elected representatives of the left.
But, no, this is a joke.
For this I propose an inscription on the wall of the magistrates' cones.
When will the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors be lifted?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens?
It is being run by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to please those who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to make things move, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is to the extent of their sufficiency.
I met them on the subway at around noon with their little "pennies for justice" signs. They were from the provinces and they didn't know the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
She supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold to the service of her party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted figures on its side and waged a legal and media war against them.
Your statements are totally gratuitous.
If right-wingers are currently avoiding the news of justice, it is simply because they have committed acts that fall within it!
We don't have an example of a leftist personality who has had so much to do with justice but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it should be recalled that the left-wing union of the judiciary is not the only union of judges and is in the minority.
The fact that a minister supports unions with such commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you mention may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is no secret.
It is now questionable whether the "mission" of some judges is more to dirty than to educate.
@ gus - You should be pleased, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not civil servants like other people: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody ?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
This is Katie Waissel.
I think even the most gluttonous moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if anyone took their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction are filling stadiums all over the world.
Others went on to sell a lot of records or went to the West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these shows, launched Chreyl Cole, who is, in fact, on the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all of them have been in the Eurovision Song Contest, as have so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the rest have competed in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have forgotten.
But that's what happens to most stars who don't compete anyway.
Few people can make another tube after one.
Anyway, most singers/bands can hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
Her fame comes in part from her marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock road, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar-playing weed-smoking guys in their dad's garage and swinging three chords on a grade-school-level poem are bound to become stars and the only question is how much they want to make before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied  distance that turns rather quickly to racism, because sacred ethnologists present us with these distant people as infinitely superstitious and full of ritual bigotry, when most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations in everyday life.
Except you recklessly interpret it the other way around.
So, rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is like reminded to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, though.
It's ephemeral decorating to fill the void.
That's all I'm saying.
That's a great article, thank you.
The recent pantheonisation of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacredness is still alive.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists !
Any other discipline would throw at the net completely unscientific interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative review of disciplines for a laugh?
Because what is true of archaeology is also true of the interpretations given by other disciplines.
That would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified !
They are constantly discovering treasures, valuable evidence for reconstructing history, understanding societies, and the example of comparative archaeology here is fascinating.
This method is not very old and in the past archaeologists relied on their instincts and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have such high technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries !
This is a time of great (and old) controversy about shamanism advanced by prehistorian Jean Clottes (see his book Les chamanes de la préhistoire, particularly the augmented re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article.
Do straight men like anal sex ?
For you, Mike, I could get into it.
So we're through?
I don't really understand why can't we just go on three?
This is supposed to be a serious, adult magazine.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical about it, but that would be too gay!
We should have expected that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you switch to the Catholic Times?
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, brave reporters to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc., at their own peril.
Rather than getting teased with your childish ass-kidding.
Not very smart.
Go on then.
If these childish ass-jokes are so shocking to you, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it's quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, we can find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is solely to protect its interests and by no means those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have taken out the safety because at the moment another vehicle (a tow truck for example) was entering the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon, which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not think it was appropriate to move the start time forward (TV rights, advertising, money...).
But other than that, they're good at protecting pilots.
Well, I agree with you.
But there's also the fact that if the very British FOM gets the SC in, it'll give Nico Rosberg a chance at the restart to beat the Englishman who was leading at the time...
You're running around on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to dig through all your sh*t.
No, I just didn't.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts stewards in mortal danger over a distant story of one driver's winning at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that issues the safety because it's the FIA.
Shade of size.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of images mostly allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner waves a green flag in the middle of the intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the footage of the accident but because one of the stewards clearly sees a green flag waving, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are no longer under yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag rule AFTER the accident, hence the waved green flag.
It's the usual procedure.
The control station just downstream of the crash (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the crash) waves the green to tell the pilots to resume normal speed.
Sensationalism is what sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government's patriotic propaganda offensive but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for the money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making a fuss about information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep people scared so we can keep controlling them.
When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all get scared. It should be "distracted", not "all".
Given the medical reference,  coughing  is much better said in this context than  derailing .
I wonder if all the people who are worried that Ebola could start spreading through the air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much credit.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse that is coming.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola with Murdoch.
Great article, thank you.
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicule this abject pseudo-journalism.
That made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talks about most things with this upside-down optimism.
The goal is again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting hysterical) for the government to slide us off when it needs to.
I think it's perfectly logical that if we're going to have a budget emergency without any crisis, a terrorist emergency without any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis without any confirmed case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and on being still in this world almost 35 years later.
And at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years.....
It's totally useless.
It's always the same when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless, but taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: The testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions my psychiatric mother explaining that I was educated telepathically by her stepmother.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's nonsense, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of the new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
So what's your research based on?
On some fantasy ?
You're putting fantasy theories on the same level as facts?
 Resilience : the phony word adored by grandmothers, fans of J.L. Delarue, who think they're great psychologists after reading Dansembourg.
@Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in the psychology community.
Cyrulnik has given us the "resilience" blow.
And as a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he's come up with a reliable scale to quantify this resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company?
Doesn 't that remind you of Team America ?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to bring the Sentinels out of the air...
Why would you do that?
It was a great show, and it seems like the people who are doing it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty, who can perform miracles.
But how are they gonna get the kids to hang up?
The only solution I can think of is the pee-caca humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in the Supermarine class ?
It won't be the same if we don't see the wires and the animation is done right.
I'm looking forward to seeing this (although I'm an adult), but I hope it gives a network the idea to rebroadcast the old ones.
The show has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; we've had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m. for at least 40 years.
Since the advent of free digital television a few years ago, it's been on one of the second-tier commercial channels and you can still watch it at these times.
And half-hour episodes are now airing at 5:30 from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a sad 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mountain" in or under the Esplanade Mosque!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations under and around the mosque of the Esplanades over the past several decades have yielded nothing.
The Temple Mount if it exists, it's somewhere else.
Can it be in Argentine?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the Mosque of Omar.
Muslims believe that Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Once it's been captured and contextualized, there's no propaganda, there's information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and sabotaged it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful event.
Will God recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke is "Praise God!"
To boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown half-naked young women lying on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what is advertised, as can be seen in the photo illustrating the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this picture is a beautiful propaganda work!
It's a pity that the Reuters photographer didn't take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone the Jewish worshippers below, praying at the Wailing Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is rightly so, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that should be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be going downhill, big companies have taken a huge advantage of their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time, and without hiding it, they have given ever higher salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will change in this country only when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of whining and moaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also show your employer that we don't mess people up with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it's sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
This can't end well.
It's because we're a democracy that it's lasted.
Did you vote for the TCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TICP) aims to increase the profits of the companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this deal will do to our lives.
It's only recently that we've started talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say blood, sweat and tears?
This is a great outcome, whereas digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link is probably the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) think she's the safe house of France's eternal values, and she'll fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of the nation, having this little relic, it's comforting.
Even though it's getting more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, bachelors, married women, bachelors, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't spell French correctly, I'll join the union.
I warned you, it's your fault.
The protection of individual interests is already being sufficiently endured by the protected professions with trade unions, which has created a breakdown in equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public official.
It is quite possible to imagine a system which guarantees a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, it's a disaster.
And with the wagons being prepared, the government is welcoming it.
What kind of security are you talking about?
Ignorance is the answer.
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since that is the subject here commented...
Let us remove "through its delegates" from Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It shall become:
All workers participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises.'
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically titled  The Great British Bake Off review . ?????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought it was time to start the conversation.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you some of it was well-spiced.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (though misleading: it was the wine) in the history of television.
So, the pie, mmmh...
Game of Thrones ! What are you doing ?
I love the GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ended with a win by the least bad baker; nobody said, "Boom, here's my fucking cake now, eat it and bow to your master".
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
For the past few weeks, all these people outside have been kept away.
And then there's this idea of playing it safe, there's always next week, which disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine myself doing that.
I'm grateful to those who do and give us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Let 's go to the 2015 GBBO !
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
The professionals usually take days to make them and they had to craft one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to separate, I don't know how they could pick a winner.
With Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green frosting on Richard's mill didn't make sense, anyway Richard had already lost at that point).
I have to admit that many of the challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allotted.
There's also the cancer that's lurking, with the sun blasts.
We're definitely doing all right now.
A bad time to pass for humanity, we hope.
You're confusing solar wind with ultraviolet.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of the particles of the residual solar wind and UV.
So even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to drive ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would even be more, and therefore less UV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer doesn't block the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't know about.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the potential to make us have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and most UVB pass.
You know you don't have to be condescending and treat your interlocutor like a nut when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the comment, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention I'm a regular with melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They don't provoke it.
To prove it, not all people with tan have melanoma.
So, when a doctor tells you to stay out of the sun and live in a basement, you better not listen because UV rays are necessary for all humans.
Excess, on the other hand, is like anything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays are the direct cause of melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we get it into the blender?
Or put it in the blender...
I think most people who are interested in this have established that anything can be bent if you apply enough force to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and so they haven't yet adopted the iPhone6 as their front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
Still a good choice.
Most of those who are interested in this have established that everything can be bent if you apply enough force to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
We make that joke every time we talk.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth folding joke I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before you install specific software, you imagine that the phone has been taken off the main production line and you have no idea how it could get back on it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ which is why I was so surprised when I saw that you were going to be a part of this group of people who were going to be a part of this group of people.
The most likely is that it's a production unit that hasn't installed iOS properly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logos and the presence of a red prototype connector.
Ah, the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that industrialists produce in  industrialists We put forward super u but all the signs and memes the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650€ (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly on a small salary.
After that, everyone is free to set their priorities wherever they want.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without a grudge, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecologists, people who see the world through an ideological software that causes them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total disaggregation of thought and reason.
They're experts at gestures, like claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining the left-wing caviar, from which they sometimes originate, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while on holiday in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens cannot stand this mixture of heavy ideology and truffles, so don't be surprised if you often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thanks for this complete and exhaustive theorizing and all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not that complicated.
The eco-boys are monoblocks.
You understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologics at the outset.
The boboecolo is one of them but represents only the most visible fringe of the eco-localists because it is the one that infests the media.
There's a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
It's so badly made, it's vaguely resembling a female nude.
Shut up, you're near the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stunning beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The point isn't that Emin can't draw and seems to be obsessed with the same subject.
The point is, she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous without any artistic ability.
That's the art.
No, that's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It's more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing reality.
If that's all you're looking for, a camera will do.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still savings to be made in the horse racing industry, the number of horses in the Republican Guard, and the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
The honesty is that France is reducing its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
That's only half encouraging.
The operative without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence apparatus, particularly in the Sahel.
This is a bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the sanctuary promised?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save but especially not at my house, at my house it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're suggesting we do, look elsewhere where the gabby is certain.
That all those who have been around the military thing for a while dare to come here and say, eye to eye, that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting into laughter...
If we apply the same potion to the whole civil service, the public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really cool: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why the Defense Department can feel a bit overwhelmed!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees on should be done, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
The ones who get it, they moan about the murder when it happens at home, poor darlings.
I should do it, but I don't want it to fall on me, because then it's a crime, not an economy.
Go on, you little shit!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, the story repeats itself every time a post office, maternity ward, hospital, barracks are closed.
But everyone is for the economy of course.
It's strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy about the savings made in public spending.
This article is truly the most mind-boggling thing I've ever read!
That awkward moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's depressing to scroll through your Facebook feed and see that 80% of your friends have started their statuses with the phrase  This embarrassing moment .
I think they're making a movie out of it.
He'll probably base it on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally bumps into their ex on the bus on their way to work and only realizes that her skirt got stuck in her panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally stupid.
Not really, I think the author is playing the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to hide his emotions and clench his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the stage after a 25-year absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who gets the rights?
I don't have the internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how amazing this article is. It's the most amazing thing I've ever read.
Charlie has really demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm going backwards!
I absolutely need to share it with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they can finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and unsurpassed genius that comes out of Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, that was really bad.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite, you know.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are being deprived of the right to save our planet by states that play potatoes at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, as citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the energy commissioner they planted, all those nice recommendations flew away.
Wind turbines and solar farms are the Round Points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
The pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in its waste and in the event of an accident.
Until the whole industry is fully controlled, it is better to limit the work to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not involved in this.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions at generation and epsilon for the other stages.
Renewable wind or PV electricity is already more GHG than other stages and especially gas, or worse than coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would be counterproductive to the fight against CO2.
I'm not insulting you. I'm a doctor of physics from 1981 and I've done research in nuclear physics. I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I've said.
For what I didn't say it's you lending me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't respond to what I said and like all right people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and ineffective way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
If you do not include uranium mining and construction and if you do not include water vapour, a greenhouse gas with a lower impact than CO2, it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant is in part water vapour and partly in river water.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a South Asian giant...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I am not surprised that most of the Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, that's a good look at your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I don't mind some Pakistani players participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply be opening a Pandora's box full of corruption and mobsters.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India is spending on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our noisy neighbours ...
The low-cost pitch race is cash.
It's a shame for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design flaw is only manifested with too cold helium.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but in an implementation flaw...
Unlike ArianSpace which is a private company, it seems that Soyuz is owned by the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates. Who knows?
This is all the more sad because many media outlets are only using the headlines - and many readers only remember these headlines.
This gives a false impression, contrary to the content of the article itself.
I agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project when it is just a launching issue.
