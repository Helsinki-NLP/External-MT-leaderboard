Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity to the Mapetites.
Some members of the Assembly have been overwhelmed by a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this could become the subject of ridicule.
One Labour member of the assembly said his group was concerned because it was rhyme with the Twp and Pwp.
To readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means foolish, and pwp means scorn.
A member of the House of Assembly from the political party Plaid said the group as a whole was more satisfied and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open about the name change, but noted that there was little difference between the terms MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a draft law on the introduction of the name change, stated: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on the proposals which resulted in a large support for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name of Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are reportedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could be headaches for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill within weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of Assembly members and a plan for the commission system.
Members of the assembly will have their last chance to vote on their name when they discuss the bill.
The Macedonians are going to a referendum on changing the name of the state
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents the appropriation of its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider the name change to be simply the price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells on St. Martin's have been silenced as the churches in Harlem struggle to survive.
"The older people I spoke to say that there used to be bars and churches on every street", Mr. Adams said.
"Today there is neither one nor the other".
He said the bar disappearance was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
"Bars are no longer the quarterly lodgings people go to regularly".
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later, it'll go back to where it started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who won't help preserve the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and that's why the closure of these churches will be accelerated because it's unlikely that people who will move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The first white Methodist community moved in in the 1930s.
A black community that worshipped nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the Black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, opposing the hiring or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners prepared a reconstruction plan, they ordered organs.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organs "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the organ in July called them differently: "cultural treasure" and "uninterruptible historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church had found no replacement.
What's been going on at St. Martin's Church for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought in by church leaders, others by the episcopal bishops.
The episcopal administration, the governing body of the diocese, composed of church leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would be forced to bear the costs of the diocese, although the diocese was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old during a cushion hunt in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting for cushions in California on the day of the first cushions hunt, officials said.
The attack happened about seven o'clock in the morning off Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard a boy calling for help and then drove him and his group to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was the excitement of catching a lizard, but then he realized that she was screaming, "She bit me!"
She hit me!
His entire skeleton was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, the shark is in the water", Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady's Pediatric Hospital where his condition is being treated as critical.
It's not clear what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was determined not to be a threatened species.
Giles also added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso area.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to market cosmetics in the style of department stores where professional assistants work.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which is on the rise as sales in the fashion and home appliance markets decline, larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and expanded to more stores next year if successful.
Cosmetic investments come about because supermarkets are finding ways to use shelves that were once used for TVs, microwave ovens, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its cosmetics range by offering more than 3,000 products, including products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product palette from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space in departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup line by making most products vegan-friendly, something younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test out the outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oaks, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and moving to smaller daily purchases of food in local stores mean supermarkets have to make extra efforts to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores in the supermarket's efforts to take back the hit to Aldi and Liddle's discount chains, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos stores in hundreds of its stores, and has also introduced Habitat stores since they bought both chains two years ago, which says has increased sales of food products and profitability of procurement.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to modernize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments has ended in disgrace.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenue in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skincare products to its range in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location mean we are now an independent beauty marketplace setting new standards over the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m deal.
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his personal brand worth £11 million to focus on his contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home furnishings and accessories Truly.
The company of this pair has been compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of This Morning (37) announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered the star of the Dragons' Dan Peter Jones by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute to focus on her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the golden girl of television admitted, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to their brand of household and accessories Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop Company and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, which was estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain for one of her weekends.
The source said Holly put Truly at the top of her own priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would secure her earnings for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
At Marlow headquarters, there's a warehouse full of products ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, who is among Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home appliances, and possible additional delays to launch dates.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tari Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the company in March as a director.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for the M&S brand and replace Anta McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we would not comment on his business.
Hard words, then we fell in love
He was joking about the criticism he might get from the media for comments that could be characterized as "Vice President" and positive views about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said in his funny voice, "News reader".
I didn't give up at all.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump announced their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an adequate response from the United States to North Korea's initial steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were one step away from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to repair relations with Kim have yielded positive results -- suspending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he stood up in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the world in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok Island's population has been displaced, a state of national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, they're still unsure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Pala to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, it's sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often seen in other parts of the coast.
There were no tsunami sirens reportedly on Pala Island, although the warning was in effect, so it contributed to the loss of life.
And under ideal conditions, traveling between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to provide relief to earthquake victims is en route to Paul, but it will take him at least three days to reach the scene of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funds has hit Mr. Joko's administration as he awaits new elections next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure due to long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced by street fighting between Christian and Muslim groups, using knives, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge has scored a deep-lying tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge took the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left side, then walked towards the outside static.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, turning toward the upper right corner of the grid.
It eventually fell over Cape Arrizabalg, which was jumping and fell into the net.
"It was just about positioning, getting the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far forward as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and didn't think much, I just hit the ball".
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a touchdown in the 25th minute.
The blue forward added the ball to Matthew Kovacic's fifth in that attack before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
The quarterback hit fast and put the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard to the penitentiary.
Hazard was faster than the defense and finished close to the stative by putting his left foot in the net past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported as drowning in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and raised the waves to 20 feet, a spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palú, with a population of more than 380,000, is covered in ruins.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called people who saw or heard anything nearby to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said the investigation is in the early stages, but I call on anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken some footage from the cameras on the dashboards of the car, to contact us as they may have information relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they're in the process of informing the victim's family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but police notified him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was left without a text when he found out what happened.
Residents are now told they'll have to wait hours before they're allowed back inside.
They heard a cop tell a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
She kept saying, "It's so horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was right next door.
Most of the officers were inside the police cordon, guarding the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is invited to contact directly @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 citing case 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the newest monument amid a debate over a revision of history
Its removal would represent poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England by the Taliban's puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as folly and an attempt to revise history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace in Westminster would also become a target.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted icon wrestling during the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent depiction of Sir William Hame Thorneycroft is evidence of nineteenth-century opinion and part of the historiography of a character many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, to be the protector of Parliament from external pressures, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and mention.
A pig killer has inflicted fatal injuries on a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man known only as Yuan was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood in a pig's trunk in a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A piger was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with a cousin from neighboring Yunnan area on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, a cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood around his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and torn", said a cousin who introduced himself by the name of Wu, reports Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while the police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the owners of the marketplace are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported earlier.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 livres grabbed a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife scared him and drove him away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a killer.
They're just playing.
They like to spit, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are bringing widespread splashing across the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the colder waters of northern Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding due to the plunges across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosina's first-class hurricane winds reached 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and it was 385 miles southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a chasm is forming in the Pacific Ocean and moving east and west coasts of the United States, and as Tropical Storm Rosa approaches the Bay California Peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture along with the incoming chasm will create widespread plumes in the southwest over the next few days.
Typically, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in flooding, landslides and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will result in precipitation that will reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to two to four inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible as a result of rapidly deteriorating weather conditions and the typical dispersion of tropical rainfall.
A desert hiking trip would be extremely unthinkable with the danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms in the area with strong winds and sandstorms.
The next trench will bring local splashes to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of over half an inch is possible, which could cause sliding colostrum and spikes.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
A calm, scattered tropical storm will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more extensive later Monday and Tuesday.
The raids will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, there may be major fluctuations in temperatures across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There's a great example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, was nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will try to buy back and expand.
Early October will be warm in most of the central and eastern United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the audition of Bret Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people on Thursday watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with broadcasters suspending regular broadcasts over Friday's latest conspiracy: a deal that Arizona Senator Jeff Blake made with the FBI on a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure he drank Kavanaugh and tried to undress him at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company has been computing viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble getting people to follow the transmissions from the office.
To make it better, it's an audience similar to that of watching a football playoff game or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led the way with an average viewership of 5.69 million during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, they said from Nielsen.
Interest is high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras recorded protesters screaming at him after he tried to get into an elevator to attend a judicial hearing.
He was standing in a frowned-out look for a few minutes while being insulted, with a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he had more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and television networks were broadcasting live hours later as the Judiciary Committee voted to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the Democratic minority is calling for.
Flakea was partly persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview that is on the front page of her daily newspaper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for the UK and the EU to take each other's tariffs is highly absurd.
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyton Simpson, a suspect in the death of an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS's WAFB Channel reports.
After Simpson was questioned, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, his lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department said the credit belongs to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police Department, and the area residents who helped with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement agency for its commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was shocked and saddened by Wayde's death.
"This is what we're always worried about", Wade said.
The volcano is throwing ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been tracking more earthquakes and landslides.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity from the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after independence activists clashed with a special police force when thousands joined counter-demonstrations marking the anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, held by a special police force, threw them eggs and paint in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, they also clashed with police using pendants to quell the fight.
Independents have been chanting for hours, "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and clashing with unionists who have been shouting "Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the region that declared independence a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low as opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting by violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they changed course.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we're in trouble now, he said.
Despite winning a key but close victory in the local elections last December, Catalan independence parties have had difficulty keeping pace with some of their most prominent leaders in self-imposed exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police on the phone, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It's getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European Parliament election.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the impact of democratic values and repression imposed by the Spanish authorities", he said.
Men arrested after they hit a house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after they drove themselves into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 7:30pm British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has stated that the gate and the building itself are damaged.
There's a possibility that at some point, the car was shot from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
The Menge's strike brought Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal ensured a win for Livingston
The upgraded Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only his second loss to Steven Gerrard in 18 games for Ibrox.
Dolly Mengele's goal was key, while Gary Holt's club was tied with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club have not won a single Premier League game this season and will play the top-ranked Heartse who are eight points behind next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid from Vienna in the Europa League game on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended his league winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt hasn't suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against a host who lacked sharpness.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored because their direct play was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt passed by the goal, then Alan Lithgow's attempt passed by the goal after he slipped to pick up the ball that Craig Halkett had his head turned to the goal.
The hosts were obliged to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for the guests from free throws.
And that's how the key goal was scored.
He was given free agency against the Rangers, Livingston made the pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mang, who took the ball and hit from the middle of the penalty area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but the defensive host remained undefeated and goalie Liam Kelly had no problems.
That pattern continued in the second half, though Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped Rangers goalie Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow shot too far from another free throw for Livingston.
The Crowes were constantly coming into Livingston's penalty area and were constantly defended, while the two penalties they had sought after the foul against replacement Glenn Middleton and the other for playing hand were not awarded.
The phenomenal play of Livingstone's analysis
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont is at the Tony MacArony Arena
A phenomenal game and a result by Livingston.
All to one were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on the upward journey.
Their gameplay and players have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the big credit goes to Holt who has been energizing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, leading a highly organized defense, while Meng throughout the game gave up peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at Gerrard's club from time to time, they never got to that level.
They missed the final punches they only broke through the hosts' lines once and this is the kind of wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
A mixed reception for Erdoğan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29) was marked by a smile and blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving NATO allies' relations.
They split on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Kellen to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city with the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposing Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also voiced their condemnation of Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The double protests reflect a split opinion of a guest who some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others dislike him for being an autocrat.
Motorcycle accident in Deptford: Motorcyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the emergency team intervened, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in a crash in which the driver left the crash site, on Childers Street, which is about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
London police said they were working on identifying the victim and informing the family.
Streets are closed, buses redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the riots
Six prison officials were injured in the riots at the high-security prison for men, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British time and are still ongoing.
A special squad of Tornado officers has been called to quell riots involving eight guards in one prison wing.
Officers received fewer facial injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison spokesman said, "We've deployed specially trained prison staff to handle the incident that's taking place at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received medical attention for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and their prison sentences could be extended.
Long Lartin Prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was admitted to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special unit was called to the prison for a serious riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which may be useful in drought-affected areas)
Rarely do tropical depressions hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa uses its remaining energy to pass through the desert southwest, carrying with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will be announced Monday night by rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest projections from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome, Arizona, up to 6 inches.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Basin, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated areas.
In areas where there is no fear of flooding, Rosina's rainfall could be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitation will likely be of use because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Drylands Control Agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by the least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, on its way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a slide on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be crashing at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and it will begin to fade.
So, a tropical storm is expected to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or earlier.
The tides in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a major flood risk.
"Total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Bay California to northwestern Sonora, and perhaps as much as 10 inches", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico in the force of a tropical storm before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main threat expected of Rose or her remnants is heavy downpours in Bay California, the northwestern Sonora and the American Southwest Desert, the National Hurricane Center said.
These flashes are expected to cause life-threatening flooding and landslides in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4am British time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials are calling to call those who have any recordings of the event on their mobile phone.
Trump has stated that Kavanaugh has endured the viciousness and fury of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and unproven tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh endured the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted them decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charges.
The president said Saturday that the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"The confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great public service accomplishments", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly touched upon Kavanaugh's appointment while discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running, he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere.
Trump claims the Democrats are trying to build resistance and disruption.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them picked up by huge waves hitting beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palá on Friday when waves up to 18 feet [6.8 m] high hit the shore at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was announced yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they were killed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster recovery agency, in a speech in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it carried cars, tanks, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at speeds of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palau.
The aerial photographs, released by the Disaster Agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, curved and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shelling continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It's possible that the geographical location of the city, which is located on the edge of a long, narrow bay, increased the tsunami's intensity, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "obscene" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels were demolished.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palua, in Donggala region, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely cut off without any information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting a tsunami hit Paul, although officials said the waves arrived just in time for the warning.
Amateur records shared on social media show a man upstairs who is panicking under the street warning people of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palua, hampering rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for humanitarian flights only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Paluu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has climbed to over 800.
It's really bad.
Although World Vision personnel must have arrived from Donggala in Pal, where employees were housed in tents erected in the backyard of the office, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw many destroyed houses, he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief groups began taking the first steps to mitigate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign highly skilled humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we'll be open to international assistance, but that status hasn't been declared yet.
As the fall falls on the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously rescued and that their story of earthquake in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners at the Ro Ro Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the Ro Ro Ro Hotel's demolition spread to paragliding circles, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palou who were attending the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one grey clutch instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while loading ATMs at the Newport on the Levee complex
On Friday morning, according to a police report in Newport, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who filled a vending machine in Newport on the Levee.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects flee the scene, the statement said, but police did not specify the number of those involved.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changing his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "He will be known previously as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time and used the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where promotion of his new album Yandhi is expected.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande who canceled the show for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
As for the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti,' West said earlier this year as he discussed the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It's from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye  which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without a dash and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody vengeance against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday he would never use the military to defeat the Mexican people.
The military opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government issued announcements about AI, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the field of AI.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: to be the number one AI innovation destination by 2030.
"A double budget for AI would be a good start, considering all other countries are way behind the United States, and we're looking for a new breakthrough in the field of AI", Lee said.
The double-funded funds could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an AI system that proved superior to the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has given credit to earlier U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when they plan to host the next competition to identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to get government grants, Lee said.
"China doesn't take away our academic leaders, it's corporations doing it", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired some great college people in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the United States consolidate its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop a new generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense formed a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence that seeks to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law that has been trying to form the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence for months has been doing nothing.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the state
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents its ownership of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Slav majority in Macedonia.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised the question of whether the referendum would yield the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entering bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us", said Oliver Georgijeva, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have stated that they will be guided by the outcome of the vote and that the outcome will be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there was no report of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when a total of 66 percent of voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe", said Jose Tanevski (62), a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted in a Macedonian referendum on a name change, which could open the way for them to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and pulled chairs outside the tent that were crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor but proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will vote for it because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after inserting the ballots.
He said the result would be the confirmation of our future.
A poll published Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum  which is below the required turnout.
According to a second poll by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote for it.
To make the referendum a success, it takes a turnout of 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to a pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defence of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton in a 2-0 win against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It worked out very easily when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker picked up the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He was running between three of Brighton's defensive players before he found himself in the open.
Aguera was then surrounded by three green jerseys.
He was moving around one defensive player and was faster than a few others on the edge of Brighton naked.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English striker used his first penalty kick to return the ball to Aguero, who hit a right-handed batter to knock out Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a right-handed spin.
Aguero had some foot problems, City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's the way it was.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point.
But Sterling was the one who gave the Skycaps a head start in the Premier League mix.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action Aguero took the ball deep on the Brighton side of the field.
He's added a beautiful Leroy Sane to his left side.
Sanne touched it a couple times before he sent Sterling to the naked.
The sky-high striker threw the ball into the net before it slipped off the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a non-competitive game against the Rockies.
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the playoffs, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to take the position Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still up in the air.
The Rockies have a direct lead on a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win their first league title.
We're not playing for anything, though, if we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level of any other team this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these conditions?
The Nationals still have to announce the starting lineup for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer throw himself into that situation.
Scherzer, who would have been 34th to start the game, trained Thursday and will pitch Sunday when he's usually rested.
The Washington right-hander leads the season with an 18.7 earned run average of 2.53.300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly addressed the situation surrounding the election of his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republicans running for half-term elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones, even though I didn't run, I'm actually a candidate because I fight for great candidates everywhere, he said.
Trump went on, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using every possible means, see the evil, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they trample to get power and control, power and control is what they want, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of opposition and interference.
And you've seen it in the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, mean and dishonest.
He named Democratic senator and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, prompting the public to voice a protest.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting. That was really bad body language. The worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer accepts any differences.
She's intolerant of those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists at my local branch of the party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
I'm the last of a number of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome, all because we've expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors have criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy didn't agree with his previous leaders on.
The notice from the Nottingham East Labour Party's meeting on Friday says we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night meetings were mostly like this.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not that, and the promise of a more loving, gentler policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether that ever has been the case.
It has become increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I believed shared similar political views began to expect me to make a 180-degree turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with, whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak publicly, and it doesn't matter what I say, it's accompanied by a barrage of insults on social media, calls for removal from the party, condemnations of the centre-right politics and tell me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political in nature.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who deal with a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but they don't back down.
One of the things that disappointed me most in this political age was how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different views and with every vote of no confidence or change in the selection rules the party is narrowed.
I've had a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been telling me to shake my head, be less vocal, and then I'll be in the office.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, sparked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government which literally ruined my elementary school, I have sought to advocate for better public services for those most in need, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never covered my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when a country is heading for a Brexit that will threaten our households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand why anyone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that threats of removal from the party or political intrigue will not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won a well-deserved victory in this exciting match of the day in the Tennent's Premier League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the home team won thanks to superior defense, as well as a greater number of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "To all honors, they've taken their chances better than us.
Grant Naderson's 14th-minute attempt to turn Frazier into Clima gave Ayra a lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical lead and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo penalised Ayr's lead before, just before halftime, he managed to turn the solo attempt into a 17:5 lead for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which turned Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was brought on the carrier, and Ayr further increased the lead by the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who turned Clima.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair Macpherson, was then awarded the yellow card, and Melrose re-used his numerical advantage with an unprovoked attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts recovered when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for foul over Clim without the ball.
The Clima has turned, as it has since almost the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch in the penalty area and sent the wing of Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt as host.
The star of the Still Game series is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still game star Ford Kieran is preparing to make the transition to the restaurant industry after learning he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series for which he writes the script and stars alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final, and Kiernan appears to be planning a life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
Bolivia, which has no way out, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The flags of the ocean are flown on public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with slogans:
Returning the sea exit is our duty.
Across mainland Bolivia there is still a strong memory of the coast they lost to Chile in a bloody battle over natural resources in the 19th century  as well as a desire to re-invade the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in recent decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has captured the momentum, in a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course it expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia and the claim that after decades of heinous negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Here's Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin, who is up for re-election next year, also has a big role to play in the verdict that will be handed down on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it does.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was handed down only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was more complicated, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of making progress on the Bolivian case, the last four years may have been a challenge.
"The problem of going to sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian authorities", Zarate said.
Morales' warlike rhetoric has killed the rest of Chile's goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement over mutual satisfaction, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the issue of going to sea as a political stunt.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says it won't disarm until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his people will not abolish nuclear weapons until they trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made at the summit in Singapore between conflicting leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming deadly nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's just a dream come true that continuing sanctions and the US opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism when it comes to Pyongyang's seriousness in renouncing its nuclear arsenal, which that country likely sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion magazines showcased the latest line of huge hats that you'll soon see on the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you've come to the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of huge, unwrapped hats on the tracks of their 2019 spring and summer magazines, overshadowing everything at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have won Instagram this summer, and these designers have been showing off their impressive creations on fashion tracks.
The most prominent Valentine's piece was a over-the-top hat with a wide feathered skirt that swallowed the model's head.
Among the other gigantic additions were a decorative stone skullcap, a witch hat, and even pineapple, but they're not meant to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the yellow masks had wrinkled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One design resembled a diving gear with a distillation mask, and the other resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you're one of those people who's following the trend of attracting attention, you're in luck.
Fashion-focused people predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after the La Bombe, a straw hat with a two-footed rim that has been seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that invented this very impractical hat that flooded social media has sent another big creation to the track -- a straw beach bag that's almost as big as the model that wore it.
A bag of raspberry orange with a white leather brush and a raffin was a highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the big beach hats and bags to hit stores in time for next summer, given the designer's huge footprint it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized fashion accessories".
Knowledge of languages is key to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can boast outstanding academic achievement, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding test results, further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in the society of the world's citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement its own curriculum and curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it's a headache.
If you talk to him in his language, it makes his heart ache.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we are to build good relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Judging by the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received an A on their high school graduation exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A in Mandarin on their high school final exam, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electives, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and in independent school programs, and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 percent of employers cited the lack of foreign-language skills as the reason for job-filing difficulties.
So learning foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs requiring foreign language skills, this skill is essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you know a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future because it is a lifelong skill.
The art of communicating directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 Britons in 2013, 75 percent did not speak a second language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in learning foreign languages is so important to today's children.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children better chances of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to the languages being taught.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important to Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with expert teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing learning environments that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At this time, there's no denying that in the global business environment, languages are key to the future of our country, so that needs to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
I must do it well.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not known how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about plans for six games during the Lakers preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has started a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings next week, including visits to friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat awaits, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When's Trump's concert in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia under the live YouTube feed.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearings on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, which were tense on sexual harassment charges, and the expected Senate vote was postponed by seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the ultimate goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans get a better result in the November election.
So President Trump's campaign said that the rallies are being held this week to give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is such a critical part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to report told Reuters.
Held at the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania together and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will be visiting West Virginia for the second time this month, the state where he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican nominee for Senate in West Virginia, who's not doing well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president came to try to raise his polling ratings", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show a struggle to keep hope before Sunday's individual matches
After three one-way sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon may be just what this Ryder team needed.
Zamah clay is a completely invented concept in sports, but one that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got momentum right now?
"They've scored six points, and now they've scored four, so you could say the momentum is on our side", Jordan Spieth said on the way out.
Europe, of course, has the lead, four points more, with 12 more to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot to encourage them, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points out of four possible.
Spieth was brilliant from first to last and leads by example.
The celebration roar grew louder during his round, to finally play the key punch for the unresolved fourth game when he and Thomas were two after two.
His final blow, which gave them a 15-hole game, was met with a similar cry, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to do your best and take care of your game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story behind the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but irresistible European couple won all four matches and played without a mistake.
Mollywood was the only couple that didn't hit a goddamn punch on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they've shown so far and the way they're exchanging energy with the loud crowd have cemented them as the top favourites on Sunday and there's no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could carry a potential European victory as the sun sets over the Le Golf National grounds.
It's best to have both on different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to talk about a European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he was playing in pairs with Alex Noren.
One divine blow and two double punches in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they were unable to escape.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
Four-ball and four-ball games are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but this session has also shown four times that the US team has a desire to fight that some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final Ryder Cup with a significant lead, having gained a 10-6 lead over the United States after Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
The inspired pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the first with two wins over the unruly Tiger Woods, increasing the previous record at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjørn Europeans in the fight to recover the trophy they lost at Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in the morning four-ball game and won the series 3-1.
The United States provided greater resistance in the tournament with four, winning two games, but could not reduce the lag.
Jim Fury's team must score eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they perfectly combined and beat out a tired Woods and American rookie, Bryson DeCambeau, with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who fought through two games on Saturday, shone for a while, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games in a row with four balls and four shots and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who was resting during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henry Stenson in the Fourth Circuit and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk, first and third in the world.
Europe, however, did not go according to plan on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
Triple-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They fought hard to win 2-1 over John Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, to come back later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in the fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have a team come back after falling behind by four points before a single match, although Furyk's defending title side is still undefeated enough to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, it seems they could not carry out a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says there's no talk of unilateral disarmament unless there's trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday at the United Nations that the extension of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu told the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken significant measures over the past year to show goodwill, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear site and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no corresponding reaction from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no question that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for its gradual steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not dismiss unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea demands a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also deafened to calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is not giving up denuclearization first and foremost, and is increasing the pressure on sanctions to force its goal, even resisting the declaration of an end to war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can get us down on our knees is the dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri didn't mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If we were negotiating this denuclearization issue with South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not come to such an uncomfortable position".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US launch of North Korea's surface-to-air missiles was inevitable after Mr. Trump called Kim "Rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was much more to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't set a timeline for this, saying, "If it's necessary, let it last two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strict and unconditionally enforced until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization is achieved.
The Security Council unanimously endorsed sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Riyadh outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after only a few hours for making gangster demands.
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the appropriate measures required the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a class on how to get enough rest.
This year's new course at Harvard University aims to get students to sleep more in an effort to root out the increasingly popular catchy culture of learning all night with the help of caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the world's leading universities often lack basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the course he believes is the only one of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course came after a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my senior year?
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
This year's first-ever course teaches students the basics of how good sleeping habits contribute to better academic and athletic outcomes and improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after observing that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of a room in a student home, and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sticks, and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, and the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routines.
In the second part, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation may increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We're aware that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe they have the right to know just as you have the right to know what health effects your decision to smoke has on your health", Professor Czeisler said.
A culture of pride about being awake at night is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, and that quality, should be a secret weapon for students in their fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even against overweight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a hunger-free mode, and they're constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czesler design the course after attending one of his lectures last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate for its maintenance on a campus-wide basis.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduates to be required to complete a similar study programme before entering a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider setting an alarm at bedtime and wake up time and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt circadian rhythms, thereby causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: Mengin's goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressing defeat in the guests' game when Dolly Meng shot Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to take their first ever home win since their February 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerrard as manager only his second defeat in 18 games, leaving his side eight points behind the unattainable Ladbrokes Premier League leader, Heart.
Meng hit seven minutes into the half, and the Rangers' uninspired lineup never came close to a tie.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and they're behind Hibernian just because of the goal difference.
The Rangers could face further problems after linebacker Calum Spence had to show up for help when he was thrown from the sidelines with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt has been favoring the same 11 Livingston players who scored last week for the Hearts and would be thrilled with the way his well-trained team has been pushing opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
It was just two minutes before Meng's first-over-the-space goal sent Scott Pittman to Allen McGregor, but the midfielder missed a big shot and kicked a goal.
Keegan Jacobs' deep free kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to walk by the naked end of the statistical line.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should get a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily defended the headstroke from Lassane Coulibaly and took the shot directed at Ovie Eyaria.
Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected a true match-up of strength during the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if for no other reason, then by the effort put in.
The Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' deep free throw again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Mengo for a simple finish.
Gerrard responded to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement almost immediately paid off when the wingman hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to urge the guests to play exactly as they liked, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the lead in the final minutes, but McGregor held up and defended Jacobs' attack, then Lithgow would corner and head the ball to the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson again did not respond.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a passage from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, on this day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually become a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main centers of science, the Geiger counter has a place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crowned Bell", starring the seemingly incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in minerals.
Yeah, that's a lot of fun.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure involves removing immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can see the protein that's common to many types of cancer, and then they're injected again.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer in the ovaries of a woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient, re-treating them in the lab so they can see the HER2 protein, and re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute of Malaria in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 helps the growth of several cancers including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and learning the same way to target malignant cells was effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a strong speech in support of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance on SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was scouted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a lavish performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that night he wore a hat with the words "Make America Great", he insulted the Democrats and spoke again of his support for Trump.
I've talked to white people so many times they've said, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
So if I cared about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon and in which a Hollywood star mocks Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, a video of West's speech was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to make West laugh by putting up the tape.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes with his hat.
I was being stalked behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head".
They've been bugging me!
And then they say I'm a jerk, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that he's going to wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me.
Try love.
His comments sparked a public whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL crew were noticeably affected, Variety reported, while one person who was present said: "The entire studio was silent".
They brought Westa in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of "I Love It" disguised in a bottle of Perry.
Westa was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls:
But host Karen Hunt tweeted that West was simply what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful.
But I choose not to reward someone (such as buying his music or clothes or supporting his intelligence) for whom I believe has embraced and spread an ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
And we are, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to the symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder after a person was stabbed in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in the Ballyhackamore neighborhood, police said.
The accused is expected to appear at the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The star of the Game of Thrones series, Kit Harington has condemned a toxic cat culture.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-smith in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has defied the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such screen roles mean that boys very often feel they need to be rude to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed something went wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of the toxic cat culture in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Leslie Rose, 31, admitted that he has a strong need to address this issue.
"I personally am currently quite troubled by the question of what we did wrong in portraying masculinity", he said.
What do we teach men as they grow up when it's a problem we see now?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading a toxic cat culture by portraying characters who pose as men.
He continued, "What is born, and what is the matter of education?
What is it that we are taught on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they must fit into a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think that's actually one of the major questions of our time. How do we change that?
Because something has obviously gone wrong for the young man.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to previews or sequels of Game of Thrones after its conclusion the following summer, saying that he had "finished off the battlefields and horses".
Kit is set to star in Sam Shepard's play True West from November, telling the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that ever happened to him in the Game of Thrones franchise.
"I met my wife on this show, so you could say she gave me my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love partner of Keith's character Jon Snow in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the previous state.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions of virus-infected people.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a hot issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative views in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus often comes from inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff has released information about Republican senators, condemning dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff posted the personal details of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
A Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles claims these claims are placed by experts and the website of the ultra-industrial wing.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information went online Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate Committee on Sexual Harassment Hearings against Supreme Court Justice candidate Bret Kavanaugh.
The information came out at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and posted information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and inaccurate claims is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement soon sparked a web-based condemnation, which was also issued by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is a rage", wrote Fleischer.
This leads to the conclusion that she doesn't have the temperament needed for a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He can't be bold.
He can't question the prosecution's motives.
They must be calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also announced himself on Twitter.
"A big deal, if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the relevant authorities and judicial authorities of these false claims.
We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and that they are accountable to the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all my staff members.
Johnny English is back in action.
It has become a tradition to seek a subtitle on Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can be applied to this sequel to the satirical action comedy franchise about Johnny English which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to the screen in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Will the ironic auto-statement about how obviously useless we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, the boisterous, incompetent Johnny English rubber face has been given a new opportunity to break something  with his name more than anything suggesting that it is a general comic creation designed for territories with a cinema audience whose English is not their native language.
It's, of course, about a silly secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, a Mr. Bean trunk and the crumb of the guy who played just one note as part of the theme tune of the Charity of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It's also based on the traveler and international man wrapped in a veil of secrets Atkinson once starred in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest JE ventures are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knightly armor and when the rotor knives briefly hung on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and strangely overwhelming, especially now that serious movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible confidently add comedic elements.
I bet it's a child's humor, not an adult's, and for me Johnny English's spoiled adventures aren't as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent film gags like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very topical issue that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated a British top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an agent on duty, unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final drop in a full glass of water for the prime minister, a pompous and stubborn figure who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character modeled after Theresa May, but the scenario is pretty poor.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies are compromised and that she will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the spoiled Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a fine institution, but unofficially teaches lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting geeks when English holds a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
The English are quickly sent back to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to reunite him with his former immensely patient partner Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role of Vicki Pepperdine is little spent.
So Batman and Robin for spoiling things are back at the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and fortunately the beautiful fatalistic wife Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of comedic adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, real chaos crushes by boarding a luxury yacht on Volta, and English sets off a real anarchy by trying to get to know the interior of Volta's house using virtual reality headphones.
It's obvious that a lot of effort has been put into that last sequence, but as nice and cheerful as it was, the whole film seems to be made for kids.
Pretty mediocre quality.
As with other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry conceive of any role for Rowan Atkinson that would really showcase his talent?
Labour denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week but be paid five.
The party is reportedly seeking to get the company's bosses to pass on the time they save thanks to the AI revolution by giving them another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend like this but still get the same salary.
Sources say that this idea would fit into the party's economic agenda and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The shift to a four-day work week was approved by the union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy in general.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not the party's policy and the party does not consider it.
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of the dirty executives and the profiteers in the utilities.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not be able to recoup their entire investments because Labour could impose fines based on perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10 percent of the value of private sector companies to employees who are likely to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy talk for the 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and is withdrawing the question of whether the bureau's investigation could prompt some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I think, of course, Kennedy said.
Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, I asked him if you did it.
He was unshakable, determined, unambiguous.
But Senator Graham's voice seems to be cemented.
"My opinion of Bret Kavanaugh is well formed and would require a strong indictment", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett energetically denied it, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whoever she names can't confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the World Citizens' Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal of ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the large lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true purpose of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that advocates for ending poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a number of tasks or tasks, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, a phone call and any other meaningful way to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Citizen of the World project with only 12 years left to achieve its goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to get people to do something, or is it just another form of so-called "clicktivism" when people believe they've done something that will change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Citizens of the World initiative claims to have recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters who have committed to a range of different goals.
They say these actions have prompted world leaders to announce promises and policy directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 promises and announcements resulting from its shares, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already directly impacted 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises were the Food Power, a partnership of investors and UK realtors who pledged to help children grow to their full potential, pledging that Rwanda would allocate $35 million to help end malnutrition in that country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historic occurrence", Food Authority Ambassador Tracey Ullman told live concert guests in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Food project, whose interventions will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website that reads, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world says, "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we'll fall and we'll get dirty.
However, like all the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States Navy could block Russia's energy exports.
Washington can use its navy as necessary to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claims that Russian involvement in Syria is a legitimate government call, an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe and central Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States has the option to, along with our navy, ensure that the sea corridors remain open or block them as necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market", he said.
Zinka was speaking to the attendees at an event organized by the Energy Consumers' Union, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared the approach of Washington to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less fuel-use and fuel-supply", he said, saying that Russia has only one asset, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements come after the Trump administration's mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which represents a far more favorable option for European consumers.
To that end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin the "princess" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion and is to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economic in nature and that this represents an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of putting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, said a Massachusetts state senator.
Massachusetts state senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the next midterm election.
During a meeting at Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, quoted by The Hill as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren summoned President Donald Trump during a meeting at City Hall, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was called in for criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet posted on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, the results of the poll released Thursday showed that the majority of the electorate that voted for Warren did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters who are likely to vote in Massachusetts said a senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed there was greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidacy and 48 percent against the candidacy.
Other noisy names from the Democratic ranks that have been discussed in terms of their potential 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin was speaking about PTSD at the Trump Support Meeting.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence following an incident that occurred Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, I can relate to what is happening to other families suffering from PTSD and the vulnerabilities our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a support rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "hot topic", and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, she added, "they come back a little different, they come back stronger, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military have given for this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - assaulting a woman, obstructing reporting of domestic violence and possession of an opioid-powered weapon, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a review of the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friendly report Friday in Washington to the court to provide support to asylum seekers challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal police has not been released.
She said she was abused by her partner and violent gang members, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace have explained how the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, face a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney for the District of Columbia, General Carl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is overlooking decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and that the Chamber thus violates that principle", the friendly report states.
Lawyers further claim in the report that the police who block immigrants from entering the country are harming the U.S. economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and secure the necessary workforce".
State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant-related cases in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is only available to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion", Sessions said in a statement on June 11, referring to politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palos as the death toll doubles in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
'It's very tense,' said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palau.
Every minute, the EMTs bring in the bodies.
The government is running out of clean water".
Residents are returning to their broken homes, searching for flooded things trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were flooded.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harris, with broken back and shoulders, are being placed outside the Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continuing strong aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he tells how he felt a powerful earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
The US ambassador accuses China of using propaganda propaganda to commit violence.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid addition of the Chinese newspaper China Daily to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election marks, US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
And while it's common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war where each other is raising tariffs on imports.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were targeted at exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime mayor of Iowa, which is China's top exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brannstad wrote in a commentary published in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, is now doubling that violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the precious American tradition of free speech and press freedom by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's troubled economic path, given that the Chinese media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was referring to.
Republicans are turning women away from voting ahead of midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn.
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans who stand with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, will experience negative reactions, particularly women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue are very intense and most Republicans are already showing that they want to give their vote.
There's no turning back on these things", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said in a magazine article published Saturday.
Reeher said he suspects that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute request for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to press ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous", Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news.
People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among indecisive female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, while not liking the president, don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed the alleged sexual assault charges against a Supreme Court justice candidate, analysts were of the opinion that there could be a negative reaction if Republicans persisted with the nomination.
"This has become a big mess for the old Big Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this issue and how they've been dealing with it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic-elected group, told the news channel.
Yet it seems that Americans are somewhat divided as to who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, while slightly leaning toward Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought the same about Ford.
Following the Flack initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who made the charge, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claims that a Supreme Court justice candidate showed her her genitals while attending parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solida technology to allow people to create their own 'personal online data store' or POD.
It may contain a contact list, a list of duties, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of them are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about a personal online store is that it's entirely up to the user who can access what types of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to provide the resources, processes and skills necessary to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, a number of employed development engineers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology engineers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to implement a complete change where all their business models overnight will be completely destroyed.
We don't ask their permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new Web built on Solid".
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross awarded to a World War I priest
A celebration in honour of the only Anglican priest to be decorated with the Victoria Cross as a World War I combatant was stabbed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won recognition on September 29, 1918 for the attack on the towns of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had won Britain's greatest military recognition.
At a parade held Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren uncovered a memorial plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award for his exploits.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from the battlefield and machine gun fire".
Later he rushed to the line of fire and with the greatest heroism he led the tide before, without any help, he rushed to the Polish cannon and killed three men from the army.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's moves were something I knew I could never achieve, but also something that challenged obedience".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be part of the parade and added that the bravery of a true hero shows the support that many will give.
MMA fans who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that, you stayed up all night watching the Bellator 206 series of matches, which ultimately prevented you from watching the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main list and was broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, just as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were left shocked when the broadcast of Peppa Pig was interrupted.
Many were not impressed at all that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning precisely because of the fight.
One fan on Twitter described this cartoon cut as a kind of sick joke".
"It's a government regulation that says at 6 a.m. that content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peace Pigs", yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I talk about reprizing, I think we can probably solve it", Coker said.
But the transmission is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to do anything until Sunday when they're already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the break-up came, there were letters circling and everything was hostile.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical fault.
But it wasn't. It was a matter for the government.
I can promise you, it won't happen again.
We're gonna cut the number of fights from six to five, like we usually do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that it was only in high school that he realized that everyone was like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs broadcast hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others a chance".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the program, Kirsty Young, was away for several months due to illness.
Appearing as a villain on the first Laverne show, Daley said that growing up he felt "less valuable than others because it was more socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "Until today, those feelings of inferiority and feeling different were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was somebody", he said, so people wouldn't be disappointed when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others hope".
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him, and he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much when you're so young" - he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - said it's hard to find someone his age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple performed as the parents of the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his overall perspective had changed.
If you asked me last year, it was just about me winning the gold medal, he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to sit in the front row, Dad, he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
'I just knew that this was what I'd dreamed of my whole life - to swim in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,' he said.
It served as the inspiration for his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated in him as he prepared for the Olympics and which is still sung by the crowds.

Mickelson's out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape so this isn't a bumpy ride.
Mickelson, playing in the record-breaking 12th Biennale, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday with four balls and four games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time major winner spent the day cheering and improving the range in the game, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the peak of his career, is not the ideal choice for the demanding course of Le Golf National, where a long, uneven course regularly punishes stray strokes.
And if the pitch itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has won all four of their games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 games four points short, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk said he had faith in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he'd be ready by tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's very confident in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I never imagined he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how it worked, and we thought that's how it had to work.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Fold's record for Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time losses, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team", he explained.
I think it was fun for the younger players to give him a chance, and this week, it was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage on the final day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his first appearance in a game in the city of Walderram in 1997, when the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a narrow margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You're constantly remembering that we had a big lead at Walderra, we had a big lead at Brooklyn where we lost, and at Walderra where we won", Bjorn said, imagining after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history and everyone on that team will show me this isn't over.
Tomorrow you're going to finish.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and that's what the focus is.
I'm talking all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's across the road on the other side -- the biggest players in the world".
Enthusiastic about his players' performances in a tough golf tournament, Byrne added: "I would never let this carry me.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's the next game, and that's another thing.
It's great to be there with your partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're testing your ultimate potential as a golfer.
That's the message you have to get to the players - give your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he's also gonna have to do his best".
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better singles than they did in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Suryk himself was on both ends of those big upsets on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed a miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, encouraged his players before the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but you should strive to get a great start like what you saw in Brooklyn, like what you saw in Medina.
When he starts with that kind of a lead, he puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We've formed our set accordingly and we've prepared the guys so we'll try to perform some magic tomorrow, you know.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead a counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half.
"I've been with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover it all", Bjorn said of selecting singles players.
New German warship again on hold
The new German Navy frigate was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but will not arrive in at least another year due to system failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a spokesman for the army.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class naval ships ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years without returning to the home port.
Still, the permanent delays mean that the most modern warships, which were supposed to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will be outdated by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of key software and hardware flaws that would render the ship unusable if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be manned by a crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half the number of people who operated the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was significantly overweight, reducing its impact and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including training staff, also becomes problematic.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy actually has deployable ships".
The official said that this problem has grown over time because old ships have been written off, not replacement ships purchased.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide to future conservation activities.
A study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bat and the species Pipistrelle, and the brown long-tailed bat and the Daubenton bat in the Inverview Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be installed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
A thorough analysis of the recordings of all the records will determine the frequency of bat calls and what species they do.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows, and which is the best way to maintain forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which negatively affects the bed and the loss of housing.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bat's not really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained specialists who regularly perform checks, bed inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a large bat area here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good housing.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of checking for bats on the property, since it is possible that accidental destruction of one mother's litter could kill up to 400 females and young people, likely leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and are prohibited by law from killing, harassing, harassing, or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to get involved and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the populations of most of our species evolve".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers file a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations made against him as "fake news", saying that people wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the charges.
A Portugal and Juventus attacker has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Addressing his 142 million followers in a video on Instagram Live, hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports, calling them fake news.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today, it's fake news", said the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal. I know.
They want to make a name for themselves by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have called "unwarranted reporting on privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for the non-material damage in an amount that matches the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her he was a 99% good guy who was let down by those 1%
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that he was a volunteer.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to a settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she's now seeking a settlement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing carmakers
The UK will "always regret" losing its status as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" what Toyota UK had told the BBC - if Britain left the EU without a deal to temporarily halt production at its Burnston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delays in the event that Bexit remains without a deal could cause job losses.
The Burnston factory that makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis produced close to 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March we will see production at our factory shut down", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnston.
Other UK manufacturers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers call the risks in the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates on a 'just in time' basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border disruption which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.
"We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success we have now, but to seize this opportunity", he said on today's BBC Radio 4 programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely capable of continuing what has been an extremely successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but it warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness in the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for 24 years at Burnston and is the chairman of the Unite union factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when jobs like this close, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We must present a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week" as the battle continues over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian election meddling, the ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential miscarriages of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby threaten Mr. Mueller's independence, has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein also discussed the sounding to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of a presidential change under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has rejected these rumors.
But last Monday, he was at the White House amid rumors that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he'd like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a tie-up with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further postponing the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for this has not yet been set, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the other things happening with regard to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press to be kept informed.
Some journalists would dismiss this claim: Sanders has not given a brief press conference at the White House since September 10.
Principal Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the smaller number of short talks was not the result of the refusal to view the theatrical behavior of TV journalists, although she said, "I'll agree with the fact that they're exaggerating".
Then she said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be strengthened.
"The president holds more questions-and-answer sessions than any president before him", she said without providing any evidence.
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this as much as possible, and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these conversations with the president of the United States will replace brief press conferences".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during official visits.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why by acting unrelentingly and occasionally oddly in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Secretary of Health is writing to EU workers employed by Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) about fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU employees working for the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and their wish to remain post-Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jean Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimburse the costs of resolving the status requirements for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued over the summer, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a very, very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after injuring his head in Saturday's 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ has reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the line of scrimmage and just crashed there", Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on the carrier and taking him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the type/size of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in red, is playing his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total rainfall Saturday before he left the game, bringing his total to 18 rainfall this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes for buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds used to help the homeless under the new Conservatives' plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to non-payers of UK taxes
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes on their UK property purchases, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn by trying to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those earning more.
Higher taxes will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money to strengthen the government's intention to fight sleeping outdoors.
The additional fee, which, in addition to the existing tax, including the multiple levels, introduced two years ago on other property and purchase for rent, could amount to as much as 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to increase revenue to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not reside in the UK, which causes prices to rise, and it becomes more difficult for first-time buyers to become homeowners.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused construction firms of keeping high property prices by buying land they do not use on their first visit, and asked Mrs May to waive the affordable housing quota as soon as possible to end the British housing policy disgrace".
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and a halt to evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that the lives of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses as easily as valuable British people.
The dream of owning a house has become too far-fetched for many people, and inhuman sleeping outdoors is still very real".
My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to manage the Scotland national team at some point.
Forty-two-year-old Scott is enjoying the challenge of returning to life at the Northeast club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points short of the lead.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was on the B-team and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always pulled me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be offered if I were successful in leading the club".
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sanderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel uneasy coming after such big names to such big clubs after he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The measure of my success at this point will be whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
Judging by the structure and capabilities of this club, he is undoubtedly a Premier League member", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only be considered successful if I can get the club back to where it belongs.
Ross is only in his third year as manager, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the Hartt coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-tier fall, and St Mirren pulled from the bottom of the league to the championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he's now more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
It was probably a real crossroads, remembering the takeover of the Alloa Club.
I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
Sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I earned decently, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to be in management, and now I'm in management, and I've never felt more comfortable in my entire adult life than I do now".

The perfect time to have a drink is Saturday at 5:30, research reveals.
The summer heat wave increased the traffic of British pubs struggling to survive, but it increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
The pubs and bars group saw sales grow by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy CGA, which collected the data, said: "The extremely sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup has contributed to July following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when pubs grew by 2.8%, and restaurants had an even greater decline.
The drop in restaurant traffic of 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks performed far better with higher growth compared to the previous period than was the drop in restaurant traffic.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Pubs and bars saw a 6.6% increase in beverage sales in a month, with food sales down 3%.
Paul Newman, of the Entertainment Content and Hospitality Analysis Agency RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain key factors when it comes to selling in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8% annually will be particularly painful with the already present price pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused guests, and the weather will show if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a little too much of a relief.
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slower introduction of new brand growth.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales tracking service for the UK bar, pub and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data for 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is an accepted industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, research shows.
A survey of over 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of fake Instagram sites
That news has increased the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a headline account showing their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, makes social media posts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a sharp rise in Instagram accounts, which relate to the Instagram photo sharing page.
That news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean headline account showing their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who came across a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who was calling others "Rape me".
A survey conducted by Digital Consciousness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private tasks.
HMC president Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create an Internet space where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athlete at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of that governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's highest-paid athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her rich experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect from the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her board membership", Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won a total of four Olympic golds, including 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and is now a regular expert on the BBC, remained immobile after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time can tell if I'll recover and how much.
It's been a hard job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An advertisement for a traitor comparing mothers to cows shared opinions on the Internet
A company that produces cheaters has shared opinions on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding to cow muzzles.
To mark the launch of a product that has been described as the first silent traitor, consumer technology firm Elvie has released an ad inspired by a fun music video that shows the freedom the new pump provides to mothers who betray milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn among the hay and cows with a song that says, "Yes, I can, but I don't have a tail". And "If you haven't noticed, but it's not in the wind, it's my breasts".
The next line is, "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, I'm husbanding myself".
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the dairy industry.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and give birth like we do to produce milk, but they have their babies taken away a few days after birth, someone wrote.
The Elvie betrayal pump discreetly stands in the Elvie/Mother bra
Another commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a traitor to mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added, "Reports that make no sense".
Others stood up in defense of the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "Hellbound".
I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I were still breastfeeding.
Betrayal made me feel like a cow.
The commercials are a little silly, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product, someone wrote it.
Another commented: "This is a ridiculous ad aimed at mothers who are betraying their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like they are "crabs".
This is not a commercial that boasts or downplays the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discrete pumps hidden in their braces.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who give up milk say they feel like cows.
However, the pump Elvie is completely stationary, with no wires or tubes and it stands in the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while delivering milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and chief creative officer at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing the parallels between milk and cow milk we wanted to focus on milk production and all the challenges that come with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the track at the Martha Jakubowska creation using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children held in custody has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to find a child caregiver.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were undocumented migrants who feared risking their ability to stay in the country by going out to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and share those data with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, told Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted before.
Nearly 80% of people who are either caregivers or members of the caregiver household are illegal in this country, and a good portion of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're going to continue the search for these people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the procedure, officials have introduced new rules that some of the children will have to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the reception workers.
Many will come by video call instead of in person to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those found not to meet the conditions will be deported promptly.
The longer children are locked up, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to anger outbursts or attempted escape, according to hospitality workers and reports that have come in from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that such risks are higher in larger institutions such as the one in the city of Tornillo, where it is much easier to overlook signs that a child is having problems because of its size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without having enough time to prepare emotionally or to say hello to friends can cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in that country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegal in the Syrian land under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they would be treated appropriately.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight the world until we eradicate all Syrian terrorists, including terrorist groups and all foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly in charge of training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns possible", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has thwarted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and al-Qaeda-linked Nusra fighters, who would be wiped out.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of the government and opposition members soon to draft a constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government to participate in the committee's work, saying that the body's work should be limited to the consideration of members of the current constitution and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why will Trump be re-elected for a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his impeachment and scandal ended his term earlier.
That would undoubtedly represent the most dramatic end of a presidential term of all time!
There's no sign of viewer fatigue so far.
Since 2014, the ratings on the hit date have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers per week, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show surpassed the cable channel's ratings with 3.5 million viewers per week.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama "Survivors of Choice", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Just Funny Parts: and a few harsh truths about being inducted into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of abortion law from Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and what the state of the global economy will be like.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than the general knowledge when you realize that you spent six hours watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the sources of deep background for his book Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth of leather jacket and the implications of the pictorial descriptions, this, the anatomy, of Mr. Trump given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mary with the same eyes again.
"What makes it a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show, commenting on the rotation of the cast and the daily intricacies of Trump's show (criticism of the American Football League, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home on the north shore of Kauai Island, it was sunny with temperatures of about 27 degrees Celsius, but he closed himself in and watched MSNBC and was simultaneously filming CNN.
He couldn't get away from the screen, not until Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future on the Supreme Court was uncertain.
I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Big money from the outside in the most unfathomable midterm race for the House of Representatives.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistricting of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
The recent boundary dispute in suburban Pittsburgh led to the election of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who took over the second district after a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against the other incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which overlaps greatly with the new 17th District.
The charts were redistributed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th District has sparked a campaign funding battle between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a widely viewed special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States is considering sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdraws
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with some encouragement from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties are only for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly hit this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a continuation of a similar rally last year that marked a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants into the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the administration's emphasis on the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Mr. Bolton's behalf declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
The story
Next in line could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has significant evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller has also reportedly directed his investigation to uncover a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's election campaign.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to step before the voters again, and perhaps the jury.
There's a lot of quiet and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall, or those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only for the West to oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing more such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a position of uncertainty since this paper reported last year that he had proposed secretly filming the president and speculating that he was unfit to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
How will we react if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or honest, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite compelling sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will fall asleep in a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I am ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on that table with the muddy cross.
With such a legacy, how can we not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers hosted the Rapids from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive rematch in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a good position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented a senior Graham Dorrance from making his debut this season until an unresolved match with Vilareal ended 2-2, but he was convinced that the Rangers could use that result as a springboard for the future.
"It was a worthwhile point for us because Villareal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We came into the game believing we could accomplish something and we went with the score.
We might have been able to take them all the way, but overall, the outcome is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and we were better.
We're having another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result last game, although with the support of the audience we can definitely push and get a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly a tough one, starting with everything that happened with my injuries and going on to the changes at the club itself, but now we're content with what we have right now.
The team's in good shape and the guys are really enjoying it; we're training well.
I hope we can move on now, leave the past season behind and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of worry about saving for retirement
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few of them discussed this with their family members.
About half of the people surveyed by Nationwide said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% said they'd talked to their children about it.
"People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you unless you express your wishes beforehand.
Work with your counselor and family to consider where and how to get it, as such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own savings  provided you have enough money.
Set your legal documents straight: At the root, prevent legal battles.
Make a decision-making authorisation for medical care so that you have an authorised trusted person to oversee the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare workers act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider the conclusion of a financial aid agreement.
This means choosing a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to pay your bills if you become impotent.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is being transported to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Please include details in the written plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are", Martin asked.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it out.
A man shot multiple times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with multiple air rifle shots as he walked home from an evening outing.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 British Summer Time, as a "number-only act".
Victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to testify.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As the connection was cut off, aid officials could not get any information from Donggala Province, an area north of Palua that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palua, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches along more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture form the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that swept over the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the building collapse.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reporting of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police Agency.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention facility and is being given a $500 probation, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday where, on the question of a guilty plea, he stated that he was "certainly not guilty", the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that Palina has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state that were linked to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There have been disconnections and power outages, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located directly along the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami swept the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare death sentence for a federal crime in the state not carried out since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists who found themselves on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip deliberately killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points are possible for the death penalty to be imposed, the court documents state.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and counts of assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required significant planning and premeditation, prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as vile, cruel and corrupt.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrell Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucca, the plea bargain states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the southern district of New York last had a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing the Saipov, has said they are visibly disappointed in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting life in prison without the possibility of parole for a guilty plea, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to issue the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says that Nigel Farrage should be in charge of negotiating Brexit.
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize the People's Army today during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to feel the displeasure of Eurosceptics, as one of MEPs, Therese May, suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have come out so far if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in trying to unite her deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who advocate staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan from Chequerce despite attacks by both supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
Allies insisted she continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and Chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the meeting that leaving means going to Solihull that he wants to give up Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must throw out the Chequers".
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We have not fought in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to bring our laws into our country.
Mr Bone rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely incorrect".
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also at the rally, told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please reject the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a sharp message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to feel dissatisfaction if they are prepared to disappoint the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about trust between us - the people and our political elite", he said.
They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that you're not gonna get away with it.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel dissatisfied.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Resistance marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in downtown.
Several activists have been floating with anti-Brexit banners after forming the group this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis has been mocking the Conservatives for the security issues they had with the party's app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the plan for Canada plus plus, for the unimpeded border situation, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's all a complete farce.
A good Brexit is not possible, he added.
Warren is planning to "seriously consider" running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts native spoke about her future during a participation meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran again for re-election in November against House Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th election meeting using a participatory format of the meeting since Trump took office.
One of the people in the audience asked if she was planning on running for president.
Warren has said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the head.
Arrest after the shooting of LSU's Sims.
Baton Rouge, LA, police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. at a press conference.
A video of the shooting was released Friday, asking for help finding the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died", Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wayde got involved to defend his friend and Simpson hit him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene of the crime, to having a weapon, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge County Sheriff's Office.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 hits and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the order ensures him a victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the order of teams would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel was the first to go to boxing and left Hamilton behind to join the traffic on the start line, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel by wheel which unintentionally forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free with the risk of falling behind after a double move in the third lap defense.
Max Verstappen started from the bottom of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race relying on his tyres to reach the fastest finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally got to boxing in round 44, but failed to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a rough day because Walter's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman letting me through.
The team did a really great job of getting one or two training finishes", Hamilton said.
That was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not released a letter to Christine Blasey Ford in which Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh was accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad, wicked and lying".
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and hellish and lying, he said.
When you look at the ads and the information that went public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you released the information to the public?
You remember her answer... did you release the document to the public-- "what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't let it go public.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't, he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which went public in early September - though Feinstein denied that the information had leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story to the public. " Feinstein told the board, reports Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, just as she asked".
But her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who commented at a rally Saturday night, "Let me tell you, that was really a bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of a Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president insinuated that Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the anger, the rage, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get to power and control, the media is carrying the president's words.
The Dundee Stars and the Belfast Giants, 5 to 3.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have been redeemed for their defeat of the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5-3 win in a replay match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had a two-goal lead from the start with Patrick Dwayne and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer reclaimed the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lunwald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for the Adam Keeff team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won their last three games.
Dwayer opened the game with a quarterback, 3:35, assisted by Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the crowd at the start, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie in the tie at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer led the Giants by the first half with a second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard led them to another tie in the strength-forward goal-scoring in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles jointly helped Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored a fifth goal in the mid-final period to secure his team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are expecting Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board the plane escaped the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller declared a hero after he died ensuring the safe flight of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died, and many are believed to be missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palua.
Despite his colleagues running away trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palou airport which was raging.
He stayed to ensure the safe flight of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
When he realized the control tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palua.
"Our hearts are breaking with this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are scrambling to increase the death toll to thousands, while the state disaster relief agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies remain under the rubble and many are not reachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six meters high have devastated the palace where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Emergency vehicles are bringing bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working diligently to provide relief to survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Pala on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work full-time on all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by a massive earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that after the plane crashed in the lagoon, one person is listed as missing.
The airline whose plane crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person is being treated as missing after earlier stating that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they have been unable to track the passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline said six more passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the fall and what the exact sequence of events was.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses think the plane went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to break through the emergency exit through water that reached their rope on the sinking plane.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to repair the harbor also helped rescue the passengers by using a blasting boat that carried them to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were involving Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday completed a case in a retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He testified before a jury that he used cell phone data to take a motion picture of the defendant Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phone calls indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford stated that he "bellied because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records showed they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted her messages, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He erased her from his life", Hale declared.
The defense should start with the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury trial to follow later in the day.
What is enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when it dealt with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and restore popularity to conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Common are gaining popularity in the UK again through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for breaking up after a racist text message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for termination on a discriminatory basis after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "just another black person".
The couple denies they're racist, calling the lawsuit a "death scare".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when, upon arriving on her first day of work in 2016, she realized that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"I'm not a single black woman anymore", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she became aware of her stupidity, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job poorly and expected a Filipino instead, reports The New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal, as well as compensation in the amount of $350 a day for six months, on which she was originally committed to living with her family, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, you see, you can't do that kind of thing", she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations of racism that it was reasonable to cancel Mauricia's engagement because they feared that after insulting her they would not be able to believe her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, " he told Post's husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you trust your children with someone you've offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Let's go.
Qualifying the lawsuit as "excitement", Plasco said his wife had only been given two months of maternity leave and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
That's not very nice, "added the investment banker.
Although the court proceedings are still ongoing, the public court has been quick to condemn social media money, criticizing it for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers were worried that readers would not identify with the talking bear, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success.
Saying that her father, who, before being inspired to write a children's book by a little teddy bear, worked for the BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work were rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with both happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She also added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like your child accomplished something and you're proud of him, even though it's not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the product of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye over the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Hope called regularly to say that he was ill, and that they didn't expect him to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did that, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications her doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and stopped flowing through her bloodstream.
She died just moments before that and everything went out.
I could just sit back and wait, knowing what was coming next.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be cleaned up.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had never dreamed of the ordeal she had been through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I bowed my head, and tears were continually flowing down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed with compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The distressed women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes are putting up cards on the Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious laugh.
"Everybody knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would taint every room.
However, before his death, he left the job because he was in a very dark phase.
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that it will leave consequences.
Mrs. Davis invented these cards so people would know that there is someone you can talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit and be silent - talk.
Mrs. Humpreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was unmooded, depressed or anything", she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at the bottom of the Christmas tree - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything else.
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to cope: "It leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what's pissing us off.
But we'll keep going and fight.

With the FBI's investigation open, the future of Bret Kavanaugh is uncertain.
"I thought that if we really managed to pull something out of what he was asking for - a limited-scale investigation - maybe it would unite us somewhat", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was concerned the committee was "crumbling down" because of irreconcilable party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their nausea is caused by the choice of moment.
The congressional elections are in just five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans go badly, as expected, their attempts to get elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously undermined.
George W. Bush on Saturday called the Senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI draws up its report?
It's going to be voted on in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to vote to confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean escapees is falling under Kim.
The number of North Korean-South Korean flights has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 flights were recorded last year compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said the two key factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean nationals have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This follows a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where a wider consensus was reached to work on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not considered that we are the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves", RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he was unfit for service on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for service on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman who ever behaves like this would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and hugging when he talked about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, criticizing allegations against him of a "grotesque and orchestrated assault on his personality" organized by liberals angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself by such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House, Pelosi backed down.
"I'll say the following-- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not just fit to be in the Supreme Court, but in the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible verdict against the Affordable Care Act or in the case of Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, biased person to stand trial and be expected to say 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justified anger, anger that has been building up for months and years, and she can't handle it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued, "I've been a lot helped by a woman who was CEO somewhere, and who said she cries when she's angry, but that she developed a technique that means that when she gets angry and starts crying, the person she's talking to says, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you.
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great.
Tears are a permissible way to vent anger in part because they're basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in a mostly male office, is that once, when I was crying out of unspeakable anger, an elderly woman - a cold boss who I was always a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"I never let them see me cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
When Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on the Moneky Business in 1987 and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"That wasn't a well thought out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was already delayed, she lagged behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger at chauvinism -- that it stuck to her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown, Mrs. Schroeder remembered how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what's he gonna put on my memorial?
She cried?
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The first cannons of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the end of the battle is not yet in sight, the rift between the countries may be of benefit to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest hit came this week with new tariffs hitting items worth $200 billion, which tax virtually half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has responded with the same measure every time, with the latest introduction of tariffs of five to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that the United States will respond with the same measure, and the world's second-largest economy does not seem to be stopping anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means meeting demands, but publicly addressing the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing makes its next move well, U.S. concessions in the trade war could in the long run positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of a sharp economic downturn in either of those countries is actually far more dangerous than observers believed", said Abigail Grace, a researcher with Asia as the focus of the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is "ready for the return of refugees", the foreign minister says.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the war that has been raging for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed at their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouallem said the Syrian regime would be well served by help rebuilding the ruined country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight European Championships and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling throughout the tournament, threw the ball into the water with his first kick at hole 16 par 3, leaving the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Throborn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player on the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have been the last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the all-time leading European tournament winner with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we've won the cup again.
"There's a very important team here and I'm glad I could be of help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
The staff is handing over to his compatriot John Ramm who defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 major titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find their way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tonya Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we were giving up on Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to have been their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're upgraded.
