She didn't like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do as you like.
That man you saw yesterday is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf in the rain.
What kind of test is this?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it's good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
The teacher teaches.
What do you see in him?
What do you see?
It's not what you think!
You can buy a dog at that store.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yeah, two.
They're not helping.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later, we're all going to die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is beautiful.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
I guess not.
I want it too!
She looks but she doesn't see anything.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I failed.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand is too simple to create a mind to understand.
We didn't have to rush.
Please?
It doesn't matter which team wins the game.
He's running away.
This dress is too big for me.
Get out of the car and get to your car.
Bring her a plate of salads.
We're at war.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wants a divorce.
Is this a hedgehog or a weasel?
Dad's coming home tomorrow.
This mountain is covered in snow all year round.
Never give up hope.
Can you pass the salt?
This book belongs to the library.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
When I was in high school, I got up at six every morning.
You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say that?
Be careful!
You've obviously done this before.
Did you get the letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
It's your fault.
She turned down my request.
Which one do you prefer?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing in here.
You never know what's gonna happen in the future.
We make cookies in the shape of squirrels.
Everybody likes dolls.
What did you do to deserve this?
Look at the example given above.
Her hat looked very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come at nine?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't had his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why are you here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't still here right now?
Millions of people lost their lives in the war.
Compare your sentence with the one on the board.
She was happy to meet him.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's happening to me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Do not expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he was saying.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your seat.
Be friendly.
Isn't this a beautiful morning?
At least that's the story.
I'm getting more and more gray hair.
He turned off the lights.
I'm not sleepy.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell and couldn't get up.
They fell asleep after the movie.
You can use my dictionary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
Tom likes you.
He rarely stays home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom started to cry for help.
His son is eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
What time did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go now. We're going to have lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old man without a heart.
Eat your bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Tom can't speak English.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women change the world.
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the floor.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The smell of roses filled the room.
Evil sometimes wins.
Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
It's your fault.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?
Apples are the sweetest on the other side of the wall.
What's that?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
It had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a serpent.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it doesn't rain, then we're going.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France for the holidays.
You can sit anywhere you want.
You're an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
At least that's history.
Do you play any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about lives here.
Please, just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to friends.
All your cats are gray.
I still remember the days when you and I went on field trips together.
When we go to bed, we say "good night".
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complicated individuals.
He was so poor that he could not even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know that I know.
Be home by six.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit up the room.
I'm sorry about that.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in the letter?
The woman is eating bread.
I'm eating an apple.
A lonely person takes pleasure in observing ants.
Who is that man at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
I'm really tired now.
His steps accelerated.
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take off your hat when you enter the classroom.
They're not doing anything anymore. They're just complaining.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
Tom got up at seven.
This is for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza by himself.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need to be patient, Tom.
How are you doing?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you've been.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't miss the bus.
All the apples are there.
You'll have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new locker room.
Everyone knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where in Turkey do you live?
Tom disappeared.
I can't. I can't.
Get out of class.
There are three dogs sleeping on my mother's carpet.
Tom has already finished the work he needed to do.
If you can't have children, you could always adopt.
That's what I was thinking.
She ran as fast as she could, but she still couldn't get on the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it up as a gift?
You like living like this?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Don't you really have a home?
Do you play chess?
Her boyfriend is a Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are many breweries in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
Parents expected too much from their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He came into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move it!
You can sit on the chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all the students like English.
The test was so difficult that we didn't have time to finish it.
That's all I got.
You have to work fast.
If you believe that society has created nothing of value, you might as well believe in mass destruction.
English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were futile.
Where's the mirror?
This girl sings quite well.
Life is dishonest.
Each person paid a thousand dollars.
Jilly is the only girl in our club.
The students do not have to go to school today.
The sun disappeared behind the clouds.
His parents were pleased with his success.
This is our home now.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
He helped me fix my watch.
No one's ever hired you to help me.
John doesn't know what to do next.
He suffered from severe headaches.
I want a dog.
I have to find my pen.
Nigeria was once a British colony.
Don't throw stones into the river.
I speak German well.
She's painting her room white.
I can't leave until he comes.
I asked her to dance.
Have you done your homework?
John is a professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Did you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner he gets back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They tricked you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have hidden under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm an Irishman.
Here's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay his debt and disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like watching baseball and football.
Everyone but her smiled.
The queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Tom looks different today.
What's the rent on the room?
We gotta get out of here.
Tom doesn't ever want to do that again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long ago did you start learning Esperanto?
They're not a threat.
Her advice motivated me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places did the tour visit?
It started raining hard, so we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
You look lovely tonight.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, right?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed his clothes.
The oven is hot, so be careful not to burn yourself.
Did you find your letters?
For the love of God!
He doesn't remember if that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I'm tired of getting up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
That tree grows near her house.
Don't talk in the reading room.
How are you, miss?
I exchanged the yen for dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom is going to kill Mary.
There are only two right answers.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where did you put them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious. It's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This rug is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why isn't anyone eating my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She translated it literally.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She named him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's driving them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
Nobody believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I don't ever want to be in debt to anyone.
Look at the train going over the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored right now.
No, I don't think it was my fault.
Where are we?
I'm sixty-five years old.
Her hat looked funny.
Don't fuck her, she's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for the occasion.
It's similar.
Be careful, all right?
That's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I like that.
Tom will need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I see and hear.
Don't forget your ticket.
Raise your hand before you answer.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I was in bed all day yesterday.
The war interrupted their investigation.
When spring comes, the days get longer day after day.
I listened to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
This is Tony's book.
I should have come sooner.
Tom only eats what he wants to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He lost his ticket to the movies.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
What's your address, by the way?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African elephants are larger than Asian elephants.
What I always say.
He heard him crying in the middle of the night.
I'd like a glass of water, please.
He grabbed her hand.
Eat your bread!
If God did not exist, we would have to invent him.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very hospitable.
You're not getting it.
She has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Tom have experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian, you know.
You must go there.
What reason?
I can't see anything from here.
Since I didn't get a reply, I wrote her again.
She's standing outside the wall.
Don't expect too much from me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I had one beer and pretended to be very drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her go into the park.
You don't seem to be busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
He's short and fat.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was exhausting.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.
The dog is trying to break free.
Like I said, I'm not doing anything.
There's a little brown puppy behind that table.
Stop them.
Anna is a big chocolate lover.
I know Mike likes basketball.
I have to grind the whole bowl into an apple barrel.

Take the chair to your room.
The taxi suddenly turned left.
Yes, I see.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
He was charged with murder.
If you don't go to school, then you won't learn anything.
If anything happens, call me right away.

My friends are amazing.
Gold can't buy everything.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the throne?
She worked hard.
Don't be afraid of change.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what music she liked.
There are no witnesses.
Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She disappeared without papers.
I'm here a lot.
She continued her speech.
Mike doesn't know how to play baseball well.
Cranberries are often used for travel in the desert.
Mary is a bookworm.
Have a good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting time and get back to work.
The more the merrier.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
It is perfectly normal to want to be happy.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
My arm hurt yesterday.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father doesn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and said good night.
My friend is here.
Where do you live now?
The older you get, the harder it is to learn a language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that really true?
She's crying.
See you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took the family to the zoo.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
It's like half nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make him a photoboot!
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Tom will never disappoint you.
I was in Canada at the time.
I made this food myself.
Write with a pencil.
Someone wrote their name on the wall.
Anyone who can make a wrong turn will.
They're out of sugar.
I love your daughter.
Tom hopes he'll have some left over tonight and won't eat again.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He thought I was very tired.
I think she doesn't want to eat anymore.
You're either with us or against us.
Please help me!
Tom knows that Mary likes him.
I like this music.
She scared the dog.
He went to the laundromat, but he stopped at her house.
The snow falls quickly.
We're having lunch here.
Of course I should read this book.
Tom is not in prison at the moment.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship disappeared over the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work with you standing there.
Maril had a lung problem.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did she buy herself?
The child cried all night.
Can you see me?
She testified against him.
My father grows rice.
We speak Japanese.
The results were disappointing.
I climbed in through the window.
The meat is not ready yet.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Could you turn on the lights?
He doesn't trust the doctor anymore.
It was the first time I visited a museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom will want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You didn't have to eat that green fish.
Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Tom doesn't ever want to do that again.
I don't know.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to see your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm studying in Lisbon.
"Good morning", said Tom with a smile.
My arm hurts.
He needs a ladder.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in a week.
You have to make your own path in life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He was stunned and almost collapsed.
They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do that every Sunday morning.
She opened the letter quickly.
Are you busy right now?
I take back everything I said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I got in through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly wrote down our names.
Our son died in the war.
He's not happy with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him with that.
We may as well all go
Who is that person at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that's brilliant is simple.
Her students are studying too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Put your shoes on.
The birds have flown south.
This tea is very good.
I don't agree with him.
It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That's enough for now.
I'm not scared at all.
The woman wants to know the truth.
Is that a word you use often?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a linguist.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became a mail carrier.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took out a piece of chalk.
Let me do that.
I like jazz.
I am convinced that he is innocent.
Open the window and let in some fresh air.
Have you ever worn a saw?
It's snowing heavily.
Have you seen my mom?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like this.
Do you approve of what she's doing?
He came here before the end of class.
Do you know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat was lying on my pillow and wouldn't come down.
There are a few good hotels in town.
Who is this letter from?
He doesn't want to study today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I'm feeling a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She came?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, all right?
I bought a camera for thirty dollars.
This is great.
It's not a method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water's very shallow here.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell down the stairs.
He can interrogate people.
Bob was doing the dishes at the time.
My brother is two years older than I am, but he is three centimeters shorter than I am.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Tom will die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with the red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We are basketball players.
These clothes look good on you.
Don't blame her for that.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Tom couldn't find a reason why he had to come home early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw someone waiting for her outside the school.
You don't seem to be busy.
Where is Mary?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd call someone else later.
Oh, my God!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
That's a good one!
Tom, I'm back. I'm going to the bathroom.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
You can turn off the radio now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You're a very kind man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very sweet person.
I've been to Boston a few times.
You're a very nice person.
