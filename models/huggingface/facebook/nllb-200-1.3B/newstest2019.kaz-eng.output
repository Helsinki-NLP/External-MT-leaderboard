We know that the young people of today are connected to the smartphone.
The children and girls who have been listening to music on their mobile phones by earphones and wearing earphones on the outside, are not heard by anyone else, because the car is coming from outside and ignoring the signal.
There are youths that go astray from the paths of their ways, and fall into destruction.
And he that would not hearken unto the voice of the elders, he founded stone.
The stone-invented earpiece has a safety signal inside.
When the signal of cars, traffic workers, ambulance cars is activated, the music in the earphones stops immediately.

Teacher Askar Tokpanov: I saw you speaking on TV.
It's not bad.
And he said, "Go deeper, read the Abaya, and do not go away".
He read all of Abai's poems.
I also read many poems by Abhay and Mukhalie.
I read it over and over again.
The left-hand side will be in your memory.
When I was young, I was quick to sleep, and my memory was strong.
Today, that's all I have.
I'm a person who is easily absorbed and can talk.
I feel sorry for those who are "playing" his name and who are suffering.
That is a gift!
I will get 42 700 tenge this month.

The money you add will cover one of them.
Give it to me.

This elevator was a Soviet-era building that nobody needed in the '90s.
The company "Elevator Agrofood" has restored it as much as possible and now it is selling high-quality wheat with a density of 30 grams, although it is grown in the Torgai region.
We have a lot of interest in the wheat of the Turgai region, from China, from the Arabs, from Russia.
We will soon install a large German mill with a capacity of 70 tons of flour per day, and we will employ 10-15 people.
We are also hoping to increase the salaries.
Today, 22 people work in the elevator.
We have increased the salaries of 5-6 people who earn 32-33 thousand tenge per month.
It's just the basic salary.
The work in agriculture is not counted in time, sometimes additional work is required, and the hourly surcharge is paid, "says the executive director of the elevator, Kurman Abdrahman.
The limited liability company "Elevator Agrofood" is committed to further development of the quality storage and processing of durum wheat.
Now they are cleaning and sorting it to make it more attractive to Iran.
The task of the Head of State will be fulfilled without fail .
Why are we doing this if we are not developing the economy, if we are not benefiting the country?

A good businessman is a man of his word.
The fact that the Red Comrades of the Soviet Empire celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol in all cities and towns of Kazakhstan is a challenge to our country.
First of all, it means that the Komsomolists "turned" to the Independence of Kazakhstan.
The information that the followers of the red women, led by Nurlan Omarov, have celebrated the 100th anniversary of the red women with all their strength, led by former Komsomol leaders, has been published in the Internet.
I also saw on the Internet the red pioneers wearing red ties in schools in Kazakhstan, and I was impressed.
I was surprised to see that these Russian-Kula, that is, the native slaves, were openly harassing the young generation of Kazakhs, and I was speechless about these idiots... What a tragedy!
How can we understand that these Komsomolists are the slaves of Russia, who are denying the independence of the Kazakh country?
Oh, how sad, a slave is called a slave!
Ana Tasmagambetov, Aitymova, Sultanov - the fact that they admitted that they were in fact obedient slaves of the herders, openly expressing their "unlimited love for Russia" - we must first understand that today's followers of the Red Gendarmes of yesterday openly admit that they are still Russian farmers, who we say have not come.
In 1986 the current "eternal deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aytymova, in the famous December of 1986, one of them openly insulted and wept to Gennady Kolbin, who raised him in office, and now one of them said: "Comrade Kolbin, I will bring him to you by dragging the pigs by the hair and punishing them", who participated in the December of that same year, wrote a poem "Zobalan" about the same national tragedy during the Soviet Empire, in particular in 1990 as the author of a famous work that was radiopensed on a radio station of "Azat" in Munich and covered the world with the following questions: "The Red-haired, the Motherless, I still do not forget the sky!"
Even the Kazakh people, who were at peace in their hearts, did not forget!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, the firstborn of my Kazakh ethnicity, I openly condemn the followers of these red women!
If our state is truly independent, I will say openly that the day has come when the eternal president of this state will punish those who openly threaten the Independence of Kazakhstan as traitors of the state in front of the people or condemn the whole country!
"My country, my Kazakh, my people" (Abay), this was the moment when the red ginseng communists were publicly condemned all over the country.
Wake up, Kazakh, your sleep will never be forgotten.
Do not forget this, O death!

Because the air is so dirty, it's hard to breathe.
I remember the fresh air in my country, and I saw that there was a lot of work being done in Australia in this direction.

This year's festival will be chaired by Iraqi Kvirikadze, a well-known filmmaker, screenwriter and teacher.
The jury includes Silvan Kutandin ("Letter to Stein"), Russian actress Elvira Bolgová ("My Armenian Wedding", "Ogei Daughter"), Kyrgyz director Temirbek Birnazaraov and Kazakh writer Sabit Kurmanbekov.
Along with the main jury, the jury is composed of young cinematographers-students, as is the tradition in the "Bastauda" year.
This year's student jury includes students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia.
The Spanish director Яго Mateo Velasko, who won the "Bastava" two years ago, is now the chairman of the jury that evaluates the works of talented students.
There are many film festivals in the world, but "Bastaw" is a really successful festival, which gives you a good start.
The fact that the festival is international is a good thing for students, and we get a little insight into what the future of cinema will be.
Of course, there's the Oscars, there's the Cannes Film Festival, but you can't go there right away, so it's good to have a ladder like "The Beginning" that leads to the big contests.
The most important thing is literacy, a new worldview, we want to give young talented people access to the world of big festivals", says Mateo Velasko.
The festival was attended by the Dean of the Faculty of Film Production of Korea University of Media Arts Kim En-Doo, the sound director of Mosfilm Marina Nigmatullina and the cinematographer, the lecturer of the Karpenko-Karogo University of Ukraine Evgeny Filippov.
The jury and guests of the festival will have creative meetings and master classes with students of Almaty, specialists in cinema.
All the events of the festival, master classes will be held at the National Academy of Arts named after T. Jurgenov and the University of Turhan.
The international film festival is an important venue for young people.
The student should see from the very first job what competition is, not only what his peers are shooting, but also how their peers in other countries are looking for it.
It's not just about the film, it's about the interaction with the filmmakers, the exchange of ideas.
"Starting" is a crucial step in establishing creative communication.
Despite the complexities, the difficulty of stepping into the big cinematography, cinema has evolved.
Film festivals are essential for this purpose.
Cinema is a collective work, international cinema is universal, and we contribute to its development.
We are not just watching the film here, we are learning how to make it, says the president of the festival Sergey Azimov.
According to the organizers, the festival of student films, which was interrupted during the Soviet period, was continued during the independence period and is held for the 7th time this year.
Despite the challenges, the film festival has managed to attract the interest of the film community.

The Russian market is interested in Kazakh halal products .
They gave away the produce of the land and the produce of food and food.
The company "Zlak+ M" has been producing pasta since 1999.
Their products, which are popular in the regions of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, have now reached the Russian market.
We have a halal product, which is attracting the interest of consumers.
The exhibition was well organized, but we didn't see many competing pasta producers, but the exhibition space was always useful.
We met with a few companies who gave us good reviews.
People often came to us to ask us to sell our products.
There were many demands for all goods from Kazakhstan, said Petro Shaulsky, sales manager of the company.
Even before the exhibition started, the people of Chelyabinsk were waiting in line to buy Kazakh goods.
The Dairy Plant "DEP" in Kostanay has been known for many years in the Chelyabinsk market.
According to the representative of the factory Vadim Yamaletdinov, the firm had to take the product to the two-day exhibition several times.
The prices of local producers are high in the Chelyabinsk market, but the quality of our products is not inferior to theirs.
We sold milk at the farmer's price at the exhibition, which was certainly very popular with the buyers.
The first thing that the customers realized was that our product was natural, that it was real natural milk, not powdered milk.
Many people asked me, "How can I find your product in the region?"
"DEP is currently working hard to cover the entire market of the Chelyabinsk region, and then we will go to Ekaterinburg", said Vadim Yamaletdinov.
Don't be fooled by the hype.
And the mouth of the wicked shall be filled with deceitful men.
Now they are using the power of social media to make money in an easy way.
Recently, the police of Astana arrested a 23-year-old resident of the city of Taraz on suspicion of online fraud.
The tracker explained that the scammer had created an Instagram account and posted information about selling leather tones and leather goods.
To attract the attention of the people, he advertised the price of leather tones at a lower price than the market price.
The con artist noticed that the skin of the delicate creatures was changing in the cold, so she gave pictures of beautiful girls in different colors, even showing them to the addresses of the shops.
He was so unable to speak, he wrote to his "clients" on WhatsApp to avoid being recognized.
He promises to deliver the towels to the house, attracting the buyers.
And he asks to transfer 100% of the money in advance to Qiwi-wallet.
And that's it!
People who believed the words of a stranger transferred between 100 and 300 thousand tenge to the fraudster's accounts.
So, in a matter of days, he cheated 7 people in the capital and got 1.5 million tenge.
"It's over, it's gone", he says, counting the money, blocking the number, closing the accounts, and then he goes.
But the trickster's scheme failed.
The guards followed him and put sacks on his hand.
Currently , the suspect is being investigated under Article 190 of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan (prejudice).

Archimed Mukhambetov on the transformation of the Kostanay region into Torgai.

At the briefing held today in Astana , the question was asked about the open letter of the initiative group on the change of the name of the region .
I know the letter.
I saw it.
My position is generally against.
After all, Kostanay region has its own name, which comes from history.
I think it was signed by 17 people.
I know a few people.
When I spoke to them personally, a man named Sabirzhan Akhmetovich, who was the mayor of many districts, refused to sign this letter.
Kalibek Deripsaldin (composer) also said that he did not sign the letter.
I think it is not right to disturb the people here, "Archimed Mukhambetov said.
The governor of the region noted that there is a procedure for changing the name of the settlement, and that the hearings should be held.
So, we'll see.
But I'll tell you my general position.
We have a district center, which has been established under the name of Torgai.
If the name of the city of Kostanay in the thirties and forties was Torgai, then it is good to work on returning the former name.
And here my position is opposite", concluded Archimedes Muhambetov.

However, he suggested starting the city day with historical facts.
It is an old city on the Silk Road.
Shymkent, there is Taraz.
I have no objection to it.
If we say 2,200 years, let's call it that, let's start there.
But it has to be proved , " Nursultan Nazarbayev noted .
It should be noted that the President of Kazakhstan outlined the specific directions for the development of Shymkent .
The rules of the fight against "black archaeology" will be approved.
After the "black archaeologists", the monuments are left in the open and destroyed.
This was stated by Minister of Culture and Sports Aristanbek Mukhamediuly during the presentation of the draft law "On protection and use of historical and cultural heritage objects" in the Majilis.
The issue of regulating archaeological and restoration works on objects of historical and cultural heritage requires a review.
It is no secret that our unique monuments or unstudied objects are often subjected to search and excavation by "black archaeologists", after which the monuments are left in an open state and partially or completely destroyed.
In addition, the intensive construction works carried out in the adjacent areas of historical and cultural heritage objects have significant effects on the historical integrity and preservation of historical and cultural monuments and have negative consequences.
In general, there is a need to strengthen the legal sphere, which requires specific regulation and creation of favorable conditions for the protection and use of historical and cultural heritage objects , - the Minister noted.
According to him, in this regard, it is considered to establish the procedure for identification and accounting of objects of historical and cultural heritage at the legislative level, as well as monitoring their condition, to introduce new mechanisms for the preservation and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage in their final historical appearance.
In addition, it is proposed to establish rules and conditions for conducting archaeological works and combating "black archaeology", regulate the legal regime of land use in protected areas, construction of historical and cultural monuments, define the legal regime of use of natural landscape areas.
The draft law was drafted with the help of international experience.
For example, Russian legislation has introduced measures to combat illegal archaeological excavations, the confiscation of archaeological objects, the avoidance of the sale of artifacts to the state, and so on.
So, criminal responsibility is provided.
In Italy, there are obligations for private collectors at the legislative level.
According to them, it is planned to create and periodically update lists of cultural and art objects of historical and artistic interest and located in private property.
In addition , the objects in the property of the owners of these objects are subject to state protection , regardless of their nationality , - said A.Muhamedievich.

College leaders are deceiving the country and the government.
The prosecutor's office of East Kazakhstan region conducted an investigation into the activities of colleges in the region and identified numerous violations of the law, as well as the facts of misuse of budget funds.
In particular, during the placement of the state order, there were identified cases of non-compliance with the tender procedures, false teaching of students, illegal grant award, non-compliance of teachers with the qualification requirements, non-provision of students with dormitories, as well as income from illegal renting of state property.
It is often the case that the administration of educational institutions does not provide assistance in the employment of graduates by artificially increasing the number of graduates employed.
Despite the violation of the rules of placement of the state educational order, namely, the absence of accommodation for students from other places, the education department of the region annually granted grants to the business and service college of Semipalatinsk, the polytechnic college of Ayagoz and two colleges in Ust-Kamenogorsk.
The college administration included in the price of student accommodation in the hostel the costs for the public services included in the total amount of the contract, rented rooms in the hostels to third parties.
He has deceived 12 students at the college in Karsum.
Teachers and industrial teachers evaluated these students in theoretical and practical study journals during the course, sent them to interim certification, transferred them from course to course.
In addition, the total amount of damage caused to the state by the scholarships paid to these students amounted to 8 million tenge.
The investigation is ongoing.
The facts of illegal use of property for private purposes were also identified on the territory of the college .
For example, on the territory of East Kazakhstan regional art school named after the brothers Abdulinders, folk artists, there is a long-term paid parking.
After the proposal of the prosecutor, the parking lot is planned to be closed and a sports field will be built in its place.
According to the results of the investigation , prosecutors determined damage amounting to more than 43 million tenge .
So far , 36 million tenge have been collected according to the control acts .
60 persons were brought to disciplinary responsibility and 4 persons to administrative responsibility.
