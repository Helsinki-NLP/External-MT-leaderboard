Thousands panicked in Central Park after the barrier broke down
Thousands of people were thrown into trouble by the fear of possible gun shots as they marched through Central Park due to the breaking of a police barrier at a political event.
Democratic New York government big names Andrew Cuomo and Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and John Legend of Janet Jackson urged the audience to get involved in the nation's troubled politics.
After the barrier fell on Saturday evening, officials assured the crowd that they were safe.
Burning issues of social justice dominated the early afternoon event.
The Great Lawn of the park was packed with about 60,000 people for the Global Citizen Festival, which also featured Cardi B, The Weekend and other pop stars.
Some speakers asked the audience to summon their congressmen to comment on this week's Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Anna Hazare to go on hunger strike from 2nd October, PM writes PM Modi
Maharashtra: Social activist Anna Hazare has announced a hunger strike from October 2.
Anna Hazare, striking the Prime Minister, said that the BJP-led government has come to power in the centre due to the Lokpal movement.
But four years have passed and the government is avoiding the appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta for some reason.
He said that he will start a hunger strike on the Lokpal nominee from 2nd October and he is firm on his decision.
Anna Hazare has written to the Prime Minister Modi on Thursday accusing the government of making excuses and not appointing the Lokpal in four years.
Anna wrote that the country went all the way up on 16th August 2011 to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta.
Your government has come to power because of this movement.
Anna had earlier announced that she will unseat in Rallegan Siddiqui from 2nd October on the occasion of Gandhi's birth anniversary.

Pakistan threatens after Sushma's screaming at the UN, says India must not make the mistake of attacking
New Delhi: Pakistan has been rocked by the outcry over the statement by Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj in the UN General Assembly.
Pakistan has been poisoned by lies.
And the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was raised.
Pakistan said India would suffer the consequences if it did not make the mistake of attacking.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmud Qureshi said the Kashmir issue has been a stain on humanity for 70 years and the unresolved conflict is having an impact on lasting peace between India and Pakistan.
India should not test our patience, India should suffer the consequences if it makes a mistake of attacking.
We will not accept Pakistan's sovereignty.
On cancelling the Foreign Minister-level speech, Qureshi said that Pakistan wanted to talk to India on all issues but India cancelled the speech because it gave priority to domestic politics.
Pakistan has not forgotten to raise its anger over Kashmir again from the UN forum.
"We want to resolve disputes through serious and comprehensive discussion", Kurashi said in his speech.
This includes all the issues of concern.
It is worth mentioning that Sushma Swaraj had made a statement on Pakistan at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Saturday.
Not only that, he also mentioned the mastermind of 9/11 Osama bin Laden and the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks Hafiz Saeed in his address to the UN.
Sushma Swaraj said that Pakistan is a neighboring country that has mastered not only the spread of terrorism but also the denial of its actions.
He said that the 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden who attacked America was found here.
He was killed but the 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed is still walking open in Pakistan.
He is rallying, running elections and threatening India.
Sushma said that terrorists in Pakistan are considered freedom fighters, if Pakistan's actions are not stopped, the whole world will be burned at the stake by terrorism.

Supreme Court decision not to refer the issue of prayer in mosques to the Constitutional bench
Justice Ashok Bhushan said in his ruling that every ruling is in a different situation.
It is important to understand the context of the previous judgment.
Justice Bhushan said that the last judgment said that performing prayers in a mosque is not an integral part of Islam, but there is something else connected with it.
Justice Bhushan said on behalf of himself and Chief Justice Deepak Mishra that the matter does not need to be referred to the Grand Bench.
We need to understand that the 1994 ruling was based on land acquisition.

When will you open the doors of the temple to a woman who is in her period?
My newly married sister told me about two weeks ago that she was preparing for fasting before her third.
The third is a festival celebrated mainly in North India, which is celebrated with prayers for happy marriage.
For the third, married women fast all day and worship at every stroke of the night.
I was so excited and happy when I heard her voice.
Saki took a new sock to wear on the third day and also put a mahendi on both hands.
I was happy to see him, but his periods started at three in the morning.
Then both his mother and his mother-in-law forbade him to fast or worship.
Other women in the house also advised me to stay away from the prayer room and mistakenly told me not to touch the worship items.
I was also told to stay away from other women who were fasting for the third time.
The period and the entrance to the temple
After that, when Saki spoke to me almost crying for the second time, I felt like someone had put a lump in my throat.
I thought about my sister's enthusiasm and her preparation for the third.
I looked at the photograph of Mahdi's hand on WhatsApp again and my eyes suddenly became wet.
And I said to him in my anger, Thou hast also forsaken the third religion, which decides thee to enter the temple for the period, rather than for the love and for the love of thy heart.
I was reminded of my happy and third case in Bhopal when news of the Supreme Court order lifting the ban on women entering Sabarimala temple was flashing on a number of TV screens on Friday morning.
What was the Sabarimala Temple Dispute?
Kerala's Sabarimala temple has so far banned entry of women aged 10 to 50.
The ban had been in place for hundreds of years at this temple, which is considered one of the main Hindu pilgrimage sites.
The reasoning behind this discrimination was that Lord Ayyappa was a lifelong Brahmin who sat inside the temple.
Therefore, women of menstrual age cannot go there to worship.
The Indian Young Lawyers Association challenged the ban in 2006 by filing a public interest petition in the Supreme Court.
After 12 years of hearing and hours of hearing of the arguments of both parties, the Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India, composed of five members, delivered its verdict on 28 September 2018.
What did the Supreme Court say?
Chief Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice R.
Nariman, Justice A.M.
The Constituent Assembly of Khanvilkar and Justice Chandrashud ruled that the ban on women entering the temple violated Article 14 of the Constitution.
The bench said, "Everyone should be allowed to worship in the temple without discrimination".
The fifth and only female judge in the Constituent Assembly, Justice Indu Malhotra, disagreed with the decision of the remaining four judges and the court ruled 4-1.
The unreasonable dust of superstition
As I read about the court ruling, I saw my niece's face in my mind.
My teenage niece has started periods two years ago.
He told me one day in a panicked voice that his grandmother had refused to go to Lordji's room when he was in his period.
It also banned entering the kitchen and touching the strawberries.
My nephew told me, "That day my mother made me a future doll.
I was so hungry that I couldn't remember my periods were going on.
So I ran to the kitchen to pick up the cut from the stove.
"Afterwards Grandma came up and she was very angry with Mom", he said, asking me why.
I had no answer to his question.
Like my distant niece, the girls who are growing up in hundreds of households in India are asking us for answers.
The question is, if the Supreme Court lifted the ban on women entering Sabarimala, when will we remove the unreasonable dust of superstition in our minds?
When will we open our homes, our kitchens and the doors of our hearts to women going through periods?
Periods or menstruation is a common biological process associated with reproduction in the body of women.
How could the process that caused creation and human existence be impure?
And if a woman be unclean on the fifth day of her month, then shall we cut off the measure of her holiness.
The Supreme Court may stand up to us in a world-wide voice, but the question is when will we stand up to the other half of our population as a society?
A tribal Sardar from Kerala who never left the flood forest
Recently, flooding in Kerala has completely destroyed the Chhola Naikr community that lived in the mountainous area.
Most of the population of this community has left the forest and plans have been made for their alternative habitat.
However, the community chief is not willing to leave the forest, as he fears the clash.
What is this fear, see this video report.

Donut seller Lena Ognissanti to be honored by the Bedford Mayor
Image caption Lena Ognissanti sells ice cream in the hot months and doughnuts in the winter
A woman selling donuts and ice cream in the town centre for more than 40 years will be honoured with a private mayoral reception.
Lena Ognissanti, who runs a dinky donuts and ice cream stall on Midland Road in Bedford, has been invited for lunch tea with her family.
About 3,000 people signed an online application to get him an award or honour.
Ms. Ogunisenti said it was an "honor" to think of her so highly.
Bedford Mayor Dave Hodgson said that Mrs. Ognissenti was invited to visit civil icons and historical artifacts in her parlor with her children and grandchildren and for lunch tea.
"Lina has a special status in Bedford, and her stand is a tradition in the heart of the city", he said.
"I am glad that Lena accepted my invitation and I look forward to welcoming her to the parlor so that we can show appreciation for her contribution to the city".
Ms. Ognissenti thanked the "white" people of Bedford for thinking for themselves and said: "It's a great honour for me and feels really good".
Sarkab Mahmud, who initiated the petition, said he did not expect such a massive response.
Hearing about the reception, which is due to take place at the end of the year, he said: "I'm really happy for it, it's all for Lena's greatness".
A return with the Ulster Lambretta Club
Lambrettes were an essential support in the 1960s fashion scene.
The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of Italian motor scooter enthusiasts.
About 100 scooters from across the UK and Ireland travelled to Co Fermanagh this weekend, 70 years after the first Ulster Lambretta Club was formed.
One of the two original members of the club, Chris Wilson bought his first lambretta in 1966 for £40.
"The scooter was not only a form of transportation for me, but also an option to use it for other things.
It was like a little sport.
I was never in the fashion scene and now I am too old for doing a lot of it", he said.
"It was basically relatively cheap, relatively reliable and it was available at a reasonable price and once you had it you could do other things than just ride A to B space".
He raced a Lambretta in a time trial around the TT circuit on the Isle of Man.
The first Ulster Lambretta Club was incorporated in the early 1970s but was renovated 12 years ago.
"It started to die around 1971, in scooters, interest and difficulties in other forms of transportation didn't usually help the club, so I thought, 'No, just, finished,'" Chris said.
"And then a while ago there was a lot of interest in it and it seems to be growing more and more".
Philip Steel is the Membership Secretary of the Ulster Lambretta Club which currently has 97 members.
"Each has shown his own contribution.
Obviously, it will have people who are influenced by the full mode scene, and that's where a lot really started.
Others are in racing scenes, rockers, here's a mix of all sorts of people.
Some people are just in the vintage thing.
Many scooters were customized and none of them two scooters are the same.
You can either keep it rooted or keep it running at 35 or 40 MPH, which was originally designed to go on the small streets of Italy, but some people have tuned this.
Some of the highly tuned bikes here can probably go above 100 mph".
At the end of the week there were a few breakdowns and shocks to start with.
And while the weather in Northern Ireland was not always as pleasant as the Italian home of Lambretta, the sun was shining as the scooters traveled around County Fermanagh.
Ruth Davidson orders a Tory Brexit for 'silence'
Ruth Davidson has ordered a "silent period" among her conservative colleagues so that the prime minister can get a Brexit deal "above the limit".
The Scottish Tory leader said there was enough time for discussion in the two years following the European Union referendum.
Her comments follow Boris Johnson's description of the Chechers scheme as "narrow and completely reckless".
She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland that it was time to go after the Prime Minister.
As Tory activists gathered in Birmingham for their party convention, she said: "It's been two years since the time for discussion.
The former Foreign Secretary was in one of the great offices of the state when much of the plan was being planned - and praised it as early as November last year.
Now is the time to go after the Prime Minister, give him the flexibility to complete the deal and support him to serve the country.
In terms of the silent period, I will be extolling my welcome to him".
Her comments came after another violent intervention in the Brexit debate by former Secretary of State, Boris Johnson.
Theresa May later told the BBC's Andrew Murray programme that the Chechers scheme had the potential to provide a realistic free trade deal with the European Union, thus stressing that she believed in Brexit.
Ms Davidson also said she would run for election next year with a declaratory commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum as she "promised the people of Scotland in 2014 that this would be a one-off event for a generation".
Asked about the order for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: "In the context of our history in Scotland, I have been repeatedly speaking about the fact that if you are a nationalist you cannot run a referendum again because you have not achieved the desired result.
I would be a hypocrite if I had said that you could run this Brexit referendum again because the results I argued for did not come".
The M8 completely reopened after the police incident.
The M8 motorway in Glasgow has been completely reopened after being closed by a police incident.
The road was closed in both directions at Junction 15 Townhead amid concerns for pedestrian welfare, police said.
The closure resulted in the road being completely frozen for three hours and caused traffic jams in the city, with the Great Scottish Run scheduled.
The 20-year-old was then taken to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary for examination.
Christine Blaisey clarifies a statement about the alleged attack by Ford's friend Brett Cavanow
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's high school friend Leland Keiser, who accused her of sexually assaulting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter clarifying to the Senate Judiciary Committee, though she does not remember the House party where the alleged misconduct was committed, but she holds Ford responsible.
Keiser had previously released a statement by her attorney saying she did not remember the party in question, and she does not even remember ever meeting Cavenaw.
In her testimony before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Cavendish repeatedly presented Keiser's statement as evidence of her innocence, though she went so far as to say that Keiser said she trusted Ford.
After Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and other moderate senators demanded a week-long delay on the full Senate vote on Kevanou's confirmation to give time for the investigation, President Trump suggested the FBI conduct an investigation within a week on Friday.
On Saturday, Keiser told the committee in a letter through his lawyer that he was ready to "fully cooperate with the FBI's further investigation" of Cavanow.
"However, as my client has already clarified, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and she can't remember anything about ever having been to a party or where she was present with or without Dr. Ford", Keiser's attorney Howard Walsh wrote in a letter.
It also stated that Keiser "does not deny Dr. Ford's responsibility, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford is responsible".
"However, the simple and irrefutable truth is that she is unable to confirm the claim because she has no memory of the incident", the letter further states.
A friend of Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, who was allegedly present during the attack, also said he would cooperate with the FBI investigation.
Falsely convicted Chicagoans remember their lives under corrupt police and their "gangs".
Illinois' top attorney is trying to turn the pages of a desperate period in the history of the Chicago Police.
It is believed that an evil police officer attacked innocent residents of a housing project, which killed dozens of people on trumped-up charges.
So far, 42 wrongfully convicted people have been acquitted.
The Ida B. Wells Housing Project, where a group of corrupt Chicago cops attacked residents almost fearlessly for most of a decade, now has only one empty lot left.
Sergeant Ronald Watts was his commander.
Residents have accused him and his strategic squad of misappropriation by filing false police reports, fabricating evidence and assault.
Cookie County State Attorney Kim Fox is the only two of Willie Martin and Clawne Glover to have been acquitted so far.
"If you hadn't cooperated with him, you were going down.
You were against it.
You were against her way of managing and getting money", Clone Glover told Watson.
"I was frightened.
I was trying to get away, he got out of the way.
I didn't have anywhere to go", said Willie Martin.
Lawyers at Fox's Innocence Integrity Unit are reviewing 30 to 40 additional cases related to votes.
Lyndon Allen, a resident of Ida B. Wells Housing, said that a lot of people talk about votes.
"Everyone has spoken", he said.
"But it doesn't matter".
As directed by another former resident, Clarissa Baker, it was her word to a sergeant wearing a badge.
"He has his own gang.
Who, then, will trust us?
Baker said.
Joshua Taffer of the University of Chicago's Guilt-Free Project recently said there was no one to answer until.
"They put it forward because they saw these people as disposable and didn't care because they were black people in the housing project, guilty of the grass in any way they felt", Taffer said.
"Sgt. Watts went to jail in 2013 and spent 22 months in prison for attempting to steal from the FBI news.
Because of Watts - Martinez Wise also went to jail.
I had only my son at that time.
I was away from him for four years.
He barely knew who I was because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him", Wise said.
"Four years without any crime".
72-year-old fidelity betting on the future with blockchain, virtual reality and AI
He recognized the potential of blockchain before Fidelity became the corporate buzzword of 2018.
CEO AB Johnson pushed the Hawala to cryptocurrency, which was one of the most risky and volatile asset classes of the past year.
"A few more years ago, I and some other senior officials were just curious to know what was going on here, especially for Bitcoin", Johnson said.
We started together so we could say 'we've started to understand this.'
This curiosity led him to "mine" Bitcoin at a site in New Hampshire, when the crypto was worth about $180.
When Bitcoin rose to almost $20,000 last December, Johnson said, "Look - the price has gone up and suddenly we're making money we never expected".
She did not mention how many bitcoins were mined or how much Fidelity earned.
Fidelity employees are clearly interested in the subject.
The blockchain, known as "Bits and Blocks" for its employees, hosts clubs, seminars, office hours, and meet-ups, which now has about 2,600 members.
The company has an arrangement with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to verify their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, he started to facilitate charitable donations in Bitcoin.
Johnson said that many other potential uses for bitcoin and cryptocurrency have so far been scrapped or "put off by the authorities".
We are trying to listen to the market.
Meanwhile, Katie Chase, Head of Strategy for the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and Head of the Blockchain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), is exploring uses for both public blockchain and enterprise blockchain.
Chase could not comment on projects in particular but said she saw a large amount of interest from customers and partners as well as their own employees.
"It's still very new.
Everything you're reading, if you dig deeper into it, is still in the proof-of-concept stage", Chase said.
We have tried to apply blockchain to some examples where we learned a lot but the technology is not mature enough to solve these problems".
Enough is enough, the group is focusing more on some obstacles, she said.
They're looking at how to "tokenize" physical things, for example a piece of art, or how to use a blockchain in a supply chain space.
"He's on the run, but we think he'll eventually come back", Chase said.
"Fidelity will be well equipped when it starts".
She used an example of a Pebble watch that was a failure by retail standards, but something that paid for fidelity.
Her team created an app for SmartWatch, which ended up raising millions of dollars through a crowdfunded Kickstarter campaign.
Fidelity was ready when the Apple Watch finally hit the market.
She used an app developed for Pebble to quickly come live on Apple's new product.
"We don't bet that a Pebble Watch is the next big thing - but if we have people wearing these on our wrists, we should be there too", she said.
"It taught us when smartwatches hit the mass market, and we were able to stay there".
The earthquake, tsunami, and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, September 29, a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, causing a tsunami and killing 400 people.
Hundreds were also injured, and the death toll was expected to rise.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency said that electricity and communications have been cut, making it difficult to assess the city of Palau and the nearby fishing community of Donggala.
California high school students tie on a T-shirt with ethnic slurs
This week, the Eskandido Union High School District confirmed that at a senior event, about 10 students participated in a sexual assault stunt and made a "strong decision", CNN affiliate KGTV reported.
Adriana Leap-Ramirez, Principal, said in a statement, "We are a campus that prides itself on convention and welcomes diversity".
"We will not tolerate any actions that send messages of racism and promote division".
The statement said that Eskandido High School, district officials and local police are investigating the incident, the station reported.
"Parents and guardians involved are being contacted by the school administrators and steps will be taken for appropriate discipline", the statement said.
During the senior picnic, schoolchildren in northern San Diego wear lettered shirts and take photographs by standing next to each other, the station said.
These terms are usually approved ahead of time but some students attach their own words after an official photo is taken.
The district statement stated that the activity "is not consistent with the culture, values or history of Escondido High School".
"We all need to understand the power of our words and actions, and we need to take responsibility for the decisions we make every day", said Lip-Ramirez.
"At Eskindo High School, we will continue to work every day to create a culture of family and unity in our community".
An ex-student, Cad Panell, who saw an aggressive photo on social media told KGTV that the image angered him.
"It hurt me personally", he said.
"Maybe he thought it was a joke, it's not a joke.
And if you think it's a joke, I think you're very ignorant".
Shaquille O'Neal's son Sharif will have heart surgery, miss his first season at UCLA
Basketball Hall of Fame Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal's son, Sharif O'Neal, will miss his new season at UCLA due to heart problems.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neill will undergo surgery to correct a reported problem while UCLA doctors were doing regular checkups.
"Thank God the UCLA medical staff caught him so early", O'Neill told TMZ.
"During the rehabilitation, I will attend my classes as a normal student.
I will be back soon".
O'Neill officially signed a letter of intent to play at UCLA in August, adding another Marquess to the name of one of the nation's best freshman classes for the 2018-19 season.
"The sheriff has made a lot of progress over the course of his high school career", Bruins head coach Steve Alford told reporters last month.
"He's an excellent addition to our upcoming class and an excellent combination of size, skill and athleticism.
We are very much looking forward to the length and height of this year's team, and Sharif will really add to that dynamic.
It has a tremendous frame, which will continue to improve its performance on both sides of the floor".
According to 247Sports, 18-year-old O'Neal, is a 4-time candidate who is ranked as the No. 8 power forward and No. 41 overall player in the 2018 recruiting class.
Prior to committing to UCLA, O'Neill led Crossroads High School to a 25-9 record during his senior season.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is accused of killing his father.
28-year-old was arrested on three charges including the attack on Track Palin
Sunday's incident involving domestic violence is not his first arrest.
According to court records, the incident occurred at Palin's home in Wasilla, Alaska, where Trac Palin bled his father, Todd, in a truck dispute.
Isam, 28, was arrested on three charges including assault following the incident on Saturday.
According to court documents, when the dispute began he was called to say that he wanted to get the truck and his father refused.
Track Palin was arrested on charges of first-degree theft, fourth-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal activity, and his father suffered injuries to his face and head, court filings show.
Documents say, Track Palin called the officers at the scene of the "farmers" and asked them to drop their weapons while trying to communicate with him.
According to court filing, at one point, he went to the garage roof before finally hanging up.
According to court documents, Sarah Palin said her son was "scared" and was "on certain kinds of drugs".
Documents indicate that Track Palin also told police that he had drunk a few beers earlier.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence assault against a woman, interference in a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon in intoxication.
"My own son is going through what, he's going back to what, I can relate to other families experiencing the after effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers come back with", said the former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor at the time.
"And it makes me more aware than ever that for America's best, there is now, if not ever, a situation where we have a commander-in-chief who will respect and honor them".
Elizabeth Warren says she will think about the presidency after midterm
A Democratic senator told a town hall crowd in Holyoke, Massachusetts, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top".
"So here I promise: After November 6, I will be focusing on running for president".
Warren, who is fighting to defend his seat this year against the challenge of Republican state Rep. Jeff Dahl, had previously lowered the expectation of a race by saying he was focused on his work in the Senate.
"It is really important that we focus on the midterm elections and the only important bright spot in the room is 2020", she told reporters during a speech at the National Press Club in August.
"What's going on right now is the midterm election, and that's true in Massachusetts, that's true across the country".
Warren has long been considered a potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee to replace President Donald Trump.
However, she will face a highly competitive primary race, as several other high-profile Democrats are running for the top office, including former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris, and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
A third mysterious death in less than a year is associated with a celebrity mental health clinic.
A third suicide is believed to have occurred in less than a year at a private psychiatric hospital, The Mail on Sunday may release.
The daughter of a TV comedian, Shaquille Vidal, died on 7 April, after spending about a month as a "volunteer" patient at Nightingale Hospital in Marylebone, West London.
She was the girlfriend of a 57-year-old James Lyle, a millionaire hedge fund boss and former Conservative Party donor, whose cost of care reached a five-figure sum.
The death of the apprentice chef, the granddaughter of Rose Grey, co-founder of River Café, came about exactly six months after the death of socialite and artist, 28-year-old Daisy Boyd.
Miss Boyd was struggling with her separation with 43-year-old published heir Dan Macmillan, who died on October 5 under the influence of cocaine smuggling by a visitor.
Two months earlier, film set designer, 61-year-old Alan McDonald, had cut short his life four days after being discharged from the hospital.
In May, the Care Quality Commission criticized Nightingale for making little effort to combat "illegal substances" brought to the site.
Shaquille, daughter of BBC's Mock the Week panelist Eva Vidal, was admitted to hospital on 11 March.
Katie Golope QC said at a pre-trial hearing at the Westminster Coroner's Court last week that she went on "unauthorised leave" on 29 March and that her mental state deteriorated when she returned a week later.
"Miss. Golope, who plays for Eva Vidal, said: "My client would like to know what's going on with Shaquille... to understand who she's in contact with and what she's doing".
She referred to Mr. Lyle as Shackel's "boyfriend".
John Gordillo, a 52-year-old comedy director, who was described as Shaquille's "unofficial stepfather", said: "I know Shaquille is still in contact with James Lyle and was in New York at the time".
Mr. Gordillo told the hearing that on April 4, Shekel called him and told him he had to buy and take cyanide after he called the hospital "more than a dozen times" in 20 minutes but no one answered.
"I think someone who was picked up during that period, who was chased, could have been avoided", he added.
On April 5, a hospital doctor assessed Shackel as "deeply mentally ill".
Less than 48 hours later, she hung herself using a laptop cable.
A Nightingale spokesperson expressed sympathy for her family and friends, saying: "Our hospital is committed to providing high quality care in a safe and curative environment".

Led Zeppelin faces new trials over claims they stole a guitar riff for the song Stairway to Heaven
Led Zeppelin were facing new trials over claims that they stole a guitar riff from their 1971 classic hit song Stairway to Heaven.
A British band is accused of a fictionalized portion of their 1971 hit song
The Appeals Court rejected a 2016 ruling that the group did not copy the band named Spirit.
The trustee for the Spirit guitarist's songs, Michael Skidmore, sued Fair in 2015
The song goes a little bit longer - and it seems that the fictionalized case of Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven will become another longplayer.
The band is facing a new trial over claims they stole a guitar riff for the 1971 folk song.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has dismissed a 2016 ruling that the group did not copy their early hits from the Spirit Band's music.
It was said that the trial judge made mistakes including misled jurors about copyright laws.
The case was sent back to the court.
The trustee for the lyrics to Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe, Michael Skidmore, originally filed a lawsuit in 2015.
Michigan police finish the police race as officers are shot at by a murder suspect.
The pursuit of the police ahead of the suspect in killing his Michigan girlfriend ended when he was run over by a police car.
Adam Nolin, 33, is suspected of shooting and killing his 27-year-old girlfriend Tia Mae Randall in Wyoming, Michigan, on Thursday.
He was found guilty at a hospital on Friday where he shot officers with a police SUV while trying to escape on a busy highway.
Nolin is charged with five felony counts including assault with intent to kill and flight from police.
"Inquiring in a hospital is definitely not the rule, but it's not what I've heard", said James Magfi, a Wyoming police captain.
'He is getting the necessary treatment, but we also need to turn the wheels of justice.
Judges will provide facilities to do so from time to time.'
Nolan's girlfriend's body was found Thursday morning at a Creekside Estates mobile home.
The mother of two was shot and killed in a single shot and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
Police then issued a public alert for the search for Nolin, and gave a detailed physical description of him and his 1996 Black Dog pickup truck.
He was seen in his truck and as the police tried to pull him out, Nolly jumped onto US 131.
Nolin broke his truck down on a concrete medium and then got out and started running on foot on the highway.
While he was running, Nolly shot at officers pursuing him.
Taking a cop police SUV and running back to Nolyn.
The incident was videotaped by an overhead viewer.
He was taken to hospital where he was in a serious but stable condition and will remain there until he is released and transferred to Kent County Jail.
"It shows the willingness of our police officers in Western Michigan to endure the loss of their lives to protect this community", said Magfi.
'They took possession of the Ism in due time and in due course and we are proud of them.'
In short, Nolin is charged with two counts of assault with intent to kill, running from the police, carrying a concealed weapon and using a firearm.
As the murder investigation continues, he will still be charged with the death of his girlfriend.
"The investigation into the underlying homicide is definitely ongoing and we are close to wrapping it up and we will present it to the Kent County prosecutor in due course", Magfi said.
The judge built a bridge to the praise of the brave landlord who broke the tooth of a frog during a burglary in his home.
The judge praised one householder and gave him "full marks" of bravery who faced two scams while attempting to rob his home.
Despite a criminal raising a wooden stick over him, 63-year-old David Oldham was not silent.
Instead, the university's estate manager fought Sam, slapping both offenders and killing one.
The criminals escaped, but blood trails were left on Mr. Oldham, one of them, Craig Ford, was identified and arrested four months later.
Punishing Ford, who lost a tooth whistling outside his separate £400,000 home in Ormskirk, Lancashire, at the time, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, said: "Mr. Oldham gave you more than you needed because when he ran out of his house with you, your mouth was hidden and only your eyes and nose were visible so he beat you.
And not only did he strike you with his spear, but when your fellow servant who was on the stairs fell down from the roof, he struck him.
After Ford served three years and four months in prison, the judge said Friday: "I hope you have learned two lessons.
One, you won't crowd with David Oldham, and two, you won't crowd with the police either.
For these transgressions thou hast done, and now thy tooth is cut down, and thou art pierced by the dogs.
At least that's what you deserve".
He added: "I am a complete marksman for responding to Mr. Oldham's actions".
Government attorney, Derek Jones, said that at the time of the theft, Ford was licensed from a three-year sentence imposed in 2016, including theft.
Liverpool Crown Court heard that Mr Oldham had done so by hearing voices outside his home at 7am on 5 April.
Mr. Jones said: "Mr. Oldham, the sporting man bravely went to the side of the building and faced the defendant coming in front of him.
Fearing for his safety, he once struck her face with a punch that pushed her to the floor and knocked out the tooth.
Then another intruder came down from the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who bluntly slapped him in the face".
Mr. Jones said that the companion took a wooden stick and raised it in front of Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: "Shit him, he broke my teeth".
A companion told Mr. Oldham: "If you let us go, we will leave him now", and he and Ford ran away.
On August 2, police arrested Ford after he ran a print on a house in Waverty.
Ford kicked a police dog who then hit him on the shoulder.
The second thief is still believed to be on a large scale.
Ford, 25, has no fixed address, was convicted of theft, fraudulent assault and illegal driving and driving without a license.
Blows for Boris as Tory workers attack him in a conference hall
Boris Johnson had to suffer a blow as Tory activists attacked him as 'inconsistent and aggressive'.
Despite Mr Johnson's tough approach to Brexit, a brutal assessment by former Trade Minister Digby Jones worked well with members at a conference in Birmingham this afternoon.
Meanwhile, David Davis struck that Mr. Johnson was focusing on 'headlines' rather than rigid policies.
And Mrs. Mana's Cabinet Mate told MailOnline that she was making so much 'rumor' because she didn't have 'numbers' for an all-out leadership bid.
This negative reaction came after the former Foreign Secretary launched another evil attack on the PM's Checker Plan by branding Brexit - 'terrible' and 'useless'.
Mr. Joneson raised the issue by pointing out that she was a remanner during the referendum two years ago - when she was a true believer in the project.
He also urged the Government to support ambitious projects such as building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
But a rebel Ms May has responded that her critics were 'playing politics' and she is not 'openly threatening' to run a tough deal with the EU.
Speaking during an interview on the BBC's Andrew Mar Show to kick off the Tory Conference, Ms May said: 'I believe in Brexit.'
Lord Jones, a former Labour Trade Minister, who is now an independent, pleases people by praising Brexit's opportunities.
But he praised Mr. Johnson's alleged comment, when he called 'business indecent' in response to questions about the issues raised.
Without naming Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones targeted him as 'a truly inconsistent and offensive person'.
'Business is so important that when I heard the former foreign secretary say 'business is a bad word', he described him as a really inconsistent and offensive person,' he said.
'I would make a big exception for that.'
Lord Jones also welcomed the response of Mrs May who - at the Salzburg Summit - saw from the hall a speech of 'threatening' by EU leaders over her checker scheme.
Earlier, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also targeted Mr Johnson, and indicated that he had already remained a senior member of the government during the Brexit negotiations.
The Cabinet Mate of Mrs. Mana, interjected by telling MailOnline that Mr. Johnson did not have sufficient support to remove the Prime Minister.
He said: "It is not harmful to have such stories in today's papers.
He's making a lot of noise, but Boris doesn't have a number in the parliamentary party, and he knows that's the point.
There is a great contradiction between the respectable statements of David Davis, the arguments in his case, and the way Boris has pursued his personal ambitions.
Business Secretary Greg Clark had beaten Mr Johnson for attacking business for being suspicious of Brexit.
Speaking on matters of the Birmingham Tory Conference, Mr. Clark said that Mr. Johnson's disobedience was "quite wrong".
He said: "I was surprised that anyone could think that.
There is no successful economy anywhere in the world that does not have a successful and prosperous business.
In an interview with Sky News' Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis admitted that the next few months will be 'really terrible' as the EU attempts to force a major relaxation from the UK.
But he said the Government should maintain its patience to emphasize the Canada-style agreement over the checks.
Asked about Mr. Johnson's attractions as a Tory leader, he also cited a curious figure.
Mocking Mr Johnson's proposal to bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said that 'one of the losses to British politics is strong thinking.'
He added: 'We have a special friendship, but most of his thoughts are not good headlines or good policies.'
Bulgaria spends £80 million of European taxpayers to bring back the money with the scandal
Bulgaria costs European taxpayers £80 million to make ancient castles look like 'cheese and cardboard' to bring in a bucket of cash.
The Balkan nation has spent £80 million of the EU's Regional Development Fund.
Rather than returning to its former glory, the construction work has made a joke.
The local government has pledged to strengthen the light work near Krakra Fort.
The Bulgarian government has spent millions of European money on the restoration of medieval castles.
The Balkan nation has spent 80 million pounds of EU regional development funds to renovate ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of restoring them to their former glory, the construction work has left them a mocking object.
The costly reconstruction work has left the remains as 'cheese and cardboard' and has led to tourists being driven away from the site.
The medieval Roman fortress of the Traynovy Vratna near Krakra and Ihteman in Pernik, western Bulgaria, sparked the wrath of conservationists after others rebuilt it between polymer concrete, often used to build footpaths.
According to a report, the Telegraph reported that both the EU and the government have privately agreed that lessons should be learned after this launch.
'It is a tear-jerking fortress,' said a conservative architect Stella Dulaeva about the Traynowie Vrata.
'It has survived for 16 centuries, and now it is ruined.'
This was the negative reaction to the restoration of Krakra Castle in Pernik that local authorities said they would scatter the additions in 2019.
Pernick Fort is called 'cardboard fort' because of the intermediaries who built it.
The Byzantine fortress of Yalta, known as the 'Cheese Castle' because it was rebuilt with white Lisa blocks, collided with its weather-damaged façade.
The curious thing is that the European Union faces a recent review of how its development funds are being used.
Thousands of stylish bikers take to the road for this year's Distinguished Gentleman Ride.
Hundreds of hardcore bikers took to the streets of the UK in stylish suits and vintage motorbikes to raise money for the Movember Foundation.
The event is known as the Distinguished Gentleman Ride and is held annually to raise money and awareness for men's mental health and prostate cancer.
This year's event saw bikers in London and participants from 40 other locations across the UK including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.

According to the event's official website, more than 120,000 people at today's event wore their crowns, tied their ties, wore their tweets, and sat tattoos on their classic and vintage motorcycles aimed at raising funds and raising awareness for men's health, especially prostate cancer and men's mental health.
The Distinguished Gentleman Ride was founded in Sydney, Australia by Mark Hawe.
It was inspired by a photo of Mad Man's Don Draper, equipped with a classic bike and dressed in his best.
Hundreds of people attended this year's London event and traveled across Tower Bridge - including a formidable duckshund dog named Sergeant Pepper.
Tennis star Boris Baker says he has been treated for a type of skin cancer
Boris Baker thanked the doctors who successfully removed skin cancer.
In Baker's photos he appeared with a small plaster that could only be seen through his sunglasses.
'It was a regular test, it looks worse than it is,' he told a German publication.
After tennis great player Boris Baker was revealed by his doctors to have a type of skin cancer, a photograph was taken of him with a plaster on his nose.
The tennis star tweeted on Wednesday in German about her health problems: 'I want to thank Martina Meer-Bruen of Munich and Dr. Katie Meyer, who successfully treated me.'
Sunday's photos of the 50-year-old showed him with a small plaster that could only be seen through his sunglasses.
"I went to the dermatologist on Monday, where I had basal cell carcinoma cut", Baker told Germany's Publication Image.
'It was a regular test and it looks worse than it is.'
Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, responsible for 75% of cases.
If diagnosed in time, the patient has a good chance of recovery.
Baker is in the process of divorcing his 42-year-old wife, Lily Baker, after announcing their split in May.
The tennis star has won six major singles titles, 13 Masters Series titles and an Olympic gold medal.
He was recently seen enjoying with friends at the 185th Oktoberfest in Munich.
A 24-year-old hammer thrower kills unknown persons while 'slandering' on a train platform
British female athlete has been killed today for being 'bodied' by a stranger on a train platform.
Jessica Mayho, who won a silver medal in the hammer throw event at the British Athletics Championships this year, says she was humiliated at Leeds Station on Friday afternoon.
Ms Mayho, 24, who stands 5 feet 11 inches tall, said a man had struck her and insulted her while waiting for the train.
The attacker then commented on his 'big body' on the platform just before 5 pm.
But the rising athletics star, who aims to compete for Team GB at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, faced that man.
Miss Mayho of Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: 'I stood up for myself when the rest of the busy platforms avoided eye contact.
People like this can scare you and even reduce your confidence but this is my body and my machine.'
The young athlete has gained support on social media after posting about his attack on Twitter.
Andy Lewis MBE wrote: 'Big body!!!!
Was he drunk or blind?
What a fool, Jess, nothing is wrong with you.
Don't give your time to a small-minded fool.'
Gavin Gray added: 'It is disgusting.
Not only that, but also the people who stood nearby ignored this.
It's good that you're okay.
You are an inspiration to the next generation.
It says, 'Be proud of what you are and if you have a problem with me, go to the rent.'
Miss Mayho, who works at the University of Leeds, was introduced to the hammer throw game by her older sister's coach as a teenager.
She has since been a runner-up at the Muller Senior British Athletic Championships held in Birmingham in July.
The British silver medal came a month after North England became champions.
She has been contacted for further comment but she refused.
Facebook faced fines of up to £1.25 billion after at least 50 million users were hacked.
Criminals took advantage of a security flaw to access at least 50 million Facebook accounts
But this big break was announced on Friday, three days after it happened.
Facebook must now be prepared for heavy fines under new European data laws
Facebook could be fined up to £1.25 billion for hacking at least 50 million accounts.
Criminals have used a security flaw to access accounts, putting a huge amount of sensitive, personal information at risk.
But Facebook announced the breach on Friday, three days after the incident - and was unable to say how many British accounts were affected until last night.
As the search for hackers continued, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner - who regulates the European data compliance of this web giant as its headquarters in Dublin - said, criticizing the company: "There is a lack of detail in the notification".
Facebook will now be prepared for heavy fines under the new EU data law, which may require companies to pay up to four percent of its global turnover.
Facebook made a profit of £31.2 billion last year.
The scammers gained access to accounts through Facebook's "View As" feature that allows users to see how their profiles look when others see them.

Gondal: A father from a rural area came to Gondal's government hospital to treat the eyes of a three-year-old girl.
Instead of giving Masoom the child eye treatment, the service girls were getting angry and were drunk and were reported to the police but the police did not respond.
A child was taken to the hospital to be treated for eye problems.
According to the reports, the head of the Shivam Public Trust, Dinesh Bhai Madha, serving the poor patients at Govt. Hospital in Gondal, said that this morning Sumar came from a rural area to treat his three-year-old Masoom but was so drunk with alcohol that he did not realize that the Masoom was suffering from eye diseases.
But this Naradham did not know anything about this incident. We also informed the city police by telephone to prevent anything from happening to the child. But the police had two responsibilities.
In the present times, there are incidents of child abuse often the parents are responsible for these cases. Even if someone took his child from this drunkard, he did not realize it and the police also responded irresponsibly that we can do something about it.

A lion missing in the Bharaman area, Forest Department notified
The fear of an elderly lion being ill, concern among lion lovers
The Rabarika round of the Tulsiyam range is a round without a master.
A pair of lions have been living here for a long time in the Revenue area known as the Great Barman's Gorge, which is down here from the Ridey Patti Bit.
Both lions live together and hunt together.
However, a lion has been missing for two days and has been reported to the Forest Department by local farmers.
A lion has been reported missing from the revenue area of Raidi Patti Bith, downstream of Rabarika Round of Tulsiyam Range.
There are more than 15 lions living in this round.
The two lions live in the edge area of the two pairs of lions.
Just four days ago, these two lions had slaughtered a calf near the sub-station of the big Barman village and enjoyed a feast.
The raised mares were moved to a safe place not by the forest department but by the local people.
The pair of lions were then seen here for 2 days.
But for the last 48 hours, no lion has been seen in the pair of lions.
The people of the area have been touched.
The forest department is sitting in the office and conducting the survey despite informing the forest department.
While the possibility of a lion getting a thinner stoma instead of a thicker stoma is being discussed among local farmers.
It is also necessary to take samples of more than 15 lions from the area and send them to the forensic lab.
Wouldn't it be surprising if this happened again like lions are catching the death of a dog in the Dalkhania range?
Samples needed to be sent to the laboratory
One forest department employee, on condition of anonymity, said that more than 15 lions are inhabiting the Rabarika round of Tulsiyam Range.
It is seen to be quite thinner than it should be.
When the lions get diarrhea and the body begins to weaken, it is necessary to locate all these lions as soon as possible and send a sample to the forensic lab to find out why this lions are not getting thick.

Seated inspection in an officer's office
The Tulsishyam Range RFO Paramal Patel avoided picking up the phone when he was being called to ask about the incident.
And as if nothing had happened, they were sitting in the office checking.
This is being reported from forestry sources.
Lion reported illness: Sudani
In a telephone conversation with Shivlal Sudani, who reported to the forest department of Bharaman, he said that these are both lions and a pair of bellies.
I had not seen one of these lions for the last 2 days and I was told by the Forest Department that the lion was ill.
A police squadron has arrived at the scene and arrested 5 persons.
Ahmedabad: Stone-stoning at a shop in the Ohdov area of the city.
More than 50 people have attacked and stoned a young man who did not open a shop in the Vijay Estate of Odav.
Two people were injured in the stoning.
As soon as the incident was reported, a police squad arrived at the scene and arrested 5 persons.
The forest and its supporters may be responsible for the deaths of lions.
When a team from Delhi and Dehradun came to investigate to cover up the incident, the bones of a carriage of animals from this holy place were removed from here.
Hittendra Singh Rathod, Khampa: A statewide outcry has been heard over the deaths of 23 lions in the Darya Vadi of Dalkhania Range in the Ghir East.
The forest department has no concrete information about the incident, despite the fact that it has been more than two weeks.
The incident is being diverted by banishing other healthy lions in the name of the virus.
According to reports, the forest department and its supporters are being blamed for the deaths of the lions.
According to sources, the lions are likely to have succumbed to severe virus hunting due to eating the dead bodies of 14 sick goats, 2 cows and 1 bat that died in the strike, which were placed near the windmill in Naria Vd.
The forestry department officials try to suppress the case.
The corrupt forestry officials are also duty-bound officials and employees to expose the forestry department responsible for the incident.

Lions get the virus from eating dead animals: Forest official
A forest official, on condition of anonymity, said that 7 lions are being shown dead in infighting, while 16 other lions have died from the virus.
The virus was introduced by eating dead animals thrown into the larvae of lions that died from the virus.
By the time the forest department learned of the incident, the lions had already been infected with the virus.
However, it is difficult to determine how many lions ate this meat.
Learn more about the bones of dead animals removed and how the virus spread when the Delhi team arrived
US sends CDV virus vaccine from Rajkot to Junaigarh to save lions
The accused cannot come out until the CBI or CID investigate the incident.
The bones of the dead animals were removed when the Delhi team arrived.
Currently, about 30 lions have been captured from the forest and are being held in Jasadhar Animal Care and the incident is being diverted.
The officer further said that when a team from Delhi and Dehradun came to investigate the incident, the bones of a carriage of animals from this holy place were removed.
The operation was carried out with the help of interstate workers to keep the lions from being killed.
A forest department official, on condition of anonymity, said that 14 dead sick goats from Virpur village, 2 sick cows from Govindpur and 1 stray goose from a village were laid here near the windmill in Sarasiya Vadi 28 days ago.
The virus was introduced by eating dead animals thrown into the nest of dead lions.
The virus has spread after eating dogs or other meat animals.
It is true that the virus spreads after eating a dog or other carnivorous animal, but in the sunlight if eaten by a dog or other animal, it also disappears within seconds of counting the bacteria in the animal's saliva.
If a dog eats the animal's carcass and the animal eats the lion or wild animal, the virus enters the animal directly.
A couple in the Philippines were shocked when they saw their baby, because it was born without a face.
A rare type of physical disorder that affects one in about 20,000 embryos.
The parents of the child say that this is due to the side effect of the drug.
On the one hand, the father was horrified by the knowledge of the child, while on the other, the mother lost her mind.
Doctors did not expect her to live much longer, although she still lives after all the problems and recently she also celebrated her first birthday.
This story is of Matthew Gilado, a one-year-old son of Raven and his wife Isabel, who live in the Philippines.
who was born without a face last year.
This is due to a very rare type of congenital disorder.
The disease caused the cranial vault in Matthew's brain to become unstable during pregnancy and his face to become unstable.
Then his face looks like a bomb has exploded inside his head.
When the baby's mother Isabel Gillado went to get her first ultrasound in July last year, the report found doctors to be less likely to see a fetus alive.
However, despite all the problems and fears of doctors, she was born on October 3 last year.
According to the couple, Isabelle had a fever in the first month of pregnancy.
He then took a drug called Bioflu for a week.
It is made from a combination of phenylephrine HCI, chlorphenamine narrate and paracetamol.
The couple thinks that the baby's face may have been damaged by this drug.
The lack of a proper face in shape also causes many problems in feeding and drinking a child.
It has to be dripped and milk brewed.
He also has to be given vitamin pills to keep him healthy.
The father was terrified to see the child's face.
Matthew was born in a hospital in Santiago, Spain, through surgery.
"When I first saw our baby", says the father, "I panicked, started to feel weak and almost fell into the delivery room.
He had no face.
Even after giving birth to her, Matthew was discharged from the hospital the next day, while her mother, Isabel, had to stay in the ICU for two weeks.
Raven says that we wanted to touch our child physically and feel it, we wanted to kiss and hug him so we named him Matthew.
The Bible says that "the gift of God" means "gift of God".
The father's financial situation is not better.
She works in a clothing factory in Quezon City and earns about Rs 9,000 a month.
Due to his low income, Raveen has to seek help from relatives and people to meet Matthew's needs.
In May of this year, Matthew was taken to a large hospital in Manila for treatment, where he was admitted for about 3 weeks.
After several tests, doctors refused to operate on her.
He said that his fragile body could not withstand major surgery because he weighed only 4.9 kg.
Doctors say nothing, but even the baby's mother, Isabella, did not give up hope.
He is confident that one day Matthew will be fine.
"He is fighting for his life", says Isabel, "and we are not losing hope.
We are fighting and we are confident that one day, by the grace of God and the excellence of medical science, I will see it with a good face.

Antonia Scalia 'won't be surprised' by 'Mad Libs protest' against Cavenaw, son said
The son of former Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia told Fox News on Sunday that his father, thanks to his so-called broad supreme court power in modern life, would not have been shocked by the bias in his father over the nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
"Generally, he wouldn't be too surprised about the intensity of the Supreme Court nomination, because very little of it comes down to Row v. Wade - at least the way that left represents it", Christopher Scalia said, referring to a landmark 1973 case that women have a constitutional right to an abortion within a certain quarter.
In a shocking move, Roe prevented states from making their own decisions about how to effectively control abortion, and many states immediately took steps in response to try to restrict abortion rights.
"My father, along with Roe v. Wade, repeatedly said that especially in other cases, that the court was actually trying to get in and settle a cultural issue that should have been settled in elections and in the legislative process", he added during his appearance in Fox & Friends.
"Trying to shorten the process, the Supreme Court did more damage and as a result, the Supreme Court's nomination and confirmation battles became even hotter, as the judiciary took on the role that comes with legislatures".
Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Cesse raised the same issue during Cavanow's confirmation hearing earlier this month, when he reiterated that Congress largely represents the power of the majority of irresponsible executive branch agencies and leaves the Supreme Court to effectively determine the resulting bureaucratic uncertainties that would force the legislatures to supplement the justices abandoned by senators.
Hundreds of protesters were accused and arrested by the Capitol Hill Police for improperly interfering in this confirmation proceedings.
Asked if Cavanow had any chance to avoid such negative reactions - which now focus primarily on unsubstantiated allegations that were linked to sexual misconduct a decade ago - Scalia said the mess was unlikely to be avoided.
Responding to claims that Cavendish was serving on the Supreme Court during an inquiry by senators on Thursday about critical allegations against him and sometimes because of defamatory behavior, Scalia suggested that the justice does not always have a calm mood.
Scalia, referring to sometimes hot-button cases, said, "It's not so rare to get angry for justice".
"It's true that Judge Cavendish was perhaps more aggressive, but it was because the circumstances were so different.
He defended his good name against unsubstantiated accusations".
Kavanaugh was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday to move towards a full Senate floor vote by a party-line 11-10 vote.
In dramatic moments, San. Jeff Flack, R.A.R. said he would only give his decisive swing vote in favor of Kavanaugh if the FBI were given a week to investigate the current and credible misconduct claims against Kavanaugh.
That investigation is ongoing, and President Trump has said the agency has broad authority to interview "whoever he wants".
Modi has been charged with showing a mark of camel during the seventh phase of voting in Gujarat and other states.
After the incident, Congress has said to move forward with the case.
The Congress has said that if Modi wins the election by a wide margin, it is likely that he will go to court to cancel Modi's candidacy.
In response to the case, Narendra Modi said that this is a sign of Congress's frustration.
He said that this made them feel troubled that a tea grower was challenging them.
Addressing the public assembly in Thiruvananthapuram, Andhra Pradesh, Modi said that no complaint has ever been filed against him.
I will never forget the day of April 30.
It is understandable that a man shows a handgun, pistol or a handgun.
But they know the cause of my accusation, because I showed them the flower of camel.
It is worth mentioning that an FIR was filed against BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi in a case of violation of the Code of Conduct.
After voting in Gujarat on Wednesday, Narendra Modi addressed the media by showing the party's electoral sign.
The Congress had lodged a complaint against this with the Election Commission.
The Commission has confirmed the verdict after an investigation.
However, Modi had just addressed a rally saying what is wrong with me showing the sign.
The fact is that the Congress has now struck as if it were scared.

He said that no technology company has ever achieved the record of doubling the number of users in just 22 months of launch anywhere in the world, adding that data usage on Jio's network has increased from 125 crore gigabytes (GB) to 240 crore GB.

Shri Ambani said that our new Hybrid New Commerce Platform is aimed at promoting the sharing of prosperity.
Talking about business and financial performance, Shri Mukesh Ambani said that our new-age consumer business has also started to make a profit.
Our hydrocarbon business (refining and petrochemicals) has become more profitable, integrated and revenue-generating by increasing its capacity.

The company's consumer business - Jio and Retail - account for 13 percent of the pre-tax and pre-tax revenue, up from just 2 percent previously.

The journey of Oil-to-Chemicals, which began in 1996-1999, has taken a backseat to the launch of the world's largest refinery of gas crackers and paracelin complexes and this new project has changed the definition of oil-to-chemical integration.
Noting the efforts being made by the Reliance Foundation to promote sport at the ground level, she congratulated Mrs. Nita Ambani on the National Sports Promotion Award presented by the President of India.

Air India's problems increased, pilots threatened strike
Air India's cash-strapped problem is not being called a downturn.
According to the news, the company's regional pilot unit has threatened to go on strike.
The unit said that if the salary is delayed, it will stop cooperating with the management.
The bad impact on the daily lives of staff
In a letter to the Central Executive Committee of Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), the Regional Executive (REC) said that their disagreement will continue until the salary is paid on time.
It is worth mentioning that the airline has postponed the salary of 11 thousand Ampoys of the company for the third consecutive month.
The letter said that the REC had held a meeting on June 6 in Delhi.
Delays in salary are having a negative impact on the daily lives of staff.
The people who have borrowed are being harassed by financial institutions for installments.

Air India employees are usually paid on 30 and 31st of each month.
Fantastic frogs rule in a ready-made sleepy range
The Bible says that "the world is full of falsehood".
It is a question for the house of Shyparelli.
The Paris Couture House, founded by Elsa Schipperelli about a century ago, has launched ready-to-wear clothing and handbags.
For a label that has always celebrated the fantastic rather than the wearable, this is as famous an idea as Elsa Schipperelli's famous hat that was shaped like a top-turned shoe.
Despite a long history of cunning so far, there is something modern about this fashion house.
Aesthetically, they're emoji-like, all lobster shaped, heart and eyes shaped.
Shyperly designed the first jumpsuit in 1930, and was the first to set the catwalk show to music.
It was Shaparelli and her friend Salvador Dali who discovered the art-fashion collaboration, currently partnering with U.S. artist Sterling Ruby with Calvin Klein and Raf Simons.
Legend has it that Dalí wanted the lobster-embroidered evening gown that he and Shaipareli had made to be displayed in a salon with a dressing of real mayonnaise, but was refused.
Strapless dress on a black buster with a man-ray electricit design.
The first is the "Sleeping Beauty".
"We want to rethink this idea of collaboration, which is part of Shapperley's history", said Bertrand Guyen, who has been creative director at the salon of Place Wendom's home for the past three years.
For the Ready-to-Wear collection, he took Shaparelli's friendship with Man Ray as a starting point and created clothing based on iconic artworks in partnership with the Man Ray Foundation.
Glass tears, a famous close-up of a pair of artist's eyes, appear on a white T-shirt filled with perspex teardrops, while a floating red lip appears from the observation time: Lovers look at a collage-like, silk-screened shift dress.
Men's Glass Tears appears on a T-shirt from one of the collection.
One of Elsa's tunes is the character S. Shocking Pink, which is her signature color, is inspired by her perfume, Shocking.
Shyperly's first handbag, which was created by Guyan with a keyhole design, is called a secret.
It will be available at a fantastic retail price of £5,000.
The surreal side of Paris Fashion Week was also displayed yesterday in a pop-up shop at a warehouse on the left bank of the Seine, which had just sold a €100 rag at Virgil Abloh's IKEA collection.
Half an hour before the opening, Abloh's younger 500 fans had a strong lineup with Quay, excited by the prospect of buying one of their designs without the spirit tags coming from their Louis Vuitton menswear.
For Abloh, the project opens up communication channels with a wider audience rather than providing luxury fashion or designer furniture.
"No one owns anything more, but if you know a particular chair it's part of your dinner conversation.
He recently said it is the "train of thought" of the millennium.
As audiences began to zoom in on skateboards in a garage in Marys, past models made it clear that this was not the day for a typical catwalk show.
Andrea Cronthler, husband of Vivian Westwood and a designer in her own right, considered the portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson of the Lady Skateboards in Kabul to be the starting point for seeing men and women in colorful loose clothing.
Some women - and a few men - skated in heeled muzzle sandals, however, they were on their feet in rounded platform boots.
Westwood, who saw a horse-printed dress from the collection from the very first line and an orange cardigan tied around her waist, joined her husband in a catwalk for his final bow, where she presented him with a rose.
The powerful connections of twins - in pictures
Detroit-born, London-based photographer Peter Zelewski began a career in street photography before turning to twins four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and a human, I have always been fascinated by twins, who have been hearing from us about the wonderful bond", he explains.
It was never intended as a complete project, but "when I took a portrait of the first set of twins it became a big addiction and there was no way back from there".
Zelewski's next book, Twins, features 44 sets of images and stories of identical twins.
The project is primarily a visual type, he says: "It is not a documentary or a scientific project - my main goal was to create powerful, emotional portraits of people".
Nurses pass a vote of no confidence in the union on pay-deal handling
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, angry at the handling of changes to the NHS pay deal, voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the organisation on charges of misrepresenting the expected pay rise.
Former Secretary General Janet Davis admitted that it came after a lengthy story within the RCN that she had mistakenly told members to raise salaries by 3% immediately this year after the end of the 1% pay cap.
Many were disappointed that the members did not receive the expected salary increase, which led to Davis falling under pressure from members, resulting in a vote of no confidence in the college council at an emergency general meeting in Birmingham on Friday.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham cleared the air and the college will emerge as strong as a result", said Maria Trevorne, chair of the RCN.
"This vote is clear and the Council and management of the RCN have received a message.
In recent weeks the Council has already been in the organisation, listening more closely to members and engaging them better, driving change - and this will continue".
A meeting will be held next week and it is expected that the members of the RCN Council will return.
"Nursing is based on trust", an NHS nurse told the Guardian.
"The RCN Council's actions have destroyed our faith and they must go.
I hope that they will take respectful steps and follow the request.
I look forward to seeing if members of other organisations are looking for a similar solution".
Rachel Harrison, GMB National Officer for the NHS, told the Guardian in August: "Up and down the country, NHS employees have been exposing their pay gaps and realizing they haven't gotten the pay rise they thought they would.
And they are angry".
Before the extraordinary meeting, the RCNA admitted that it made several mistakes in the process of the 2018 salary deal and its communication matter.
However, it is stated that the RCN's "Scrape the Cap" campaign forced the government to end the pay cap, which was only a 6.5% increase on pay, which will now be introduced in three years.
The vote came after an independent report that RCAN's offer of the deal was biased towards its acceptance, while Davis was accused of "close" the deal's investigation.
It is claimed that the RCN presented information containing "false facts", which means that members could not make an informed decision on the transaction, while alternative options were not examined.
The RCNA has published conflicting information on whether a 3% increase will apply to all members.
In a separate briefing of the RCAN to Congress, the delegates were wrongly told that "3% growth will be achieved, as well as growth will be increased by improvement".
In fact, a 3% increase involves a steady increase in wages and, in any case, only a few of the top employees in their pay band will immediately increase it.
The spokesperson for the Electoral Reform Services who conducted the report said that information given to members about the implementation of the deal after the Congress (possibly as a result of an effort to simplify the message) was inaccurate.
"The IRS believes that the failure to inform informed decision makers of the current decision, which was clearly compared to the briefly proposed deal, hampers informed decision as it failed to provide a clear reference to the headline benefits, with figures of 6.5% and 29%, used during the campaign".
The motion of no confidence passed with 78% against 3.74% of the votes cast by the members of the RCN.
Lindsay Lohan, Instagram disrupts live audiences as she tries to 'kidnapp' family children in the street
Lindsay Lohan is being criticized for trying to separate homeless poor street children from their parents after posting a live video on Instagram.
Probably a live video actor shot in Moscow (based on previous Instagram story updates of Lohia) offers to roof off a family head at night, but the situation soon becomes full.
"Hello friends, I just want to show you a family that I met", she told the audience, "a Syrian refugee family that I'm really concerned about.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Come with me, I'll take care of you", she tells the family before turning to a child:" Would you like to stay in a hotel tonight?
Do you want to watch movies?
It will be a lot of fun to watch a movie on TV or computer".
When the parents refuse, Lohan becomes furious.
She says, "You shouldn't keep your sons on the ground, you should work hard and do what you can for your children, so they can have a better life".
"If anyone gives you a house and a bed, give it to him as I do.
They will come back to you.
I will not leave here until I take you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't mess with me".
When the family tries to escape from Lohan, he follows her, still streaming live on Instagram.
"Look, what's going on, they're trafficking children. You're spoiling Arab culture by doing this".
"You're taking these kids, they want to go.
Children, I am with you, do not worry, the whole world is watching".
At the end of the video, the situation becomes a nuisance when Mother Lohan is seen crowding with her.
Clip clips of the video have started to spread on social media, with some users suggesting that the incident was an attempted kidnapping.
The Independent has contacted the representative of Lohane for comment.
One third of Britons believe they will never pay off their debts
About a third of Britons believe they will never be able to repay their debt in their lifetime and more than one in 10 say they will not even be able to reduce their debt levels.
Research by Equifax and Gorkana, especially seen by The Independent, shows that people aged 18 to 24 in particular believe they are facing a lifetime of debt, with only half of those saying they will ever be able to go back to black.
According to a report released last year by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, students graduate with an average debt of £46,000, and students from the poorest backgrounds graduate with debts of over £57,000.
In fact, most graduates - 81 percent - will never fully repay their debt, which means they will spend the first 30 years of their working life with debt hanging over them.
The level of debt in society as a whole is rising; figures from the Office for National Statistics show that domestic debt is record high in the UK, while Britons spend more than £900 per year earning.
But how should we worry about this panic of depression-inducing statistics?
Has a lifelong relationship with debt become a new normal now - not just for young adults, but for the entire population?
For example - often the biggest purchase we make after home (if we're lucky) is a car.
This week, the AutoTrader predicted that all new cars will be purchased at a decade's expense, the way we expect to pay for our motoring changes.
Gini Boyle, director of Equity Investors and chartered financial planner, definitely believes that expectations have changed.
"Debt is now definitely more common - credit cards are more prevalent, and so are zero percent balance transfers, student loans, and daily payday lenders", she says.
"It was a shame to be in debt to our grandparents' generation".
In recent times, student loans and home prices are usually in debt.
Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, agrees and says the outcome could be worrying.
"If you have to buy a property worth four or five times your income, it's a big sum, adding a little more debt to it doesn't seem like a big deal", he explains.
And people will be in trouble here.
Interest rates have been very low for many years and people with large mortgages or other debts should be aware that they need to be aware when rates rise.
It is probably understandable that critics of the finance industry seem to be reliable.
"Debt is not a bad word", says Brian Brody, chief executive of the agency Loan Freedom Finance.
To buy a home improvement or a new car, borrowing is no longer seen as a "last resort".
Low interest rates have prompted many people to lock their savings into fixed-term accounts, which yield high returns, but reduce savings access.
As a result, the debt of the "middle class" is increasing.
In the last six months, half of our new loans were taken by customers with "excellent" credit ratings.
For Richard Hames, head of financial difficulties at Equiflex company TDX Group, this expectation of lifetime debt is a clear concern.
"Inflation reached a six-month high of 2.7 percent in August", he says, "with recent interest rate hikes and rising limited wages, there is growing concern that large numbers of people are borrowing without a realistic expectation of being able to repay".
According to our analysis, personal bankruptcy will increase by 17 per cent this year and the main contributing factor is the record level of consumer credit.
Debt can be managed when people work and earn, but there is concern about what lifelong well-being can mean for old age.
Research conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with Equity Release Expert More 2 Life shows that unsecured debt among 55 to 74 year olds has increased by more than a third in the last four years, which is twice the national average.
And the most common form for this age group is credit cards, which cost 30 percent more than monthly payments.
Boyle adds: "We are seeing more and more people using pension freedom to pay off debts at age 55, which affects their well-being in retirement.
Often this is the only savings that have effectively "forced" it to do so.
People also think they'll use equity to pay it off later on in their property - but this is problematic because it's not always necessary to get the money you expect.
Future decline in property process will accelerate this.
Serena Williams sings "I Touch Myself" as a topless to raise breast cancer awareness
Serena Williams has released a video in which she sang the classic Divine's song "I Touch Myself" in which she covered her open chest with her hand.
The tennis star shared the clip on her Instagram page explaining that she has created a video to encourage women to check their breasts.
"This breast cancer awareness month I recorded a version of The Divine's global hit "I Touch Myself" to remind women to regularly self-check", Williams wrote.
"Yes, this has taken me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it's a problem that affects women of all colors around the world.
Early tapes are important - they save many lives.
I hope this helps women to remember".
Williams continues: "The music video is part of the "I Touch Myself Project" that was created in honor of Diva, Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer, and the hit song she gave to remind women to prioritize health in their dreams".
The project, supported by the lingerie brand Berley for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), was launched in 2014 after Amphlett's death at the age of 53.
After posting the video on her Instagram account, it has been viewed more than 1.5 million times by fans praising the tennis superstar for performing the song.
"For this very love and for what you have done by giving yourself".
Thanks Serena", one person wrote.
Another added: "I really liked this, Serena.
I am a 20-year-old breast cancer survivor and I found a tumor on my self-examination even though the mammogram showed nothing.
Tests are very important.
Thank you for getting yourself out of the comfort zone - you're a goddess!"
As part of the "I Touch Myself Project", Burley also releases a new snackskin print, Bra, inspired by a rock star named The Chrissy.
100% of the profits from the BRA will be donated to BCNA.
When self-checking, it is important to know the signs and symptoms you need.
Along with the glands, other signs of breast cancer include breast size or shape, spots or skin scarring, breast lump discharge, holes in the skin, persistent pain, or changes in skin composition.
Similarly, swelling around the bulge or collar-bone can be an indicator, such as a growing tendon or an upturned breast tendon.
Women are advised to check their breasts every month.
If you notice any symptoms of breast cancer, the NHS advises that you meet your GP as soon as possible.
After testing, your GP will advise you to go to a specialist breast cancer clinic if they feel your symptoms need further evaluation.
Adam Driver is so good at this SNL skittish that the cast can't keep a straight face.
Adam Driver was the guest host of Saturday Night Live this week, and he actually did 110% performance.
The entertaining sketches of the show are always those that are not in a particular current event, and the same was true of the new sketch "Career Day".
The day in American high school focuses on "Bring Your Father to Work", where teenage Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees to talk to his aging oil-laden father, Abraham H. Parnasus (Adam Driver).
Struggling with a stick, Parnasus proceeds to show the acute responsibilities of oil industry dominance, perhaps with self-empowerment inspired by Daniel Plainview, the character from Daniel Day-Lewis' "There Will Be Blood".
Parnasas said to the students, "I was born seven months ago, very early".
"Incubation technology was just beginning, so they put me in a cast iron pot inside a pizza oven until I was mature enough to walk.
My bones were never strong, but my spirit was made strong.
Be strong and crush your enemies".
Davidson, along with fellow SNL member Eddie Bryant, who plays the school teacher, struggles to keep his face straight and does not appear to be a sharply eye-catching driver.
Although the Star Wars actor is in full force, nevertheless, he is becoming more and more of a fighter as he recalls his personal battle with Oil Baron rival HR Pickens.
"I married your granddaughter!" he exclaims.
"She has grown your boy by filling her stomach with my sharp seeds, it is my ultimate revenge, HR!"
Within five minutes, Parnasus became as thrilling as the character of Adam Driver as Keelo Raine did in two feature films.
"You are cursed, HR!"
Kendrick Lamar Leak: Eight unheard songs came online
Kendrick Lamar appears to have suffered a significant leak of unreleased songs.
Eight never-before-heard songs featuring guest lines from SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul began to circulate overnight on the Internet on Saturday.
It's unclear where they came from, and the nickname under which this collection is circulating, "Bad Kid Chill City EP", and not whether the artwork (which appears to have been created by a fan) is authentic.
These songs, which may be demos and only half finished, appear to have been recorded at different points in Lamar's career.
"Gang Member" seems to be from the Good Kid Mad City era, while the SZA-inspired "Heroin" sounds around the Dam/Black Panther soundtrack.
The songs from the revised collection are as follows:
Gang member
The Only Nigga
Wanted in Life
Love One (shining to SZA)
On This City
Heroine (including SZA, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad, and Ab Soul)
Look over your shoulders (featuring Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson)
Swimming pools alternate
The Independent has contacted a representative of Kendrick Lamar for comment.
Three people disappeared after a break in northern Juneau's Lutia Bay.
A search was underway on Saturday after three people went missing after a helicopter crash in north Juneau, Alaska.
One person was rescued after the crash on Friday, but three others are still missing.
A helicopter crashed near Lutia Bay, northwest of Juneau.
The helicopter on a long-distance journey from Grand Prairie, Texas, was designated Airbus H125.
Fragments of aircraft were found 100 feet off shore on Friday.
According to the Associated Press, one of the rescued was identified as a 14-year-old.
Surviving Gayle was diagnosed with hypothermia but was otherwise fine.
The helicopter was carrying two adults and two teenagers when it crashed.
The missing persons were identified as David King, 53, Josh Pepard, 42, and Andrew Pepard, 11, according to KTVA.
Big Paperd was named president of Davis Constructors & Engineers, an Alaska-based construction company.
It is not clear why the clash occurred.
The National Transportation Safety Board said that an investigation is underway.
According to KTVA, Coast Guard officials said in a statement that "two adults and two teenagers were on board the crashed helicopter, which was reported to be brand new from the factory".
The pilot has 40 years of flying experience including both Alaska flight time, fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky said that loved ones were hoping for a miracle.
Rescuers continue the search with the help of a Coast Guard helicopter for two experienced climbers who disappeared on Ben Nevis in Fort William, Scotland on February 17, 2016.
Three people were searching Saturday after a helicopter crash in Alaska.
"I have been sexually abused".
President Kelley Conway's adviser said on Sunday morning she was the victim of sexual assault.
Conway responded to a sharp exchange during the last week of testimony by Supreme Court nominee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and defendant, Christine Blasey Ford.
In response, Conway emotionally disclosed that she herself had been a victim of sexual assault in the past and defended Kavanaugh for hosting Jack Tapper, saying she believed the sexual assault charges against her were "personally selected".
"I feel deeply for the victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.
I am a victim of sexual assault", Conway told CNN's State of the Union program on Sunday.
"I'm a victim of sexual assault, I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh or Jack Tapper or Jeff Flake or anyone else to be responsible for it.
You have to be responsible for your behavior".
Conway dismissed the network as a "dirty" to compare the charges against Cavanow, which were directed at Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in a Pennsylvania state prison last week.
Conway also protested against the Senate Judiciary Committee's inability to remove former President Bill Clinton from office despite oral sex in the Oval Office and direct "lying about it" to the American people.
Kevanou and Ford's testimony divided America, poll shows
There are differences in the testimony of Brett Cavanow and his prosecutor, accused Christine Blasey Ford, in the United States, in which Ford claims that a Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers.
And the number of people who believed Ford or Cavenaugh spoke the same, with 38 percent saying they believed Cavenaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both sides after Ford sent a letter detailing his allegations against Senator Diane Feinstein.
When the letter was released, Ford and Cavenaugh said they would be ready to speak to the committee.
During her testimony, Ford said she was 100 percent sure that Kevenou was the one who tried to attack her at a domestic party in the early 1980s and that it could have been a case of mistaken identity.
In an emotional opening statement, the 51-year-old said she felt it was her civic duty to come forward.
"I'm scared", she said.
"I'm here because I believe it's my civic duty to tell you what happened to me when Brett Cavanow and I were in high school".
Cavenaugh, who denied the allegations made by Ford, as well as two other women accused of sexual abuse, said: "I have never sexually assaulted anyone - not in high school, not in college, not ever".
"Something - anyone - has been stirred up to come out - no matter how far away or unpleasant, it will block my nomination", he said.
"This is a last-minute stain, pure and simple".
Without a doubt, the results of the U.G. poll, which surveyed 2,607 people on September 27-28, were divided on party lines, with Democrats believing more in Ford than Democrats believed in Kevinou (14 percent vs 11 percent), despite the odds of Democrats believing Ford (73 percent) and Republicans believing Cavenaugh (74 percent) with more votes.
The founder of Body Worlds, known as "Dr. Death", wants to cut himself and put himself on his own show.
The German scientist, who invented the plantation, wants to become a permanent part of his body worlds exhibition after his death.
Gunther Von Hegens pioneered the technique, which allowed the display of cadavers, skulls and organs in exhibitions around the world that ran around the world and fueled surprise and controversy.
Now finally ill with cancer, the 73-year-old has instructed his wife to plasticise it after his death to become a permanent fixture at the Body Worlds exhibition, which will open to the public this week in London.
It somehow finalizes his life's work.
Angelina Whaley told the Observer that now I understand that it is more an expression of appreciation and love for me.
She said her husband had given strict instructions on what to do with her body in a process that took about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries need to be open, the body will be injected with silicone and then put into position.
"He said to me, 'Angelina, you have the right to keep me cold for a year to -25 degrees Celsius, but after that time you really have to put your hands on me because otherwise I will burn again.'"
So I have a year to grieve and then I have to do it".
Then, ideally, wearing her trademark Fedora hat, she would join the exhibition at the London Pavilion, at which point the other corpse would be in a cold and tattered posture as if riding a horse or playing cards.
When a live autopsy was performed in public for the first time in 170 years on British television, von Hegens gained fame in the UK.
Since 1995 to date, 47 million people worldwide have visited editions of Body Worlds.
Peterc, founder of Body Worlds London, told The Guardian that the 28,000 square foot exhibition space is 100% based on donations received from people who have "consented to help and educate in life, to help people see what could go wrong".
We see and read many scary things that frighten us with death.
We're all going to get there, that's what we're all going to get, we're all going to die, and I think the body worlds show us that you don't have to be afraid", Tabernall said.
Ronaldo's lawyers threatened the law for allegations of rape
Lawyers for Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo said on Friday they sued a German magazine for alleging "irrelevantly illegal" by an American woman who said Ronaldo raped her in 2009.
Christian Skirts, one of Ronaldo's lawyers, said in a statement that the magazine Der Spiegel's report reported "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy" and that he would take legal action for his client from his magazine.
The statement was sent to Reuters by Robaldi's agent, company Gastifoot, in response to a request for comment on Der Spiegel's article, which was published on Friday.
The Gestapo did not answer any specific questions about the contents of the Der Spiegel report, which Reuters was unable to independently verify.
Der Spiegel first reported on the allegations in April 2017.
The biggest name in the world of sports is Ronaldo, a five-time Player of the World.
He moved from Real Madrid to Juventus, Italy this summer; the Italian club declined to comment on Der Spiegel's report.
According to Leslie Mark Stowell, a lawyer for the accused woman, Katherine Mayorga, the suspected rape took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in June 2009, the magazine said.
According to Stoll and Magazine, Ronaldo and Mayorga then went out of court for a settlement.
In it, Mayorca agreed to a confidentiality agreement for a payment of $375,000 from Ronaldo.
Stovall did not immediately respond to email requests from Reuters for comment on this article, and Mayorga did not respond to telephone calls to her home.
Stovall told Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint to announce the termination of the nondisclosure agreement.
Mayorga told Der Spiegel that she does not feel bound by the agreement that she suffered from the consequences of the night nine years ago.
"I've had such serious breaks before", she told Der Spiegel.
"And again, the rape charge.
And I blame him, and I blame myself for signing that thing".
Freedom through consistent writing professions
Are you ready for Self-Publishing 3.0?
In a new white paper published today at #selfpub3.0, Alliance of Independent Authors for the first time, explains how authors can join a range of other creative entrepreneurs to increase their independence and build sustainable writing careers.
Orna Rose, founder of Alliance of Independent Authors and repeatedly named "One of the 100 Most Influential People in Publishing", will explain why and how authors should adopt Self-Publishing 3.0 at Digital Book World 2018.
"Consumer trends such as personal branding, careful consumption, and the advancement of mobile phone reading combine with digital publishing technology to create more favorable conditions for author-businesses than ever before", says Ross.
But only writers who have developed independent, creative and empowered thinking, who understand the value of their intellectual property, can benefit from these opportunities.
#selfpub3.0 encourages authors to have the diversity to earn income through our own websites, which become the focus of our successful publishing and media ventures.
Revenue flows may include direct sales, subscription models, crowdsourcing assistance, broad distribution models and other revenue streams such as online education and affiliate revenue.
#selfpub3.0 also means using retailers and other services to distribute our books as widely as possible in as many formats as possible.
Most often, #selfpub3.0 is a change in the mindset needed to keep your author's business in control, whether it's a trade publisher or a self-publishing service, rather than handing all of your intellectual property, your most valuable creative assets, over to someone else's owned business.
These are measures that maximize revenue, impact and impression for writers and should be of interest to every writer and publisher working in the digital age, Ross points out, pointing out that real freedom for writers or anyone else, should be in their original professionalism as well as in creative freedom.
This is the future now.
And it's never been so bright for freelance writers.
Self-publishing 1.0 was desktop publishing and print on demand.
Self-publishing 2.0 was for selling e-books to e-readers and phone users through online bookstores.
We are now entering the era of Self-Publishing 3.0. Self-publishers build efficient and sustainable author ventures.
Alliance of Independent Authors is the only global, nonprofit organization of solely self-publishing authors.
ALLi's goal is to promote excellence and ethics in self-publishing; support authors in creating and selling their books; and advocate for author freedom by building sustainable digital businesses.
The President of Italy, the central banker warned the government about the deficit scheme.
The President of Italy and the Governor of its central bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt will remain consistent after the populist government announced plans to significantly increase deficit spending next year.
Late on Thursday, the ruling parties, made up of the anti-act 5-star movement and the Right Wing League, proposed a deficit of 2019, which was 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is three times the target of the previous administration.
The announcement triggered a market surge on Friday, with the sale-offs of bonds and the stock market shrinking.
It also clashed with the European Commission, which oversees and enforces EU financial rules.
President Sergio Mattarella, addressing the group at the Presidential Palace marking the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, noted that the state's constitutional law requires "a balanced budget and debt continuity".
"This is to protect the savings of our fellow citizens", he said.
Shortly after a conference in central Italy, according to the Bank of Italy's Governor Ignasio Visco, the country's debt, at 131 percent of GDP, should not rise to the largest in the major European Union economies.
According to Ansa State News Agency, Visco said, "Italy needs to favor public and private investment and include and reduce public debt".
"God must be put on a path to decay", he added.
The League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini also responded to Matterella that the debts imposed by Brussels have increased over the years.
"Be still, Mr. President", Salvini said in a statement.
"The years of budgetary imposition by Europe have exploded our public debt. We are finally changing course and betting on the future".
Earlier, before speaking about Materella or Visco, 5-star leader Luigi de Mayo said the budget would "repay people for past theft", although he added that the government's intention was not to challenge the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties have also pushed back on Economy Minister Giovanni Triya, an economist who is not affiliated with any group to sign up their plans to increase deficit spending.
Italian media reported that Materella had failed to keep the country below 2% of its GDP.
The President and the Central Bank have no direct role in formulating economic policy.
The 77-year-old president can reject the law and send it back to parliament, but he can only do it once.
Then Parliament can pass it again, unchanged, and it must be signed into law.
Indonesian tsunami sensors missed the big waves: official
The Indonesian Geophysics Agency warned 34 minutes later that the tsunami that hit the northeastern coast of Sulawesi island after a massive earthquake destroyed hundreds and left more than a thousand homeless.
Car wreckage in the tsunami in Palau, Indonesia on 2nd September 2018.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which struck the city of Palú 1,500 kilometres (940 mi) from Jakarta, killed 384 people on the coast.
Officials said on Saturday that the death toll is likely to rise.
Thousands of people gathered for a festival on a beach in Palo on Friday, when waves as high as six metres (18 ft) collided in the evening, killing many.
The Geophysical Agency (BMKG) faced criticism on social media, with many raising questions about the tsunami warning being lifted too soon.
The agency said it followed the standard operating procedure and called for the alert to be "complete" based on data available from the nearest tidal sensor about 200 kilometres (125 mi) from Palou.
"We do not have any observation data in Palou.
So we used the data we had and made the call based on it", said Rahmat Trayono, Head of Earthquake and Tsunami Centre at BMKG.
He said that the closest receding gauge, which brings sea level change, recorded only a six-centimeter (2.5 in) "smaller" wave and is not responsible for the massive waves near Pallu.
"If Pallu had a tidal gauge or the right data, we certainly would have done it.
This is something we have to evaluate for the future", Trino said.
The tsunami, which officials said hit at speeds as high as hundreds of kilometers per hour in Palou and surrounding areas, was not clear before or after the warning was lifted.
Residents are investigating the bodies of their families after the tsunami hit in Palo, Indonesia on September 29, 2018.
"Based on the video being streamed on social media, we suspect that the tsunami occurred before the warning officially expired", Trio said.
The most devastating came on Boxing Day 2004, when a 9.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that killed 1,26,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including 1,26,000 in Indonesia.
The picturesque town of Palu is located at the mouth of a narrow bay in northeastern Sulawesi and is home to about 380,000 people.
According to Indonesia's National Disaster Disaster Agency (BNPB), it was hit by tsunamis in 1927 and 1968.
Geologist researcher Baptist Gombert of Oxford University said the tsunami caused by the earthquake was "amazing".
Friday's quake was recorded as a "strike-slip" event where neighboring tectonic plates move horizontally opposite each other, usually causing a tsunami.
"There is speculation that there was an undersea landslide that displaced much of the water and caused the tsunami", he said. He added that the narrow bay may have concentrated the wave force as it moved towards the shore.
Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told reporters that his team was "preparing to send public alerts" when the tsunami warning "abruptly ended".
The Ministry of Communications said that the residents were repeatedly alerted by text message, but Ngrogo said that the power and communication lines in the area were blocked by the earthquake and there were no sirens on the coast.
The BMKG was taken to social media by Indonesians for its failure to warn of the tsunami and to release information in a timely manner.
"How disturbing... the warning was raised... but the tsunami came... " a Twitter user @zanoguccy told BMKG in a direct message.
Golf: 'Mollywood' gambling set to break box office records
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood won their forum on Saturday to become the first European pair and Europe are on their way to making history by taking a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
They became the first European pair to win all four of their matches after defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson DeChambeau 5 and 4.
Only Larry Nelson and Lenny Waddkins achieved this for the first time for Americans in 1979.
The huge winning margins - 3 & 1, 5 & 4, 4 & 3 and 5 & 4 - still only tell half the story.
His left-handed left-hander was Woods, who is a 14-time major winner, who also had to lose three times, with Patrick Reed sitting on the sidelines twice.
This week's U.S. team form paired up to another win over Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who won three more matches.
Molinari and Fleetwood entered the singles on Sunday and had the chance to become the first European to win five out of five points.
Fleetwood has claimed the most points in a Ryder Cup by a European rookie.
"Mollywood", by a newly acquired army of fans, was at first glance a potential contender for the lead of the European charge in the pair.
Such a performance was not expected from a first-time Ryder Cup winner like Fleetwood, while Molinari failed to win any of his previous six matches, losing all four.
However, a more positive view was that Fleetwood was at number one in Europe last year, knows about the Leigh Golf National Course by winning the French Open in 2017, and showed his great match-playing enthusiasm by finishing second at this year's U.S. Open.
Molinari is a fresh British Open champion and widely regarded as the most consistent ball striker on the European Tour - a trait that has paid a heavy dividend on a roughly elusive path to finding, much the way most Americans do, was the motto for disaster.
That lineage, which was known as a great on-course chemistry, proved to be an indispensable force.
"I feel a little emotional and we're only on Saturday", says the famously made Fleetwood, who has shown an entire weekend game with a huge smile on his face.
We were doing really well this afternoon, playing really hard and well.
It is truly special to have our own history together.
I am just happy that we have done our part for the team".
Molinari was just as happy.
"Playing with Tommy, it's been amazing", he said.
"But we came to do one thing, not to get into the record book, we have to fight hard for those 4-1/2 points that we will need for tomorrow's win; it won't be easy".
The night fever!
An Irish village turned into a medieval battlefield
Once a powerful 15th-century royal fortress, the palace of Claregalway in the west of Ireland, returned to its origins on Saturday.
Knight pairs duel with swords during a medieval war festival at Claregalway Castle in Galway, Ireland on September 29, 2018.
The original medieval war zone of the completely restored Anglo-Norman era tower house was transformed as thousands of enthusiastic visitors, many from around the world, reintroduced full contact fighting and games over the centuries.
On 29 September 2018, during a medieval procession festival in Galway, Ireland, Carl Dornan Knight dressed in a dress and Donna Dornan dressed as a Celtic warrior walked into the large hall of Cleregal Castle.
"It's a great weekend coming up and it's something different", says Dennis Fitzgerald of County Kerry, "who prepared food for the contestants by frying vegetables at the Lard at the campfire as a weekend liquor owner".
"It's like going back to basics for me.
The theater worker, who was attending his first armoured combat festival, said, "I'm trying to do everything right".
In the field, soldiers dressed and fought in authentic chain-mail armor from nails to heads, while their swords were sharpened, some fell on helmets and some were cut off.
Others on the horse's back showed their skills by cutting the cabbage and the aubergine while walking.
Nearby, metal smelters made weapons, spice merchants made herbs, and merchants women made wool.
Some people dressed in serious and elegant costumes ventured into the character.
"In my opinion, anyone can dress up but being in character is an art form", said Helena Stackpole, who uses her fashion design background as "Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald" in a unique way.
"All the costumes are sewn by hand.
I have a belt that I have been embroidering on and it has taken me two years so far and the dress I am working on now has 800 pearls in the sleeve alone, which is hand sewn.
I'm a little serious about this", she said.
Death toll from Indonesian earthquake tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, was 832 on Sunday, the National Disaster Prevention Agency said, which was estimated to be higher than initially expected.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference that the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings and tsunami waves were as high as six meters (20 feet).
FBI court nominee contacts another defendant in Kavanaugh
FBI agents have contacted B's woman who has accused her of sexual abuse while investigating U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanow, her attorney said Saturday.
An announcement by Deborah Ramirez's lawyer, John Clown, said Cavanow's FBI investigation will look at various allegations of rape by Christine Blacey Ford against a conservative Federal Appeals Court judge at the dramatic Senate hearing this week.
Ramirez has alleged that Kavanaugh had uncovered his penis at a drunken party in the Yale University community bedroom when he was an undergraduate.
U.S. President Donald Trump leaned against pressure from the Central Senate Republicans and ordered an FBI investigation after a Senate hearing on Thursday, in which Ford, president of the University of California, details his claims that Kevannow attempted to rape her at a party in 1982 while both were still teenagers attending high school.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had blocked an FBI investigation by limiting its parameters.
Trump tweeted that he rejected the story, saying, "Really, I want them to interview anyone at their discretion who thinks it's appropriate".
White House spokesman Raj Shah said the Senate has set a "scale and duration" for the FBI investigation, which is expected to be completed in a week.
"The White House allows FBI agents to do what they're trained to do", Shah said.
The UK will not abandon environmental or animal standards after Brexit
The United Kingdom will not abandon the protection of its high environmental or animal protection standards to win post-Brexit trade deals, Environment Minister Michael Gowe said on Sunday.
The UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove arrives at Downing Street in London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking on the sidelines of the annual Conservative Party Conference, Gow said the UK has the advantage of being known for quality food products and this year the government will announce food strategies.
Europe regained the Ryder Cup with impressive singles performance
Francesco Molinari was honorably decorated as Europe came back in a dominant style in the Ryder Cup on Sunday, beating Italian Phil Michelson after taking the points needed to reach Magic Talley 14.5.
Michaelson took the hole after firing his tee shot into the water with a molinari on a green, making Italy the first European to win all five matches in a week, not one of the previous six.
As Italians, Henrik Stansson and Sergio Garcia effectively secured a victory already when they were in their sleep and secured at least half the points from their game - with Europe needing one at that point.
They needed to secure four and a half points out of 12 available points to win the trophy back and retain their place on home soil from the 1993 season.
The one-day team had only won the singles by dropping from four to win only twice - in 1999 by the U.S. in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012 by "Miracle of Medina", but another spectacular comeback was never seen on cards.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau showed Jim Furyk's team a ray of hope with an early win, but then the whole European points began.
Thorbjørn Olsen defeated Jordan Spitth and fellow rookie John Rehman Tiger Woods - defeating the 14-time great champion four out of four.
Ian Polter, "Mr. Ryder Cup", produced the almost most intense thrill of the week after the world number one Dustin Johnson accepted the 18th green which left Europe on the verge.
Then there was a question of which of the remaining matches on the course would be completed and that proved to be the Molinari - which shines the spectacular scenes of celebration by the largest galleries in the history of the event.
The neo-Nazi name was used as a codeword when German police protected Erdogan during a visit to Berlin - RT World News
A pair of East German police officers used the name of a notorious extremist neo-Nazi to work during the operation to protect Turkish President Erdogan, who was visiting Berlin this week, local media reported.
Two members of the Criminal Police Elite Counter-Terrorism Unit SEK in the East German state of Saxony are being questioned, the regional Interior Ministry said.
The men were held to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his expected trip to Germany.
Since officers were working undercover, the protocol required them to use a code name.
His choice was Uwe Bohnhardt, a notorious member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) - a neo-Nazi extremist group that murdered eight Turkish immigrants, a Greek citizen and a German police officer in the 2000s.
A strange code name emerged when the two signed up to access internal documents issued in local media reports.
In-charge officers of the operation responded quickly, and police officers were called immediately.
The head of the Saxony's criminal police, Patrick Klein, was the first to react to the news.
He said that Bohnhardt's use of the name was "unfortunately foolish" and represented "[his] shameless disregard for victims and their relatives".
Saxony's interior minister Roland Waller echoed these words as "horrible, terrible and utterly unacceptable".
Erdogan's visit to Berlin on Friday has sparked considerable controversy in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticized for hosting a leader accused of being more authoritarian.
Merkel said the visit is very important "because a personal meeting is essential to resolve when there are gaps".
The NSU first came to light in 2011 when the bodies of Bohnhardt and his colleague Uwe Mandalos were found inside a burned-out motorhome in East Germany.
Both are believed to have died in an apparent murder-suicide after a failed bank robbery in the city of Issein.
The third and last surviving member of the neo-Nazi group, Beat Zespany, was arrested shortly afterwards.
In July of this year, a German court sentenced her to prison for 10 murders.
She denied any involvement in the murders, although her lawyer said she believed she was morally guilty of failing to stop the murder.
The scandal surrounding the NSU has drawn widespread criticism from German security agencies.
Lawyers, activists, and relatives of the victims believe that many more cooperated with the group.
It also turned out that Germany's local intelligence agency BfV had placed numerous informants in the NSU and systematically systematically made the murder investigation, attempted murder, and group-related looting unsuccessful and impossible.
Tesla resigns as chairman and pays $20 million in fines for settling with the SEC
Elon Musk has settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued for his fraud over tweets privatizing Tesla.
Musk will have to resign as chairman, but will retain the position of CEO.
According to the settlement filing, Musk has 45 days to step down as chairman of Tesla's board of directors, and is banned from holding office for three years.
He will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
And because the whole thing started on a tweet, either recklessly or intentionally misled, Musk would have to get prior approval to say or post anything about Tesla, "in any form, including posts on social media, but not limited to, e.g., Twitter), the company's website (e.g., company blog), press releases and investor calls".
Tesla will have to pay an additional $20 million to settle claims that failed to cure Musk's initial tweet.
The SEC complaint confused investors with Musk's August 7 tweet saying he had privatized Tesla and raised funds to take it at $420 per share, which increased the company's share by more than 10 percent.
Musk immediately denied his claim, saying he would keep Tesla private and exposing investor anger.
The SEC objected to Musk's opening words that "they were false and misleading because there was no basis for fact".
Musk himself claims it was an honest mistake, writing in a blog post that he was under the impression that he secured the money in a meeting with a representative of the Saudi Arabian Supreme Wealth Fund.
Musk and the SEC were found to be close to a lower-sentence settlement, which banned Musk from being chairman for two years and he would not have had to admit to any wrongdoing, but Musk withdrew his endorsement Thursday.
Then on Friday, Tesla's stock fell, apparently changing his mind again and accepting tough conditions.
However, like the old deal, the Musk does not need to admit the guilt of investors misleading the new one.
The head of Alexandria vows to support the standard Ukrainian Church, which calls for Orthodox unity
The head of Alexandria, Theodore II, has shown support for the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is part of Moscow.
It comes with a conflict between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Theodore arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa on the second Thursday, meeting high church representatives and Orthodox faithful.
The head of Alexandria is one of the most revered footsteps of Orthodoxy, second only to the Ecumenical Headquarters of Constantinople.
"I have come here to tell you: Be with the Orthodox faith and with the canonical church", Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.
After visiting Odessa, he met with the head of the Metropolitan Service of the Polish Orthodox Church, who also supported the Canonical Ukrainian Church.
Both were also asked not to dispute the Ukrainian Church to stop it from providing autocephaly.
Theodore II promised that "we will always be with those who love Orthodox unity".
The Orthodox Church has recently faced a major crisis following the Constantinople Patriarchate's recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter is a constituent part of the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople has decided to send his exarch to Kiev, effectively violating the rule in which an Orthodox church is forbidden to interfere in the internal affairs of another church.
The Exarch is a special representative of the head, who holds a technically higher position in the hierarchy of the church than the Metropolitan Onfray, the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to the action of Constantinople, suspending the joint operation of church services and membership in each structure, led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
However, the decision was called a "warning" against further adverse measures for Constantinople and does not put a complete break on inter-church relations.
Ukraine hosts three Orthodox churches, yet only one of them - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate - is recognized by other churches.
Most Ukrainian priests recognize its authority, but the government is openly suing one of the controversial churches - the so-called Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.
The religious movement has its own self-proclaimed "Patriarch" Philaret, who wants to be completely independent and "equal" to the Moscow Patriarch, to gain the official status of the Orthodox Church.
Damascus reopens the main Syria-Jordan trade crossing for the first time in 3 years
The Syrian government has said it will reopen its main border crossing with neighboring Jordan, which was closed during the three years of hostilities in the area, state news agency SANA reported.
The Syrian crossing on the side of Dara opened up the Syrian journey to eliminate militants in the surrounding land.
Nassib is a major point of connection for trade routes between neighbouring countries, which also come between Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
The main points of Lavrov's UN speech
At the UN, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov lashed out at West's "political blackmail and animal force", saying that diplomacy should not give way to dictatorships and one-sided sanctions.
Foreign Minister Lavrov told the UN General Assembly on Friday that there was no regret in trying to maintain "self-declared status as global leaders" by pushing some Western powers against others.
He did not name the countries, but said they "used political blackmail, economic pressure and passive force".
The world will have to pay a high price for these selfish ambitions by a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who was Russia's ambassador to the UN for a decade, told the meeting that the culture of politics and negotiations had been replaced by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions without UN approval.
Such restrictions that extend to dozens of countries "are either illegal or ineffective", the minister said, citing the decades-old U.S. blockade of Cuba.
"But history teaches us nothing", Lavrov said, adding that accusations based on the infamous "extremely likely" thing are enough to blame anyone by some Western counterparts".
We recall that these unfair claims were used to support intervention and incite wars, such as the 1999 bombings of Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya.
The list of Western-led invasions was apparently not extensive, as Lavrov cites the seven-year Syrian war as one of the recent examples.
A failed attempt to overthrow the regime in Damascus - one that was carried out in conjunction with extremists - could have brought down the entire country and given way to a "terrorist caliphate".
Lavrov praised the Astan peace process jointly launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran, which helped prevent the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and other groups from claiming Syria.
Reconstruction of war-induced sites and helping refugees to return safely to their homes is now a top priority in the country.
Returning to the great power contest, Lavrov said the UN was actually built on facts "learned from World War II".
The Russian Foreign Minister noted that 2018 marks 80 years of the "shameful" 1938 Munich Agreement, in which France and Britain agreed to approve the Nazi annexation of the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia at the risk of pleasing Hitler.
Although British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain claimed that the Munich Agreement meant "peace for our time", the war began a year after.
Lavrov said the "Munich betrayal" shows us how far "national pride and disregard for international law" can go.
"The dictatorship and coercion of the colonial era must be overcome by the unbridled or thrown into the trash can of history".
According to Levrov, Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can address any challenges that arise in global issues.
"If you have any questions or claims to someone, sit down and talk, show the facts, listen to your opponent's arguments, try to balance your interests".
Dust in the eye?
What we know about Israel's vague "news" is as the BBC points out to Iran - RT World News
During his speech to the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the Israeli Prime Minister insisted that Tehran possesses secret nuclear sites.
As Israel plays the blame game, let's see if they have their own radioactive skeleton in the pyjamas.
With his featured "presentations", Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought his new revelation on Thursday, featuring aerial photographs of Iranian sites containing alleged nuclear-related material.
It didn't take Sammo much time to respond to Tehran, saying that Tel Aviv would be better off paying attention to its own "unpublished nuclear weapons program".
While Israel has never admitted - in particular, has not even denied - to possessing military nuclear weapons, RT's Murad Gazdev wonders if Tel Aviv is really the right country to point its fingers at others.
Scottish Government: No complaints against Alex Salmon before January
The Scottish Government has said that no complaints have been made regarding Alex Salmon before January this year.
Two sexual harassment allegations were made against the former Prime Minister in January, which firmly denies the claim.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Resigning from the SNP, Mr. Salmond is taking court action against the Scottish Government to process the complaint against him.
The Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been filed before January claiming that those complaints were first investigated in 2013.
A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government received two complaints in January regarding Alex Salmon.
This could not be ignored or ignored under the carpet.
No complaints were raised about the then Prime Minister Alex Salmon under the previous process and as we have said, the former Prime Minister was aware of the fact of the first investigation that was from Alex Salmon in April 2018.
We are confident that our processes are legally perfect and we will vigorously defend our position.
In due course, the Scottish Government will want to make as much information available as possible.
However, as we have said before, for legal reasons, we cannot comment further on the matter concerning Mr. Salmon at this time".
A spokesman for Alex Salmon said: "We have no comment to make as our petition for judicial review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session and we expect it to be summoned soon.
We will discuss our case in court.
Our aim is to establish that the Scottish Government complaint process used against Alex is illegal".
Glasgow 29-13 Dragons: Lee Jones is on a double for the Warriors
Glasgow returned to the road to victory in the Guinness Pro14 with a bonus-point win over the Dragons at Scotstone, as coach Dave Rainey expressed satisfaction but felt his side could have been more clinical.
After a surprise defeat by Port Elizabeth's Southern Kings last Saturday, Rennie ordered a team with many changes to respond, and while the maximum points were properly earned to stay on top in Conference A, it was far from effective that a turbulent wind and rain event played a part in the movement.
"I thought our defense was excellent tonight, we played on the right end of the field and our set-piece was great too", said Rennie.
"We should have done a little more clinical, there were more opportunities to take.
It was a trial condition.
We have created many opportunities that we are happy about.
We want to be more clinical but saying that if we had put 40 or 50 points on the board tonight it wouldn't have been good for us.
We had to work on it.
A win by bonus points but we need to do better next week at home on Zebra and against Saracens in Europe".
In a windy position, Glasgow initially seemed to be scoring but the TMO took a slight knock-on from Hugh Jones, as he collected Nico Matavala's inner pass and moved to the left corner.
The frustration didn't last long as the fourth-minute loosehead prop rushed through the middle of the Oley cable and Adam Hastings pinged for a smooth conversion.
Dragne narrowed the lead with an airwell robson penalty and knocked out the stand-off after a 20-minute mark to bring welsh within a point.
The Glasgow Forwards established a continuous siege of the Dragons Line before South African referee Stuart Berry gave a penalty in favour of Wales for an offseason tackle on home-stand-off Hastings in 22nd place and a fairly easy opening half was seen around the half-hour mark before.
The Warriors chose Scrum, but surrendered the hold before putting most of the liquid route together, the left wing Mataloa was unable to control the ball after some punch offense and missed the sweeping passing move out.
When Hastings overturned the Dragons line, the second try finally came two minutes after the interval and he then sent Lee Jones a cunning pass out, which gave him a boost.
Hastings showed his back against the post to make his conversion 12-6 at half-time.
Glasgow showed the best possible start in the first minute of the second-half, as Leo Jones easily struggled for his second attempt to add an extra to Alex Dunbar's splashy offload.
However, the Fly Hack was followed by the Dragons centre Adam Warren, who stood to score under the post, Josh Lewis, who had replaced Robson before the break, when he took over in midfield four minutes later.
The Warriors quickly regained dominance and the bonus-point came on the fourth attempt in the 54th minute as Hugh Jones slipped down from the right, and Hastings was shortened for the conversion - a third of his four attempts.
Glasgow remained in a comfortable suspension and a fifth attempt came in a few minutes as Dunbar sub-scrambled-half, George Horn was about to make a cruise over and completed the boot scoring of Hastings.
Cable was awarded Man of the Match but Rennie praised Hastings.
"Obviously they didn't want us to play and were flying in between", said Coach.
"It probably needed to be a few meters deep but it is very slippery and managed to find some space behind it.
He has a good combination of form and confidence in his nerves".
Morton 1 - 5 Air United: Five Star Air defeats the hosts
The Air Championship remains at the top of the table thanks to goals from doubles by Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore and Deacon McDade.
Michael Rose leads the Shankland Air to the lead as he moves toward the goal in the corner of the McDowell.
Morton tied the level by first trying on a 35-minute goal when Charlie Telfer took his trembling Robbie Crawford out of his own box and sent airkeeper Ross Dusan behind and into a far-away corner.
When Gary Oliver was pushed to Dukan, the Greenock side was given a great opportunity to take a four-minute lead in the second half, but Michael Tideser's penalty was badly hit and easily taken by the keeper.
The air moved for the second time in 74 minutes when substitute Craig McGuffey's cross was raised high in the air and when it fell to the ground, fellow replacement Craig Moore took him home to learn.
Within a minute Moore re-cut the ball for Shankland and the striker scored his 17th goal of the season.
As visitors ran, Moore dropped out of the edge of the box in fourth place and McGuide hit him home to complete the score.
Alloa 0 - 2 Falkirk: Barrens wins the first league win
Falkirk finally gave Ray McKinnon a "happy, relieved, happy" tribute after recording his much-needed first league victory and season points.
Rangers striker Zach Rudden's 18-year-old on loan doubled half-time on both sides to achieve the Barents level at the foot of the championship with host Alloa Athletic and took the club's burden on his shoulders.
"It was an important game for us", McKinnon admitted.
"In the last three matches, we were probably more excited, so it was great to come here and pick up three points in a pressure situation.
I'm really happy to get the first points on the board.
It would not have been defined, but it was important that we won".
In the 26th minute Raddy Patrick entered the Browse Cross and then Diamantas Petravcius entered the middle of the goal line from the second half after lifting the lobed shot above the keeper Neil Perry.
Vesp's manager, Jim Goodwin, admitted, "We hope to make this place a fortress but it hasn't happened yet".
More than 11,000 petitions from Hearts fans against the semi-final draw
The Hartz fan's petition against the schedule of the Betfred Cup semi-finals has attracted more than 11,000 signatures.
Anger continues over the decision to play both semi-finals on the same day in the same stadium.
The SPFL was set to schedule a Rangers tie against Aberdeen at 12pm and Celtic against Hearts at 7.45pm, with the advice of Police Scotland, as a riot erupted between fans of both the Jambos and Dons last week.
On Saturday The Evening News and Aberdeen Evening Express joined forces for a decent deal for fans.
The so-called "Super Sunday" decision was condemned by both Aberdeen and Hearts, with the clubs making their own statements criticizing the scheduling.
The application was launched on change.org on Thursday evening, asking one of the fixtures to move to another location or play on a different date.
Man accused of stabbing two women to death in Kent village
Two women, aged between 50 and 70, died at the scene.
According to a female spokeswoman, the man, who was in his 70s, is in a stable condition in hospital.
A 28-year-old, who lives on the street, is in custody and will face two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder as seen through a video link in the Medway Magistrates Court on Monday.
Police have not yet given the victims' names but they believe they and the suspect knew each other.
Neighbors said they were shocked by what happened in such a "quiet and friendly" village.
"We've been here for five years and we've never heard anything bad happen, this place has always been very peaceful and a beautiful place", said 31-year-old Sophie Murray-Brown to the Press Association.
King George III joins forces with the Royal Archives Hamilton to teach the world about
When the Queen launched a project to open up a vast collection of her documents from the reign of George III, she hoped that letters, diaries and speeches would give people much more insight into their reputation for madness.
Now, those papers are going to reach a fairly new audience, as the Royal Archives create an unlikely kind of connection with the hit West End musical.
The actor, playing the role of George III in Hamilton, is invited to the library at Windsor Castle to study key documents from the reign of the Queen's great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, as scholars hope to inspire others to learn more about the real king.
Those documents will now be made available digitally to fans of the fan show, as researchers work to deliver their "old handwritten pieces of paper" to a wider audience.
Despite Prince Harry's ancestors being sent on stage in full, members of the Royal Family have publicly approved the musical with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
Michael Gibson, playing a role in the West End, said he had much to think about after studying the papers, which shed light on the King, who is sealed in the public imagination in Hamilton, his portrait - The Madness of King George and the children's series Horrible History in the Imagination of the People.
"We fell in love" after "Beautiful Letters"
U.S. President Donald Trump announced at a rally with supporters that "we've fallen in love" after exchanging letters, citing his enthusiasm for Saturday's new heights of improved relations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim have said they want to work towards nuclear-freeing the Korean Peninsula, which is why they are holding an unprecedented meeting in Singapore earlier this year to discuss the idea.
Before turning the pages of decades of public hatred, leaders regularly exchanged threats and insults as North Korea moved forward to develop a nuclear missile capable of striking the United States.
"I was really tough - and that was it too.
And we're going back and forth", Mr. Trump said at a rally in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, okay?
No, really - he wrote me beautiful letters, and those are great letters", he said.
Juliet Lewis 'Rosen' joins the cast of spin-off 'The Corners'
A Million Little Pieces and camping star Juliet Lewis confirmed via Twitter that she has joined the role of Rosen Spinoff of the Conchords.
"Yes, this is happening.
The secret is out!! #JulietteLewisisontheconners #TheConners", the actress tweeted this week, with a photo with a script with the name of the sitcom embellished in her photo next to her.
Another post features a photo of Lewis with Johnny Galacci and Sarah Gilbert, who plays the role of David and Darlene's ex on the show.
"Imagine who's standing next to the #Ghicorners ??!!
I am reunited with my brother Griswold!
It's very exciting.
The text is very nice. #JulietteLewisisonTheConners", Lewis wrote.
Lewis and Galaxie played the brothers Audrey and Rusty Griswold in the 1989 film Christmas Vacation.
The Hollywood Reporter said that Lewis will play Galacki's girlfriend Blue, but it is unclear how many episodes she will appear in.
The Ghi Corners is scheduled to start in October.
When it returned later this spring, it received a high rating and was renewed for a second season, but the show was cancelled and producer-star Rosen Barr was fired in May after tweeting a racist joke about a former Obama executive.
Most of Rosen's original cast members - including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf, and John Goodman - will shine in the glee corners.
Showtime cancels it after two seasons of "I'm Dying Up Here".
"I'm Dying Up Here", a production by show-time playwright Jim Carrey, has been cancelled after two seasons.
Showtime has declined to order a third season of the drama I'm Dying Up Here, produced by Jim Carey.
Deadline.com said it held the low viewership responsible for the cable network's decision to cancel the show.
Melissa Leo, Erie Graner, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Sailer, Jack Lacy and Andrew Sentino, the series was set in Los Angeles' stand-up comedy scene from the 1970s.
Angarano tweeted on Friday, "I'm so grateful for the last three years. When people ask me about the show, I say "It's a complex show about complex people... but it's really fun to make".

Eve Green, Martin Scorsese will star in the BBC play 'The Luminaries'
Penny Dreadful will star in the six-part drama, The Luminaries, by actress Eva Green, actor Martin Scorsese from Badlands and Robin Hood from Elm Hewson in the BBC.
The series, based on Eleanor Ceton's Man Booker Prize-winning novel, is set to begin filming in November.
The story takes place during the 1860s gold rush in New Zealand.
Eleanor has written a series of brilliant screenplays.
"I love her original novel and it's so exciting that it reveals more excellent content than her own screen adaptation", Green said in a statement.
"I am very happy to bring this novel to the screen and feel extremely fortunate to work with such fantastic people in a variety of arts", added Keaton.
"Writing a novel is a lonely occupation, but writing for the screen is quite collaborative, and to expand and enrich the world of The Luminaries, which goes beyond the realm of my own imagination, is a humble and extremely enjoyable experience.
I can't be happier that the brilliant Claire McCarthy is sewing on, and I can't wait to bring this incredible cast to life".
A redshirt season is no longer possible after an Alabama injury.
The idea of an Alabama backup quarterback Jalen Sadek probably ended on Saturday to resume this season.
He made his fifth start of the season, including Hurts being included in Saturday's matchup in a match against Louisiana for the top-ranked Crimson Tide.
Under the new NCAA rules this season, a player can play in as many as four games and still qualify for the Redshirt season.
A report by Athletic earlier this month suggested that Hertz was planning to take that route because of the quarterback controversy and the frustration over how he was handled by his team's coaching staff.
Tuva Tagovalova supplied Hurts as a starter this season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said he planned to take advantage of Hurts' skill set.
Guided Alabama in the national championship game against Georgia last season were hurt, but he was moved to the second half by Tagovailova, who defeated the Crimson Tide 26-23.
Former SEC offensive Player of the Year, Hertz entered the season, having started the previous 28 games for Alabama, posting a 26-2 record.
Entering Saturday's contest, Hurts completed 22 of 31 passes for 276 yards, including four touchdowns and an interception in the Crimson Tide's first four games.
He also ran for 54 yards 15 times.
Owens: The idea of a DAZ signature needs to be worked on 'quickly'.
Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver D.J. Bryant predicts he will return to the NFL "soon".
Hall of Famer Terrell Owens said for Bryant, that time will not come soon.
Bryant tweeted a word on Friday, answering a question on Twitter when he planned to sign with the team: "Quickly".
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Bryant has been without since the Dallas Cowboys released him in a pay dispute in mid-April.
Bryant, who turned down a contract offer from the Baltimore Ravens and has been consistently associated with the Cleveland Browns, said earlier in the season that he was focusing on improving himself before signing with the team.
Owens, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August and is still announcing an NFL return, told TMZ that Bryant's focus should be back on the field - immediately.
"He goes to the team and proves to everyone that the way he does it he seems capable", Owens told the website.
"Because everyone, if you listen to all the critics, feels like they've missed a step, not the person they once were, or the person they feel like they are.
At this point in the game, go to the roster, no matter what the money is - then it's a one-year deal, a two-year deal, whatever it may be - and show everyone what you make, what you're capable of".
Bryant, the team's leading rusher, had 69 receptions for 838 yards and six touchdowns with Dallas in 2017.
The 29-year-old has gone to a career-long 23 regular-season games without a 100-yard performance.
After signing a five-year, $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant has failed to record a 1,000-yard season or have had more than eight touchdown receptions in a season.
Owens advised that "from the general manager or owner's point of view, when they think your skills are falling, you should not be holding a warrant or a pledge for the money you are really looking for".
Warning that if Bryant doesn't find his way onto the roster in the near future, "it won't happen again", Owens said the idea of a re-connection with the struggling Cowboys should follow.
Owens, who scored 38 touchdowns in three seasons with the Dells, said, "Certainly, I don't know if that relationship is broken".
"I'm thinking for the day, if the Cowboys welcome him back and give him a chance, it'll be a hoax for the day and the franchise".
