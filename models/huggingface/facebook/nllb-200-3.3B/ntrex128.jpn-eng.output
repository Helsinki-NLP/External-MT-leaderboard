The Welsh Assembly Member (AM) who fears being shamed
Some MPs are confused by the proposal to change the title of a Welsh Member of Parliament from AM (Assembly Member) to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The plan to change the name of the Welsh Assembly was the starting point.
Members of parliament from all parties are concerned that this will lead to a ridiculous situation.
A Labour MP said he was concerned that the party would be "setting itself up" for the "Twp" and "Pwp" campaigns.
For those of you who aren't Welsh, the Welsh word for "fuck" is "twp".
A member of the Proud Kamri party said that the entire party was "displeased" and proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative MP said that the party was "open" to the name change, but that there was little difference between the pronunciation of MWP and "muppet".
By the way, the Welsh "w" sounds like the English "u" in the Yorkshire accent.
The committee of deputies, which is drafting the name change, stated that "the final decision on the name of the members of the House of Assembly is, of course, a matter for the members themselves".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change the name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which revealed that there was a large backing for the name change of the parliament from Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the Members' call, the committee supported the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP) motion, but in the public consultation the MWP motion received the most support.
The MP is actually proposing an alternative, but the path to agreement could prove a headache for Speaker Erin Jones, who is required to submit a draft bill on the name change within weeks.
The reform bill would also include rules on the vote of no confidence in MPs and other reforms to the way Parliament operates, including the structure of the committee system.
In the process of considering the bill, the member will have the final say on what to call himself.
Macedonia held a referendum to change the name of the country.
A referendum on changing the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia will take place on Sunday.
The referendum was organized to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over the territory it claims as Macedonia.
Greece has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor deserves a claim to Greek territory, and has strongly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a cost to the country's membership of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silenced as the churches of Harlem struggle.
"When I talk to the elderly, they tell me that in the past, every picture had a bar and a church", says Adam.
"Now neither of them exists".
There's no reason why the bar should be gone.
"We're communicating in a different way", he says now.
"The bar is no longer the common neighborhood living room".
As for the church, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the powerful expect and that "sooner or later, we will have to start all over again".
He also said that the churches were replaced by apartments and flats, and that the people who lived there did not cooperate in maintaining the churches.
"I think most of the people in this building will be white", he says. "This will make the church closing faster, because most of the people who move in shouldn't be in the church".
The church was built by a white congregation. Harlem then became a black city. The Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation disappeared in the 1930s.
The black congregation that was praying nearby owned the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by the Congregation of the Black Faith under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of 125 retailers in Harlem's Mall and helped employ and support black people.
The church was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the parishioners of Father Johnson planned a rebuilding and commissioned the Carillon.
John Howard Johnson, the Reverend, and his successor, St. Martin, named the bell the poor man's bell.
Musicians who came to play the carillon in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an invaluable historical instrument".
According to Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, this was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysius D. Lind, who had come to the church on the river 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merryweather says that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complex story of builders, some of them brought in by the faithful leaders of the Church, others by the diocesan parishes.
In July, the governing body of the parish, the pastoral authority, sent a letter of concern to the parish that the parish was "trying to cover the cost". However, the governing body was not involved in hiring architects or contractors.
Some parishioners complained that the bishop's actions were opaque.
A 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark while diving in a lobster in California.
On Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while swimming in a California lobster pond.
It happened just before 7:00 a.m. at Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
KSWB-TV reports that Chad Hamel was swimming in the ocean with a friend for an hour and a half on a Saturday morning in San Diego when he heard a boy cry for help and went to pick him up.
Hamel, who at first thought he was just too excited to take the lobster, soon "realized it was a scream". "It was bitten!"
I got a bite!
His whole collarbone is torn. Hamel noticed when he rescued the boy.
"I told them to get out of the sea, because there are sharks!" says Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Lady and Children's Hospital in San Diego in a dangerous condition.
We don't know what kind of shark it was.
Life-guard captain Larry Giles said that the shark had been confirmed as present for weeks but had not been identified as a dangerous species.
In addition, the boy's upper torso is left with a very serious contusion.
For investigation and security, authorities have placed a 48-hour blockade from the beach of Ponto to the beach of Swami in Esenitas.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to make a big splash in the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's employed Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams as departmental style beauty aisles for the specialists.
As part of a major push to the £2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow while fashion and home goods sales are falling, a larger beauty aisle has been tested at 11 beauty shops across the country, and if successful, will be expanded next year.
The investment in beauty came as supermarkets sought to use all the space on their shelves when they were being sued by television, electronics, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's announced that it will double its number of beauty products to 3,000, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Existing products like L'Oreal, Maybelline, Burt's Bees, etc. will also be able to take up more space with brands like the ones you see in Boots.
The store has renewed its boutique zone to accommodate the needs of young people, and has made most of its products vegan.
In addition, the fragrance company, Flagrance Shop, is to be sold to two Sainsbury's stores, one opening in Croydon, South London, last week, and the other in Cely Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend to buy small amounts of food at local convenience stores on a daily basis have forced supermarkets to do a lot of work to attract customers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, as supermarket chains offer more service and less food to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl, stores will become more and more department stores.
Sainsbury's has expanded its presence by adding Argos stores to hundreds of stores since it bought two chains two years ago, which increased its grocery sales and increased the profitability of its acquisitions.
The previous attempt to refurbish the beauty shop and pharmacy failed.
Sainsbury, who had a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, broke up over how to distribute the drugstore profits.
A new plan emerged after Sainsbury sold its 281 stores three years ago to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Lloyds also became involved in the campaign, and four stores were opened with La Roche-Posay and Vichy, among other skincare brands.
Sainsbury's commercial director Paul Mill Hicks says, "By changing the look and feel of the beauty aisle, we change the environment of the customer.
And we invest in our specially trained colleagues who can give us advice.
Our brands are designed to meet all needs, to bring new beauty to old businesses in an attractive environment and convenient location.
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal.
The Dragon's Den star, Peter Jones, was "outraged" by her withdrawal from an £11 million deal for Peter's lifestyle brand business, which focused on a new deal with Marks and Spencer by Holly Willoughby and ITV.
Willoughby is unable to spend time on the home furnishings and accessories brand Truly.
Their business was likened to the Gwyneth Paltrow Group brand.
This morning, Willowbee posted on Instagram that they're out of business.
Holly Willoughby has walked out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute, leaving Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, to focus on a new big contract with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
On Thursday, the Golden Girls revealed that her new contract worth £1.5 million meant she would be unable to spend time with home goods and accessories brand Truly, during a tense meeting at their headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, Jones was reportedly "outraged", sources said.
The business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Group brand, and doubled Willowby's estimated $11 million in assets.
When Willowby posted on Instagram that he was retiring from Truly, Jones jumped out of England and headed for one of the villas.
The source said, "Truly is Holly's top priority right now.
It's going to be a long-term project that we've been looking at for decades.
Everyone was shocked by the decision to withdraw.
No one can believe what happened on Thursday, it was just after the launch.
Marlow has warehouses full of goods ready for sale".
Experts say the departure of Britain's most trusted star, Willoughby, will cost millions of pounds in the form of massive investments and potential delays in products ranging from cushions to candles, clothing and home goods.
This means the end of a long friendship.
Willowby and her husband Dan Baldwin, the mother of three, had been in a relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby launched Cap and Truly in 2016, with Jones joining as president in March.
The two are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willowby is to replace Ant McPartlin as the face of M&S and become ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that he would not comment on his business dealings.
I had a difficult conversation and I said, "I'm in love".
He joked that his comments were "not public" and that the media was too optimistic about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up?
The president said it in a "news anchor" kind of voice.
"I'm not giving up anything".
The president said that after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which was hailed by the president as a major step forward towards North Korea's denuclearisation, Kim Jong-un was positive about the second meeting.
But the denuclearization talks have reached a dead end.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Lee Jeong-hyun, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the United States had not yet "correspondingly" responded to the country's early arms reduction.
Instead, he said, the US continues to use sanctions to put pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're doing well with North Korea".
"I used to be going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now we have a great relationship".
Trump says that efforts to improve relations with North Korea have led to desirable results, such as the end of missile testing, the release of innocent hostages, and the conversion of the bodies of American soldiers.
And, he used a strange metaphor when talking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of calling out 10,000 people to fill a packed auditorium, you called out 200 people in there right now", Trump said, pointing directly at the people in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia killed hundreds.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok Island, no national disaster has been declared that would require international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, we have made it clear that we do not ask for international assistance, which is a serious matter", says Sumbon.
Save the Children is preparing to move to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to operate in the area.
Spoto, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities are considering whether to allow international agencies to assist in the situation in Pal.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly experiencing, the country is desperately unprepared to face the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but not so much on the other coastlines.
Pal clearly has fewer tsunami sirens, but with one, it could save more lives.
It's very risky to go to an Indonesian island even at the best of times.
Natural disasters have made logistics even more complicated.
The rescue ship, which had been docked at Lombo to pick up earthquake patients, sailed to Pal, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure a central issue of his campaign, and has invested in roads and railways.
But, with no re-election next year, the lack of funds has plagued Joko's administration.
President Joko is under pressure from the long-running sectarian tension in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are of more conservative beliefs.
More than a thousand people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. Christian and Muslim gangs are fighting with machetes, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons.
I recommend Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool, who is a great addition to the team.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute of Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal when he caught a pass from Sheldon Shakir, and his team was 1-0 down.
He taps the ball to the left end and shoots into the forward post.
The ball went far above the goal and landed in the top right-hand net.
The ball was scored by a jumped Cepa Alizabalaga.
"Players like Shaq are just trying to get ahead as quickly as possible, and I was just trying to get my position to catch the ball and play my game in the time that I had", Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, so I touched him a little, didn't think too much, I just shot him".
Chelsea, who took a point from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute, were leading 1-0 at halftime.
The Blues striker blocked a pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, circled the midfield and raced towards Liverpool.
Kovacic was a quick give-and-go in midfield.
And then, I let go of the beautiful slippass and headed for the goal.
He broke through the defence and made it to the net, and with his left foot he made a cross-cut to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
On Wednesday, Liverpool played Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play video games against Valtteri Bottas in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Agency spokesman Soto Purowo Nugroho reported that many people were trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings following Friday's 7.5 magnitude quake, which caused waves as high as 20 feet.
In Pal, a city of 380,000, the ruins of collapsed buildings are scattered.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder of a woman.
A woman's body was found this morning in Bilkenhead, Merseyside, and a criminal investigation has been launched.
A 44-year-old man was found stabbed in the Grayson Moose on John Street at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police are calling for information from the community.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in early stages, but we are calling for information from the people at Birkenhead on Merseyside.
"We're listening to taxi drivers, especially because they might be recording something important to the investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in the Birkenhead area and that she had died in her home.
In the afternoon, a friend of the woman's arrived at the scene to be questioned about the location of the woman's body this morning.
Police are calling the victim's neighborhood, and an investigation is underway.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose tried to return to his building, but was told by the police that he could not get in or out of the building.
When he realized what had happened, he said nothing.
Now, the residents are told that they will be allowed to enter the building in a few hours.
I heard the police say this whole city is being treated as a murder scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
And he kept saying, "That's terrible".
At 2 p.m., two patrol cars were inside the rope, the other was just outside.
A few policemen were inside the rope, watching the building blocks.
If you have information, please contact DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or 0800 555 111 or call Crimestoppers anonymously and tell them the log 247 of September 30th.
The Cromwell statue in the Capitol is the latest monument to face the "write-off of history".
His expulsion was poetic justice, as many of the cultural and religious artifacts of Britain, like the Taliban, were destroyed by fanatical Puritans.
Mr. Crick called the Cromwell Society "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The subject of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was inevitable in the current debate on its removal.
The symbol of the English Civil War was not the one Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps a different Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of our ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's epic depiction of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century's thinking and a part of the record of a man many still believe worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell, in the late 19th century, was more of a defender of Parliament against outside pressure than he is today, and in his case, of course, the monarchy.
It is the subject of an ongoing historical controversy as to whether it is the perfectly correct description.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the country's subsequent development, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His deeds as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance".
A killer pig mole kills a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China.
A man known only by the name "Yuan" was found with an artery cut in a market in the province of Guangzhou and blood stained around a pigsty, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in the pig farm of Xining City, Qinghai Province, China, was vaccinating pigs.
He said he was traveling with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at a market in neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door of the adjacent pigsty open.
Inside the hut there was a large male pig with a mouth full of blood.
The report said that forensic tests confirmed that the 550-pound pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bare", said a cousin called "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera caught a scene of Yuan entering the market to feed the pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
The body was found an hour after death.
The pig that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
Market managers told the Evening News that the pigs were quarantined to make sure no one was harmed and that the police were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and the market manager are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been instances of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in a truck, and his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by a pig in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not normally aggressive, the taste of blood can be a "trigger".
"I'm just playing.
I'm a child, I'm curious, and I'm not going to hunt.
"We just have to be honest and honest", he says.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes through the cold waters north of the Gulf of Mexico.
But, Rosa, for the next few days, the torrential rains will continue to sweep across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa's winds were a Category 1 hurricane at 85 miles per hour as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, new trout are emerging in the Pacific and moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. As the rose approaches Baja California on Monday as a tropical depression, it will push the tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, Rosa brought 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
And, with tropical humidity and approaching thunderstorms, there will be extensive rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
In the countryside, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause flooding, landslides, landslides, and other hazards.
Tropical wetlands, especially in parts of Arizona and southern Nevada, can increase precipitation by two to three inches per hour.
And in the southwest, particularly in Arizona, we're seeing two to four inches of rain.
The scattered nature of tropical rains can cause flooding and rapid deterioration of the situation.
Therefore, it is very dangerous to go on foot in the desert in the rain.
There is a danger that the gorge will become a river due to heavy rains, thunder and strong winds in some places, and hailstorms.
The approaching trout is causing localized heavy rainfall along parts of Southern California's coastline.
Over 0.5 inches of rainfall may occur, which may cause minor landslides and road slip.
This is the first rain of the monsoon season in this region.
A sudden tropical downpour is approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and is expected to spread to the rest of the state on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to spread over a wide area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, temperatures fluctuate sharply across the United States to bring down the Arctic temperatures, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
It can cause dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a good example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on Sundays.
Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, Iowa and Des Moines have temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees.
The heat of the summer will increase again in the coming days.
As the southern plains spread to the northeast, 80 degrees, much of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm in October.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that the eastern United States will often experience above-average temperatures in early October.
Over 20 million people are going to see Brett Kavanaugh's audition.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court, and the testimony of Blaze Ford, who claims to have been sexually assaulted in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, on Friday night, the station suspended its regular programming in the wake of a twisted agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had engineered to conduct a week-long investigation of the FBI, and political support continued.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had drunk and molested her and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Cavanaugh testified passionately that it would never happen.
Friday, according to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched it.
At this point, the company's ratings were the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers for other companies, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Nielsen always has a problem with the crowd at the office.
That's roughly the same as the number of people who watch a football game or watch the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, which has a host whose opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh's nomination, averaged 5.69 million viewers in its first day of auditions, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million.
After the hearing, it was still a topic.
Freak was the lead in Friday.
A moderate Republican who had made a statement that he would support and vote for Kavanaugh was surrounded by CNN and CBS reporters and shouted by protesters as he tried to board the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing Friday morning.
He stood there with his eyes closed while he was being vilified on CNN live.
"I am standing before you", said one woman.
"Does he seem to be telling the truth?"
He was also told, "You have power because women are powerless".
According to Flek, his office issued a statement saying that he should have spoken to the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
A few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee votes on Kavanaugh's nomination by a vote of all Senators, all stations will begin broadcasting live.
But Freck said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidates next week, as a minority of Democrats claim.
Flake was pretty sure it was a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans could not vote to appoint Kavanaugh.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the claims against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has been criticized for "political maneuvering" over Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May denounced criticism that her plan to leave the EU would "enjoy political games" at the expense of Britain's future.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, who is on the front page of the paper, highlighted his attack on the so-called Checker plan, saying that it was "absolutely wonderful" that the UK and EU collected taxes on each other.
The police have arrested a suspect, Dayton Simpson, in connection with the death of a LSU player who was beaten by Wade Sims.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Simms.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and booked for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video showing Simms and Simpson fighting, and police noted that Simms had lost his glasses on the way.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was found in them, CBS series WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wade.
The consolation prize was reported to be $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office on Friday issued a preliminary report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is grateful for the cooperation of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens in making the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Areva thanked the local law enforcement agency for its "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He's 6'6" and grew up in Baton Rouge. His father, Wayne, played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"What I feared has come to pass", says Wade.
A volcano erupts ash in Mexico City.
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern side of Mexico City.
The National Fire Prevention Center warned people to evacuate the volcano on Saturday, recording 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours from the volcano that began activity in the crater.
The center was monitoring the shaking and the tremors.
The images from SNS show ash covering the windshield of a car in the Sochimilco neighborhood of Mexico City.
Geologists had observed an increase in volcanic activity in the area 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The independence day was postponed, the Catalan separatists clashed with the police.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with police, and thousands of people took part in a demonstration marking the anniversary of the Catalan vote to leave the party.
When a group of masked pro-separatists were pushed by the riot police, they threw eggs and powder paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on a street that was always crowded with tourists.
The Scaffolds also used their guards to act with the police during the day to end the fighting.
For several hours, a group of pro-independence protesters cried "We will not forget, we will not forgive", and the coalition forces cried "For Spain, forever".
According to local newspapers, 14 people have been treated for minor injuries from the protests.
Tensions are rising in the region, a year after the October 1st referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority voted for independence, but the opposition boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, in areas where violent clashes were taking place last year, police tried to prevent the elections from taking place, where about 1,000 people were injured.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to prevent a demonstration backed by the state police.
The movement progressed, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Thermès, 68, an electrician who is involved in separatist activities with his wife, says there is no hope for Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year was a great opportunity.
"I saw my parents crying because they were happy to vote, but now they are stuck", he said.
Despite a narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence party is struggling to gain momentum this year, in the run-up to the trials over their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent drafting of the declaration of independence, for their voluntary exile and for their detained brilliant leaders.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Pugh, who was recording a protest by phone for the police, said the conflict was being exacerbated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting closer", he says.
Oriol Funcellas, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced on Sunday that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Running for European elections is the best way to denounce the contempt and repression of our democracy by the Spanish government", he says.
The men who were arrested after the London van hit their house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a series of clashes at their home in Bury, London.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 19:30 BST in Ballinagar Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the building itself.
There are signs of a crossbow being fired from the car.
The strike of the manga, Livingston's win over the Rangers 1-0.
The first goal by Dori Menga ensured the victory of Livingston.
Ranger was shocked when Livingston gave the club's manager, Steven Gerrard, his second defeat in 18 games.
Gary Holt's side matched the second Hibernian, so Dory Menga's attack proved to be a draw.
Gerrard's side are without a win away from the Premiership this season and face eight points trailing Leeds Herds next Sunday.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Win in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, will extend their undefeated streak in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still on the losing side since trading Kenny Myler last week.
Livingston missed his chance with the dull visitor.
Holt's team was supposed to have been ahead long before the score was scored. His directness caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort towards the goal. Then Alan Lithgow could only direct the wide effort after such a slide to meet Craig Halkett's heading across the goal.
The hosts were happy to see the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how the important goal was achieved.
Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston opened the game with a combination of Decrangle Gallagher and Robinson.
By this stage, the Rangers had taken over the property, could not break through the home defense, and the goalie Liam Kelly was barely disturbed.
Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly, but the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman was denied the call after Rangers goalkeeper Alan McCleary and Lissego's feet were seen wide-flashing from another Livingston set play.
The cross was cleared in the Livingston box, but Halkett was substituted by Glenn Middleton, and one of the two penalty claims for the handball was dismissed.
The phenomenon of Livingstone, analyzed by
The film is a comedy about a young man who is a doctor.
Livingston's amazing performance and results.
For men, they were brilliant, and they were consistently exceeding expectations for this upward trajectory.
Their playing style and personnel have changed little since returning to the top flight, but the great credit for the way he has powered the team since his arrival has to go to Holt.
He had many heroes.
With Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at the ready, Captain Halkett had put together a brilliantly organized defense.
The ranger, however, was lacking in inspiration.
And they were as good as they were sometimes under Gerrard, and they didn't quite meet those standards.
Their final ball was missing - they've only opened the home side once - and that's a wake-up call for the Rangers.
Erdoğan, Cologne, will have a mixed reception.
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders gathered for breakfast in Berlin, with smiles and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's membership in the EU.
Erdoğan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
It has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a strong crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were found nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also heard their voices and condemned the policies of Prime Minister Erdogan and the German government's decision to welcome him to their country.
The protests of the fight reflect the discord between the visitors, who are welcomed by some German-Turkish as heroes, and the visitors, who are criticized by others as dictators.
Deptford Road collision: A cyclist killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred at 10:15 am UK time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics rushed to the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred a month after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childs Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and report him to relatives.
The road is closed and buses are being diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Six guards were injured in a riot at Long Larten Prison.
Six guards were injured in the riot at the maximum-security men's prison, the guard said.
A riot has broken out in HMP Longleatine, Worcestershire, on Sunday at around 09:30 British time.
Special Tornado guards were called in to deal with the unrest in the wing, where eight inmates were held.
The officer suffered minor facial injuries and was treated at the scene.
A prison representative said: "Special trained guards have been deployed to deal with the events taking place at HMP Long Glartein.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in prisons, and those responsible will be named by the police and spend longer in prison".
HMP Long Latitude houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was attacked by a prisoner and was treated in hospital.
And last October, a task force was called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa's cannon water is putting Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City at risk.
While tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, there is a high risk of a typhoon early next week as the residual energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the southwestern desert.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, to southern Nevada, and eastern and southeastern California and Utah.
Rosa is forecast to approach late Monday with rain and make a direct hit on Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service tweeted: "Only 10 tropical storms or tropical depressions have been within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ threshold.
The latest National Hurricane Center models are predicting rainfall of 2 to 4 inches and unprecedented rainfall of up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, may be 1 to 2 inches, and rarer ones up to 4 inches.
The region is suffering from drought, so for those who are not at risk of the water from the cannon, the rain of roses may be a blessing.
Flooding is a very serious problem, but with the Southwest currently in a state of drought, some rainfall could be beneficial.
According to the U.S. more than 40 percent of Arizona is in at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category", reported the drought monitor of weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will cross the Baja California peninsula in Mexico to the land.
Hurricane Rosa had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, was located 385 mph south of Punta Yucatan, Mexico, and was moving north at 12 mph.
The storm has hit the cold waters of the Pacific, and that's why it's so weak.
As a result, a tropical depression is forecast to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or night.
There is a risk of heavy rainfall and flooding in Mexico.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain, with a maximum of 10 inches, is expected in northwestern Sonora from Baja California", weather.com reported.
Rosa will cross Mexico northward as a tropical storm before approaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, and will pass through Arizona again by late Tuesday night and continue southward into Utah.
"The main hazards that Rosa and its effects will pose are the extremely high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to cause life-threatening hailstorms, sandstorms in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack. Four people arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured on a Excelsior terrace in Mid-Summer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He's been taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon, Somerset Police said.
The police are waiting for someone to come forward with a cell phone video of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffers from the indignity and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the rejection of the Democratic Party's cruel and heinous measures", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Cabanero suffers from the "dumbness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cabanuev testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally refuting her claims that she had sexually assaulted Christine Bladeford decades ago when they were teenagers.
Fide also testified at the trial to her claims.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the greatness, the character, and the courage of Cabanova that day".
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a legal professional with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president, speaking of the importance of Republican candidates in the midterm elections, mentioned Cabanero's nomination in a distant way.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't run, but I run around".
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates".
Trump said that Democrats have a mission to "resist, resist, resist".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate chamber on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place by Friday, the GOP chief executive's aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and casualties are rising.
A massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing at least 384 people and displacing many as a wave swept onto the beach, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on Friday at Death Beach, and by dusk, waves of up to 6 meters (18 feet) had washed ashore, many drowned and died, and the entire trail was destroyed.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were doing activities on the beach and they were killed because they didn't run away immediately", said Sopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in a brief statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami came in unison, dragging cars, trees, houses and hitting everything on the land", said Nguloho, adding that the tsunami had reached the outer world at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Management Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and destroyed, and mosques surrounded by water.
The aftershock continued in coastal cities on Saturday.
We felt a series of earthquakes in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Planning and Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said that the geographical and tsunami scale of the city, which is located on the edge of a long and narrow bay, may have expanded.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the victims' bodies were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage were worse than in the area called Donggala, 300 km (190 miles) north of Par, nearer to the epicenter.
"There was no information from Donggala and communication was completely out of order", Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it could get worse", he said.
Officials said the waves came during the warning, but on Saturday, authorities were widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami that hit Pearl.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of the building desperately warning people in the street below that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage and cut off communication around Pal, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun to transport relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities in cargo planes, but the evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue operations only, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Pal evacuation center on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the tsunami in Indonesia.
It's very bad.
World Vision staff in Dungar arrived safely in the city of Pal, where employees were evacuated to a waterproof sheet shelter set up in the courtyard of the office, but they saw a devastated landscape along the way, Dusseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
While relief organizations have begun to show signs of starting disaster relief efforts, some claim that foreign aid workers with deep expertise are being blocked from traveling to Pearl.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad are only allowed to be released if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the state level", said Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'I understand, this is a national disaster...' we can get international help, but we are not in that state yet".
On the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Pearl, friends and family of those still missing, and their loved ones, were hoping that the tragic story of the natural disaster was a miracle.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, along with her mother's body.
The Indonesian national paragliding team coach, Gendon Subandno, trained two missing paragliders from the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were among those trapped in the Loa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon went around the paragliding community a few hours after the news of the Loa Roa Hotel collapse, and said that he had been desperate to send a WhatsApp message to Pal's competitor who was attending the beach festival.
His message was marked with a grey checkmark instead of a blue checkmark.
"I think it means that the message didn't get through", he said.
A thief in Newport, La., stole $26,750 from an ATM while it was refilling.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, a Brink employee was filling up at the Newport ATM in Levy when thieves stole $26,750.
The driver of the car was preparing to empty the ATM at the entertainment complex and deliver more cash, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a release.
While he was working, another man stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered to Brink's employee by running behind him.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yeah.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yes.
On Saturday, he tweeted the change, saying, "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, is sometimes nicknamed "Y", which was also the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his Saturday Night Live appearance, which is expected to coincide with the release of his new album Yandhi.
He will be replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled due to "emotional reasons", the show's creators said.
As with the acronym of his current professional name, West has stated in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year, speaking about the radio host Big Boy and the title of his album.
"So I am you, I am us, and it is about us".
It begins with the crab, which is the only meaning, the reflection of all our good and bad and confused - yes.
It's more reflective of who we are".
He's one of the many famous rappers who change their names.
Sean Combs, known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Ditti or Didi, announced this year his choice of the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, also capitalized the hyphen.
AMLO in Mexico vows to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country marks the 50th anniversary of the student blood drive.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in the Plaza de la Terrilla that he would "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, when the left-wing student movement was rooted in Latin America, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide monthly subsidies to people studying, to expand the free access to the national universities, and to support Mexico's youth.
He said that youth are fleeing to crime gangs due to lack of employment and education opportunities.
The U.S. should double its funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double its research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after the US government's various departments issued AI warnings, which suggested that the US overall AI strategy lacked.
Meanwhile, China introduced a plan last year: to become the number one AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start considering that all other countries are much behind the US, and we are looking to make the next leap in AI, Lee said.
Doubling the money will also double the opportunity for the next big thing in American AI, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of SinoVision Ventures and investor in Face++, China's most prominent AI company.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an AI system that beat the top American player in the game of chess.
Lee agreed to participate in past US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and also visited when the next one would be to help find the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"China is not taking away academic leadership; it is taking away cooperation", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring leaders from universities that study AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy would also help strengthen the U.S. efforts on AI.
"I think that PhDs in AI should be automatically given a green card", he said.
China's State Council issued a decree on the next generation artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies paying US researchers, but the quality of academic research in China is low, Lee said.
In the United States, the Ministry of Defense earlier this year established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from business and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's going to invest $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
On the other hand, the US regulation to establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not been acted upon for several months.
The Macedonians are going to hold a referendum on changing the name of their country.
Macedonians are set to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia on Sunday, or hold a referendum, to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, said that the people of the north claimed its territory and voted to join NATO and the EU.
The government signed an agreement in June under the newly proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of Macedonia's main Slavic population.
President Georgi Ivanov did not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether his voting rate would meet the minimum 50 percent threshold for a valid referendum.
The question about the referendum was: "Do you support the agreement with Greece and its membership in NATO and the EU?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worthwhile for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia, to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"I came to vote today for the youth of Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
It is not legally binding, but a sufficient number of members of the House of Representatives will abide by the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Congress.
The election commissioner of the week said that no fraud had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Daso participated in the Macedonian referendum on the name change of the country that will open the way to NATO and European Union membership on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and pulled a chair in front of a tent erected by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate carefully, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonians, we can rely on other countries like China and Russia to be part of the European-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zeev says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will support the EU and NATO because more than 80 percent of the population supports them", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of the "yes" would be "proof of our future".
According to the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a poll released last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters said they would participate in the referendum - below the required turnout.
In another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV station Terma, 57 percent of respondents said they would go to the polls on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said they would vote in favor.
To be successful, a referendum requires 50% of the votes and one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
I'd like to recommend: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City to score a goal to overcome Brighton's full defence.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Sunday, to celebrate Manchester City's 2-0 victory over Brighton Defence.
Agüero scored in the 65th minute with a ridiculous ease.
The Argentine striker was passed in midfield in the series of starts.
He competed with three Brighton defenders before heading out to the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four other green shirts.
He pushed one defender, and he knocked down a few more on the edge of the Brighton box.
And he found Sterling and passed him to the left.
England's FW returned the ball to Aguero with a first touch inside the box, and used the right boot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, and hit the right side of the net.
"Aguero was struggling with foot problems", city manager Pep Guardiola told the Reporter.
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
He was the one who decided the score at that moment and we were lucky".
But it was Stirling who gave Sky Blue the early lead in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a deep reception in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a beautiful trail along the left bank to Leroy Sane.
Sané kicked Sterling a few times before he could get him to the front.
The Sky Blue forward put the ball in the net just before he slid into the line of scrimmage.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12.55pm at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Gensheim, Germany.
Scharzer wants to play Spoiler against the Rockies.
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so there's not much reason to start fresh.
However, the struggling Shazzer wants to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night to at least a wild card spot, but they want to make sure they win their first district championship.
"Even if we play pointless, we can at least throw, and the crowd combined with the atmosphere here in Denver and any other team we face this year will probably be the highest level of play.
You wouldn't want to fight like that, would you?"
The Nationals have not yet released their Sunday starters, but they are reporting that they will be able to welcome the Chargers to the pitch in such circumstances.
Scherzer is scheduled to make his 34th start, pitching Thursday in the bullpen and will pitch during the regular Sunday break.
This season, Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
The president, speaking of the importance of Republican voters in the midterm elections, made a roundabout reference to the Supreme Court's decision to elect Brett Kavanaugh.
"All that we have done depends on November.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big big ones, I'm not running, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates".
Trump continued, "Look at this horrible, radical group of Democrats, and you'll see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to use any means necessary to regain power, and they're not happy with the con.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to ignore to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
He said the Democrats' mission is to "resist, disrupt".
"And we'll see it in the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry, rude, disgusting and dishonest".
He was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and received a lot of opposition from the audience, including nominating and ranking Senator Diane Feinstein, a Democrat.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did the paperwork get leaked?
What?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
I can't stand people who talk about their feelings.
I was hardly surprised when the momentum activists of my local party voted to evict me.
After all, I am the first Labour MP to be said not to be welcome - all of which speaks to the spirit.
My colleague in the House, Joanne Ryan, was treated similarly for standing up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the move to condemn happened because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and the irony of it, Jeremy disagreed with his predecessor on the issue of Europe.
The announcement at the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said: "We want to make the meeting inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meeting was just that.
Sadly, today, not the tone of many meetings, but if it did start, the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy had long been forgotten.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not accept many views, and that all opinions are judged by whether or not they are accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and I started to see colleagues who I thought I shared similar political views turn against me, and take positions I hadn't taken before, such as agreeing on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I spoke publicly, there was a constant stream of harassment on social media, demanding the cancellation of the election, criticising the Centre's policies, and saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I think I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments I get tend to be political.
She is a woman who is confronted with sexist or racist abuse every day, but she is never shy and has a great respect for the professionalism and determination of her colleagues.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the degree to which abuse has become normalized.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn argued that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
It is true that we are no longer a broad church, and that any movement for "no confidence" or any change in party selection rules is becoming less and less.
For the last two years, I've been trying to be humble, not to be too loud, and I've been giving a lot of advice, like, "Everything's going to be okay".
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, spurred by the negligence of the Thatcher government that literally destroyed my comprehensive school classroom, I have worked to support better public services for those who need them most, whether I am a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my policies, including the last election.
There was no confusion in Nottingham East about my policy positions or where I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the movement on Friday, I can only say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour leader, as the country struggles to deal with Brexit, which is damaging to our families, our businesses and our public services.
But my message is not to the Nottingham moment, it is to my supporters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise that no outside threat or political expediency will ever override my belief that it is in your best interests to do so.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Air tops the list.
Although the final result may have changed somewhat due to two late attempts, the Air definitely deserves to win today's fantastic and entertaining tenant's premiership match.
They're currently at the top of the table, with only 10 undefeated sides.
And finally, it was a better chance for the home side to get a better defense, and Coach Peter Murch had every right to be happy.
"We have been tested throughout the game, and we should be happy that we are still unbeaten", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Trust the Air; they had a better chance than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th try instead of Frager Climo pushed the air forward, but the Warriors started the game, Lori Hughes's yellow card gave the numbers to Melrose, and Jason Bagott took the unconverted try.
Clymo extended his lead on the air with a penalty just before halftime, and went into the break with a 17-5 on the air.
But Melrose came in second, and Patrick Anderson's try from Baggot was reduced to five points.
After that, he was badly injured and had to wait for a long time for the retired Lulid Knott, and after the re-opening, Air was replaced by Climax and Stafford McDowall's try was even more advanced.
Air Acting Captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose was at the end of a spell of intense pressure, with Bruce Colvin's attempt to pay off the extra player.
However, the home side returned and Sturgeon Hutchinson tackled Climaux without the ball, receiving a yellow card and landing behind the Air Moor with McPherson advancing from the penalty line.
After Kyle Rowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong, Kramer almost restarted the game and sent Frank's Gregor Henry to the home side for a fifth try.
Still Game Star is building a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game Star's Ford Kieran appears to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after it is revealed that he has been named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56, writes and stars in the popular BBC show with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series would be the show's last, and Keenan appears to be planning his life after Craig Grann.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmoor Limited.
Scottish sources have suggested that Keenan may be involved in the "vibrant restaurant trade" in Glasgow, but the actor declined to comment on the story.
The sea is ours: Bolivia on the mainland wants the court to reopen the road to the Pacific.
The crew patrol the naval headquarters, equipped with the ropes of the lapis.
The blue flag of the sea is flown on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right".
It is our duty to restore it".
Through inland Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline of Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource wars, still vivid, is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the best in decades, as Bolivia awaits the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia is in a dynamic, united and calm spirit, and of course we are looking forward to the results with a positive view", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Carzadila.
Many Bolivians, watching the ICJ ruling on national TV screens, are hoping that the court in The Hague will, after decades of optimistic deliberation, agree with Bolivia's claim that Chile is obligated to negotiate its sovereignty to the sea.
Evo Morales, the indigenous leader of Bolivia who faces a controversy in his re-election next year, will also participate in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts say it's unlikely the court will rule in Bolivia's favor, and if it does, it won't change much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to grant Chilean territory or determine the possible outcome of negotiations.
The ICJ's ruling, which came just six months after the final debate, shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And it's far from pushing the Bolivian factor forward, which may have set it back in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
She suggested that Morales' bellicose rhetoric had broken the goodwill of the remaining Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it's extremely difficult to continue to discuss after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Verte, the former president of the country, denied the idea that the court's decisions are unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a special opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile" and bring "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement on mutual interests", he said.
He also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, has used the issue of the ocean as a political tool.
"Bolivia will never give up its access to the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to learn that we must move past the past".
North Korea says it won't do nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, says that if they cannot trust Washington, they will never dismantle their nuclear weapons in the first place.
Lee was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the US to abide by the promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments are being interpreted as those of the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently looking to reopen stalled nuclear diplomacy now that more than three months have passed since Singapore, where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was present.
Lee said that the US objection to the declaration to end the Korean War and to continue sanctions is "an imaginary dream" that would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is concerned that Pyongyang will agree to the declaration without first making significant moves to reduce its armed forces.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are hoping for a second summit.
But there is a skeptical view that Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning its weapons, which are the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show, with its massive headwear line, is being transported to the high street near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or block out the sun completely, this is the way to go.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a lineup of quirky oversize headgear for the stylish Lanway SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
So unrealistic hats have been taking over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching designs to the catwalk.
Valentino's most notable piece was an oversized beige hat with a wide brim that adorned the model's head with a feather-like plume.
Other oversized accessories, such as jewelry needles, witch hats, and even pineapples, were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has released another selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn up and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than an outsider.
One of the pieces looked like a full-size scuba diving gear with snorkel and goggles, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're going to continue your fashion philosophy, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the giant bonnet may be headed for the nearest high street.
Oversized hats, from Rihanna to Emily Ratzikowski, are getting hot on the heels of the two-foot-wide, straw hat "Ramboba" that everyone sees.
The cult brand behind the highly unrealistic hats that have been floating around social media has sent another big piece to Catwalk - a straw-bag that's almost as big as a model in a swimsuit.
The orange-coloured Lafia bag with a raffia rim and white leather handle was a standout in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques Moussa for Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "We expect big hats and beach bags to appear on the high street next summer - it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories as designers are having such a huge impact.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship
Scottish private schools maintain academic excellence, another set of excellent test scores that are only enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community achievements, and continue to do so until 2018.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which has over 30,000 students across Scotland, are committed to providing the highest level of service to students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for higher education, their chosen careers, and to live in society as global citizens.
In this sector, which can design and implement customized school curricula, modern languages continue to be a popular subject of interest in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak in a language that people understand, it goes into their heads".
But when you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
This reminds us that we should not rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
This year's recent test results show that the language is at the top of the league table and the pass rate of students in private schools is the highest.
A total of 68 percent of the students studying foreign languages obtained a higher grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 percent of students studying Beijing language get a higher grade A, while 72 percent of students studying German, 69 percent of students studying French and 63 percent of students studying Spanish also get an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are encouraging children and young people to learn foreign languages as an important skill that will definitely be needed in the future.
Today, language is treated as an elective subject in the curriculum of private schools, as well as in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers struggle to fill gaps were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a world where globalization is increasing the number of job opportunities that require language.
Whatever career you choose, if you're learning a foreign language, you've acquired a skill for life that will really benefit you in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign people means that multilingual talent has an advantage in the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults found that 75 percent of them did not have enough foreign language skills to converse, and that only 15 percent spoke French, a double-digit foreign language.
That's why investing in language education is so important for kids today.
For children, especially in developing countries, having the ability to speak more than one language will increase their chances of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, the language of instruction differs from school to school.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Beijing and Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, there are plenty of language options in private schools with specialists in this field.
Private schools in Scotland are focused on providing a learning environment that prepares children for the future and gives them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
In a global business environment, languages remain crucial to the future of the nation and need to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice and diversity and even better education to the young people of Scotland.
I have to do it.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron, the Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron James will soon make his fan-awaited LA Lakers debut.
Lakers manager Luke Walton announced that James will play in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But I don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one minute less than 48 minutes", Walton says on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would only be playing for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need a preseason game to prepare for the season", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, his YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump will begin a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five gatherings scheduled for next week, including in Trump-friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the Supreme Court nomination pending, Trump is looking to build support for the Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections, as they risk losing their majority in the House in the November elections.
I'm not sure what time Trump's rally in West Virginia is tonight, or how to watch it online.
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 pm EDT.
Trump's West Virginia rally can be viewed online via the following YouTube live stream:
Trump is likely to comment on this week's public hearing of Kavanaugh, as the FBI investigates allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the Senate's confirmation vote is delayed by up to a week and pressing.
But the main purpose of the rally is to give momentum to the Republican Party, which faces a difficult battle ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the Trump campaign is planning five rallies next week to "strengthen volunteers and supporters to secure Republican majorities in the Senate and House".
"Securing a majority in Congress is very important to his policies, so the president is planning to visit as many states as possible ahead of a busy election season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
According to Metro News of West Virginia, the rally scheduled for tonight at the Westbank Arena in Wheeling "may draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the media in Pittsburgh".
Trump won West Virginia by more than 40% in 2016, but Saturday's visit to West Virginia will be Trump's second in a month.
Trump is seeking to support West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Heider of West Virginia University said that "the president's coming to push him is not a good sign for Morrissey".
The U.S. Ryder Cup 2018 selection is looking to fight hopefully for Sunday's singles.
After three unsuccessful sessions, on Saturday afternoon Fortham was the Ryder Cup that he needed.
In sports, the concept of "strength" as a pendulum is unfounded, but in this particular competition, the athlete really believes in "strength".
So who's going to be the one with the momentum?
"They were up by six points, but now they're down by four, so I think we have a little bit of a lead", Jordan Spies said as he picked up the day.
Of course, the European selection has a four-point lead with 12 games left, and they're in the lead.
As Spies said, the US team is feeling the wind, playing together all day long, and there are many factors to consider, including the fact that Spies and Justin Thomas are doing well, with three points each in four games.
The spice is relentlessly attacking from the tea to the green, leaving an exemplary result.
He and Thomas were two points ahead after two holes, but as the round progressed, the cheers grew louder, and he hit the decisive pat and tied the game in the fourth.
The similar cry he made when he won the 15th hole putt was also a sign of his belief that the US team had not yet lost.
"You have to concentrate on your game and give it your best shot", Spears says.
Currently, these players are allowed to play only one game each.
18 holes to win.
Only Francesco Morinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spears and Thomas in the past two days, making them the Ryder Cup's biggest talking points.
The two, the odd and lovable European selection, won four of their four matches without making a single mistake.
Not only were they the only pair not to bogie in the Saturday afternoon session, but they also avoided bogeying in the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning at the late ninth hole.
In addition to these matches, the two players' energy in the midst of the fierce crowd makes it clear that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that no player is more popular than Fleetwood and Molinari, who are not expected to win the European final in the final of the Le Golf National.
I want them to achieve it simultaneously in a different hall.
However, the winner of the European selection is not yet decided.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, the heroes of the morning foursome, have easily defeated Sergio Garcia and Alex Nolan.
Garcia and Lennon were unable to recover after a bogey and two double bogeyes dug a grave on the first nine and a half holes.
On Sundays, there are no friends to help.
Fowler and Foursam are very interesting to watch up close, because of the interaction between the two pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the momentary changes in strategy.
The European team has been playing better as a team so far and has a big lead going into the final day, but this fourth session has shown that the US team, especially the American side, is willing to fight to clear the nerves.
The Ryder Cup is on its final day, and the European selection leads 10-6.
The European selection, which finished 10-6 in the U.S. standings after Saturday's four-ball and four-som game, is in a good position heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who are performing brilliantly, have extended their scoring record at the National to four points, with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods.
The European selection of Thomas Bjorn, who is aiming to win back the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazelton, dominated the disorderly US selection in the morning foul, scoring 3-1.
The U.S. team won two games at Forth, but still couldn't close the gap.
The U.S. team, led by Jim Furyk, needs to score eight points in Sunday's singles match to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood not only became the first European rookie to score four points in a row, but after a sensational weekend Fleetwood and Molinari became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in the first four games.
The two men won the match with an even more impressive 5&4 after losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-way tie, and a spectacular tie, which was also won by a dispirited Woods and rookie Bryson Deschamps.
Woods, who had a poor showing in Saturday's two games, also had a good run at times, losing 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome, as well as losing seven in a row.
After taking a break from the morning foursome, Justin Rose teamed up with Henrik Stenson at Foursome to defeat world number one and number three Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka 2 and 1.
The Southwest Paris course has been a nice day for the wind, but the European selection has not been as dominant as it could have been.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spies and Justin Thomas raised two points on Saturday to show the standard for the U.S. team.
They won the match in fours after defeating John Lamm and Ian Poulter 2-1 in fours, but lost the first two holes in the final to Poulter and Laurie McIlroy 4-3 in the final.
The U.S. team, led by Fury, has only twice in Ryder Cup history reversed a four-point lead in the singles, but can retain the trophy by winning the draw.
But for the U.S. team, who have been on the back foot for two days, Sunday's counterattack seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will never unilaterally disarm without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had increased mistrust of the United States and that it would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Lee Jung-hyun (Li Yong-ho) the foreign minister said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "important goodwill measures" in the past year, including the suspension of nuclear tests and missile launches, the dismantling of the nuclear test site, and the pledge not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see a response from the United States", he said.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm".
While Lee reiterated the familiar North Korean complaint that the US government has not reciprocated for North Korea's "phased" denuclearization approach, his statement is significant in that, unlike in the past, the North Korean government did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization.
Lee referred to the joint statement between Kim Jong Un and the North Korean leader at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 that Kim Jong Un pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump pledged to provide security for North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
The US government also resisted calls to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is opposed to the 'declaration of the end of the war' by putting more pressure on it with sanctions in order to achieve its goal of 'denuclearization first'", said Foreign Minister Li.
"The notion that we can be defeated by sanctions is an illusion of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that our suspicion is being heightened by the sanctions".
Lee did not mention the plans for Kim's second summit with Trump, which President Trump highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as deadlocked if the parties to the denuclearization issue were not the United States and South Korea".
Even so, Lee's tone in his speech was dramatically different from when he called Trump "the evil president" and said at last year's UN General Assembly that North Korean missiles were unavoidable from reaching the US mainland after Trump called him "rocket man" in a suicide bombing mission.
While Trump, who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, praised the country this year at the UN for its courageous efforts to disarm, he said there were many challenges and sanctions needed to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said, "It's going to take two or three years, it's going to take five months", and he didn't set the time frame.
China and Russia have objected to the UN Security Council's action against North Korea.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions must be strictly maintained until it is verified that complete and final denuclearization has taken place".
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile development.
Pompeo met with Lee during the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was fruitless.
He left Pyongyang in July to report progress, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gang-like demands".
North Korea promised to dismantle its missile and nuclear facilities if the United States took "comparable action" during a meeting with President Moon this month.
He says that the money he is seeking is a "response" to the security Trump promised in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with the US government.
And I'm a Harvard student who took a class on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard this year aims to get all undergraduates to get more sleep in order to combat the growing macho culture of taking caffeine and studying "all-night".
The students at Harvard, the best university in the world, are often ignorant of the very basics of how to care for the body.
Charles T. Saisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course. He says it is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He said he got the idea to start the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a female student came to me and said, 'Why did I wait until the fourth grade to hear this story?'
"I was surprised that no one had ever told her the importance of sleep", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced this year, will teach students how good sleep habits can promote learning and physical performance, and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health services, says the university decided to introduce the course after recognizing a severe sleep deprivation among students that week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books in their dorm room to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on exercise capacity, and the importance of bedtime classes.
In another section, he explains to participants how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Also, the interactive icon on the map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
"I know that students don't change their behavior immediately.
But they should have the right to know, just as they have the right to know how their choice of smoking affects their health", adds Professor Zweissler.
He also says that the culture of "studying all night" still exists, and that modern technology and the increased pressure on students have increased the problem of sleep deprivation.
Getting enough good quality sleep is the student's "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says, and sleep deprivation keeps the brain in a constant state of hunger, preventing weight gain.
Raymond Thor, 19, a California native who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped design his course after taking a class with Professor Zwisler at Harvard last year, when he was a freshman.
He was awakened by the course and wanted to expand the course to the entire campus.
His next step is to have all graduate students take a similar program before they start at the highly competitive Harvard.
Professor Tzaissler recommends that students set alarms at bedtime as well as at waking hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
The Rangers, led by Gerard, are down by a Manga goal.
Rangers were again defeated at home by a goal from Livingston's Dori Menga, and the Rangers lost 1-0 to Steven Gerrard.
The IJB-based Rangers were looking for their first away win since their 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager against Gary Holt's Livingston left the Rangers eight points clear of Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half, and after that, the Rangers, lacking inspiration, did not seem to score.
Rangers are currently in sixth place, but Livingston has moved up to third place behind Hibernian on points.
The Rangers may also face further trouble after linebacker Colum Spence was treated for a head injury after being thrown from an A-side seating area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the squad when he broke the air to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, maintained the same eleven as when he robbed Hertz of points last week. He would have been happy to have a well-trained member who would have tormented his opponent in every situation.
The Rangers won on possession, but Livingston was more effective in attacking from a lower position.
Just two minutes into the game, from the first pass of the game, midfielder Scott Pittman missed a defensive goal by Alan McGregor, but then went out on the sidelines and missed the decisive opportunity.
After that, the free kick from Keegan Jacobs in the penalty area was given to the star forward Craig Harket, and defending defender Alan Risgo shot, but only hit the back post.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but in the final third, they ended up playing based on hopeful observation rather than playing with confidence.
Colombian Alfred Morelos claimed the penalty when he collided with Stephen Lawrence after 15 minutes, but Chief Justice Stephen Thomson rejected Morelos' appeal.
The Rangers missed two shots in the first half, but former Rangers' GK Liam Kelly easily saved a header by Lasana Klibari and a single shot by Obi-Ejalia.
Livingston's first half 34-minute lead was against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that it was also the result of hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' setpiece in the penalty area.
Declan Gallagher passed to Scott Robinson, who calmly passed to Menga, who scored an easy goal, but Scott Airfield could not respond.
Gerard substituted Ryan Kent for Clibbery at halftime, but this was soon overtaken by a pass from Winger Clibbery to Morelos, who was blocked by Kelly from the goal line with a good save.
But Livingston, who was playing the game he knew best, handled the long balls with precision, with the risgo and the harquette coming in turn.
Holt's Livingston had a chance to extend the lead on the final play, but Jacobs' shot was blocked by McGregor's good save, and Risgo's header shot from the corner was later sidelined.
Rangers' Glenn Middleton, who was on the field, appealed the penalty when he was involved with Jacobs, but Thompson again rejected it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
A page from the "Sunday Morning" almanac: "On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany".
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, a device that eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Giger counter, the main force of science, has become a major force of pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientist.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
"If you put an earpiece on, you can actually hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radiation in the mineral".
Evans: "It's true. It sounds like it's playing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "recognize" malignant cells.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "identify" and kill the bad cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize the bad cells as part of the treatment.
This is a method of extracting immune cells from a patient and then modifying them in the lab.
And this allows the cells to "identify" the proteins that are common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
The experimental vaccine has shown promising results in a wide range of cancer patients.
In the case of the vaccinated women, whose immune system was trained to recognize malignant cells, their ovarian cancer was gone for more than 18 months.
In this way, by taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the lab, we can "identify" a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then we can re-inject these cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that the vaccine is effective".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explains Professor Belzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from a patient and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been found to be effective in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West wore a MAGA cap on SNL and was a Trump supporter.
That's what gets the bad press.
Kanye West bounced back to Donald Trump in the studio during his appearance on Saturday Night Live, bowing out that he would run for president in 2020.
West sang the third song of the night, "Ghost Town", with a "Make America Great Again" MAGA cap, then repeated his pro-Trump rhetoric against the Democrats.
"I've talked to white people, and they've said, 'How can you like playing cards, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
The SNL show of the day began with a dramatic sequence starring Hollywood star Matt Damon, who quoted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee against the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blaze Ford.
The video of West's rant was not aired, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Locke intended to mock West in the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had to work hard on the backstage for the hat.
"I was bullied backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with your hat on".
I'm being bullied!
And the Washington Examiner says, "I'm at the bottom of the barrel".
West said, "You want to see the bottom?" And he said, "I'll put on a Superman mantle, and then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want to go forward in the world?"
Then you must try love".
His comments prompted at least two booing from the audience, and the SNL cast member appeared confused, Variety reported, with one person in the audience saying, "The whole studio went silent".
West was invited by his former rapper Mac Miller to replace the late Ariana Grande.
West confused many by wearing a Perrier bottle and singing "I Love It".
The leader of the conservative group USATP, Candice Turner, tweeted in support of West: "To the bravest of spirits: Thank you for standing up to the mob".
But the host of the show, Karen Hunter, simply tweeted that West was "very, very cool".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone who spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his 'art.'
He's free to go.
We are too", she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but he is following in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Phaddi, Pafi, and Pdiddi.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also goes by the name Snoop Lion, and of course the music legend Prince, after changing his name to Symbol, also changed his name to "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince".
The attempted murder of a man in a Belfast restaurant.
A man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday, and a 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder.
Police say the incident took place in the town of Barry Hackmore.
On Monday, the accused will appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court.
The charges are examined by the prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, is attacking his toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow, the sword master in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But 31-year-old Kitt attacked the stereotype of such macho heroes, saying that because of such roles on screen, boys feel they must be strong to be respected by others.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something was wrong" and asked how he could address the toxic issue of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, said he felt "very strongly" about tackling the issue.
"We feel very strongly, personally, at this moment, that we are doing something wrong with masculinity", he said.
What have you taught these kids growing up about the problems we're seeing?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continues, "What is born and what is taught?
Do they feel that they have to be men with certain qualities because of what they have seen on TV and in the street?
And I think that's one of the big questions of our time, how do we change that?
"I'm not sure what's wrong with him.
In the interview, he also said that he was done with the battlefield and horses, and that he would not talk about prequels or sequels after Game of Thrones ends next summer.
In November, she will appear in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a movie producer and his brother who is a thief.
He said that the best thing he's done in Game of Thrones recently was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, and she kind of gave me a future family and a future life", he says.
Rose played Igrit, the love interest of John Snow, who plays Kitt in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
They married in June 2018 at their home in Leslie, Scotland.
In China, the number of new cases of HIV/AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
China announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, and changes from the past have been observed.
In China, HIV spread rapidly in some areas as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to last year.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In China, where homosexuality was legalized in 1997, discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
Research estimates that 70 to 90 percent of gay men will eventually marry women, due to the country's conservative values.
Many infections occur in these relationships when precautions are not in place.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make anti-HIV drugs more widely available as part of its response to the problem.
He denied the leak of data from the Republican senator by Maxine Waters and her staff, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that one of her staff members posted personal information on three Republican senators on her Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party has claimed that this claim is being made by "ultra-right" critics and websites.
"Lies, lies, vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home address and phone number of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Olin Hutch.
This information was posted online by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill Thursday during a Senate committee hearing on the alleged sexual assault of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This data breach occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState have claimed that the IP addresses from which the posts originated belonged to Waters' office, and have also published information about Waters' employees, The Hill reports.
"This unfounded claim is a complete fabrication and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"My staff, whose identity, privacy and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, have no involvement whatsoever in the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is a complete lie, absolutely false".
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online by people including former White House press secretary Ali Fleisher.
"This denial is nothing but anger", Freisher wrote.
"This shows that she is not fit to be a member of the House of Representatives.
If you are accused of something you did not do, do not be angry.
You must not be arrogant.
You must not question the motives of the accused.
"You must be calm and calm".
Fleisher appears to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism from Democrats that he was too angry about Judge Kavanaugh's behavior at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"That's really cool", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters says her office "communicated these false allegations to the authorities and the police".
She said, "We will do everything we can to find the perpetrator", and added, "I will hold the perpetrator, my staff, legally responsible for their destructive and dangerous acts".
"Johnny English: The Reverse of Analog" movie review - a parody of the powerless
Recently, it has become common to find the implications of Brexit in new films depicting the decline of Britain, but this seems to be true of the sequel action comedy Johnny English. The series has previously released "Johnny English" in 2003 and "Johnny English Retirement" in 2011.
Could this self-cartoon, satirical and self-deprecating, of how incompetent we are, be a new export opportunity for Britain?
In any case, the eye-catching, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English is a repeat offender in this film, and his name suggests that he is a comedy made for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He's, of course, a silly secret agent who presumes that he has sophisticated charm, but he has all the elements of a character who played only one note of the flaming runner theme song at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
Johnny English was originally based on the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, which had been played by Atkinson, a mysterious world traveler who causes trouble everywhere.
There's one or two good scenes in this latest film.
I like the part where Johnny English, wearing a medieval helmet, approaches the helicopter and the rotor blade hits the helmet.
Atkinson's comedic talent is also shown, but his humor is quite weak and strangely redundant, especially considering that "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible have also included comedic elements.
The humor feels more childish than adult, and to me, Johnny English's quirky adventures are less original and less focused than Atkinson's silent-film gag in Mr. Bean.
The film is based on the ongoing debate about the UK's current serious problems.
A cyber-hacker breaks into the British spy network and exposes the identities of all British agents in the field. The agent in charge (Kevin Elton, unfortunately in a small role) is horrified.
For a Prime Minister who already had many problems and a declining popularity, this news was beyond the pale. Emma Thompson, who plays this Theresa May parody well, is not going to go into the script.
Her wise advisor says that since the identities of all active spies have been made public, she has no choice but to recruit retired spies.
That's why Johnny English, who works as a headmaster at a prestigious school and teaches how to be a secret agent, if he wants to be a secret agent, is also a voice.
English heads to the White House for an urgent briefing and is reunited with his long-suffering former colleague, Boff (Ben Miller).
Boff is now married to a submarine commander, a hot-blooded character who is not like Vicky Pepperdine.
And then, the former secret service of Her Majesty's secret service is resurrected and meets the beautiful Fem Fatar, Ophelia Britowa, played by Olga Kurylenko.
The Prime Minister, on the other hand, is following the lead of charismatic billionaire Jason Volta, who claims to be the solution to Britain's computer woes.
English and Bo, as before, cause several problems: impersonating a waiter, setting fire to a luxurious French restaurant, causing a riot while trying to break into Volta's luxurious yacht, and causing a big mess when English tries to use a virtual reality headset to find out about Volta's house.
True, all the tricks converge on the final mountain, but this beloved comedy of the dots is, in general, a children's show.
It's pretty common.
And as I felt in other Johnny English films, the British film industry couldn't help but wonder if they could give Rowan Atkinson a role that was worthy of his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is considering a plan to pay the nation five days' wages for a four-day workweek.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to pay the public five days' pay for a four-day workweek.
The party hopes that corporate executives will share the money they have earned through the AI revolution with workers by increasing their salaries.
In this scheme, the employee is expected to work three days a week for the same pay.
The source said that this idea is in line with the party's economic policy and plans to make the country more profitable for workers.
The move to a four-day work week is also being hailed by the Labour Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: 'The policy review is due to be published by the end of the year.'
"While it is not something that can be done overnight, a four-day work week is a goal that fits into the party's overall industrial strategy and approach to reorganizing the economy in the interests of workers".
The Green Party has pledged to a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign, and Labour is not the first to support the idea.
However, not all Labour members are currently in favour of this goal.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not a party policy and the party has not considered it".
Shadow Minister John McDonnell outlined his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at a labor conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless officials" and "undue beneficiaries" of the utility companies.
The Shadow Minister's plan also means that the Labour government can "deduct" because it has acknowledged wrongdoing, and the current shareholders of the water company may not be able to recover their full stake.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards, create a general ownership fund with 10% of the capital of private companies, and give employees an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether the FBI might change its mind about the Cabano investigation in "60 Minutes".
The FBI's investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh's allegations has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and the bureau's findings have raised questions about whether the Senate's Republican support could be jeopardized.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Perry asked Republican senators Lindsey Gram and John Kennedy if they could find anything that would change the FBI's mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague, Graham.
"No", said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the hearing. I said I spoke to Judge Cabano.
And then, because of this, because of the accusation, I called him and said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, he was clear".
But it seems that the Gram vote is unchangeable.
"I am determined that Brett Kavanaugh will be severely reprimanded", he said.
"I don't know what happened, Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it".
"And no one who she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host its annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival, where many of its most impressive stars perform, and equally impressive is its mission to end world poverty.
This year, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn to enjoy the performances of the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight for it.
To receive free tickets to the event (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions", that included volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls, or doing something meaningful to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But after 12 years, how much has Global Citizen Festival achieved?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts an honest way to get them to take action, or is it just another case of clickism, signing an online petition or tweeting to feel like you've done something meaningful?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by supporters, promoting various goals.
These actions have led world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 225 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds have directly impacted some 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementer partnership committed to "helping children grow to their full potential". The group received over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, pledged $35 million to Rwanda, and pledged to help end malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, funders, governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past", Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Woolman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that there were more than 5,000 actions in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, a project to help 5 million women and children get nutrition.
And the answer to the question, "Do you think we can end extreme poverty?" on the FAQ page on their website, is "Yes".
Global Citizenship said, "It's going to be a long, hard road.
But we can succeed, because we have the power, together, to do what the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements did.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to blockade Russia's energy exports, says Home Secretary
The U.S. government can rely on the Navy in the region, including the Middle East, "if necessary", to prevent Russian energy from hitting the market, Interior Secretary Ryan Zink has revealed, the Washington Examiner reports.
Zink argued that Russia's involvement in Syria is a pretext to open up new energy markets, especially if it is acting on behalf of a legitimate government.
"The reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just like Eastern Europe and Southern Europe".
Officials say there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can make sure that the silos are open and can block energy from entering the market if necessary", he said.
Mr. Zink was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that is establishing itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that both companies are virtually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use more or less fossil fuels to replace them", he said, and Russia was an economically fossil fuel-dependent "wanton pony".
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe as a much cheaper alternative to Russia for European consumers.
That's why Trump administration officials, including President Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the idea that energy should not be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier.
The US stance provoked German backlash, and Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of Industry (BDI), Germany's leading industry association, has called on the United States not to comment on the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem for a third country to interfere with our energy supply", said Dieter Kemp, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look closely" at her 2020 presidential bid, says a Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "look closely" at the presidential candidates after the midterm elections.
At the city hall in Hol York, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
According to Hill, she said, "It's time for women to come to Washington and rebuild the failed government, including women at the top".
"From November 6th, I will be looking very closely at the presidential candidates".
Warren joined the discussion during a town hall, saying that President Donald Trump "led this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy", she said.
Warren has been sharply critical of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she will run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Science Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "likely" Massachusetts voters said that a senator should not run.
32% of the votes were in favor of the candidate.
Polls show that the former governor, Deval Patrick, is more likely to be a candidate, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic politicians discussed in the 2020 race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make a formal decision by January, according to the AP.
Sarah Palin mentioned her PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump.
Truck Parrin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged Monday night in a domestic violence case.
"I feel for what my son is going through, what he's going through on his return, and I feel for other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the trauma that soldiers are going through on their return", she told the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, stubborn, wondering if their fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other members of the military have that much respect for what they have given to the country".
According to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, for obstruction of reporting of domestic violence and possession of a concealed weapon, and charged with domestic violence against a woman.
18 states and Washington D.C. support the opposition to the new refugee policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed court advisory reports in Washington on Friday, endorsing the appeal of the refugee policy, according to NBC News.
The Grace Sessions lawsuit was filed against federal policy by the American Civil Liberties Union in August. The plaintiff's full name is not disclosed.
She said that she was abused by her partner and "his violent gang members", but the US authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys for Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala face widespread gang and domestic violence problems, and that there are numerous asylum requests in the United States.
The new U.S. refugee policy overturns a 2014 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum without documents.
Attorney General Carl Lasine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all refugee claims be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a hurdle violates that principle", the court counsel report stated.
The secretary also said in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry while claiming they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the labor needed" would hurt the U.S. economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that no more victims of domestic violence or gang violence who fled in June will be granted asylum by immigration officers.
"Asylum is available to people who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
Asylum is not intended to alleviate all the problems that people around the world face every day, even all the serious problems.
A desperate rescue operation in Pal, with a doubling of the death toll, in the midst of a battle to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation became more dire.
"He seems very nervous", said Lisa Kxuma, a 35-year-old mother who gave birth to a hot baby boy in the shelter of a burned-out Pal.
"The ambulance will be here every minute or so.
There is hardly any clean water".
The people were returning to their destroyed homes, picking up their water-logged belongings, and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded after the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who had been injured in his back and shoulders, were resting outside Pauls Army Hospital, where the patients were being treated outdoors due to the strong aftershock.
When he remembered the time when the fifth floor of the hotel room he was in with his wife and daughter was shaken by a strong earthquake, tears came to his eyes.
"There was no time to run.
I think I was trapped in a collapsed wall", Harris told the AP news agency, and that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and the child.
I hope you're safe".
The US ambassador has condemned the Chinese "bullying" campaign.
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper for propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday blamed China for trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, but denied it, and then referred to a paid ad in the Chinese Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election was a new stage in Washington's campaign to put more pressure on China, as US officials told Reuters.
While trade promotion ads are commonplace for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are now in the midst of an escalating trade war, imposing uniform tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported the Trump-led Republican Party in the early days of the trade war, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, and the U.S. ambassador to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China's Branstad posted in the comments section of the Demoin Register on Sunday that "propaganda advertising aggression against our country's press freedom is intensifying".
According to Branstad, "the Chinese government is exploiting the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press for its own benefit by publishing paid ads in the Democrat Register to spread propaganda".
"In contrast, here at the Beijing street-side newsstands, you only see limited dissent and you don't see anything that truly reflects the different opinions that the Chinese people have about China's confused economic trajectory. The media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish my article". He did not mention any specific newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Cabaner uproar could lead to a Republican retreat of female voters ahead of the midterm elections.
Many Republican leaders have defended Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh over multiple sexual assault testimony. Analysts warn that Republicans will be facing a backlash from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The turmoil has caused a lot of emotion. Most Republicans are already hoping to go to the polls.
In an article in The Hill published on Saturday, Professor Grant Lear of the political science department at LaCrosse University, said, "We cannot go back and verify facts".
Professor Liller said it was doubtful that Senator Jeff Flake's push for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to appease voters' anger.
According to the Washington, D.C., newspaper, on Friday, Karine Jean Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group Movement, said, "Women don't forget what happened yesterday, and they won't forget it tomorrow, and it will be remembered until November".
On Friday morning, protesters outside the Senate, who were protesting against the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee's decision to proceed with Cabaner's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Brasley Ford, shouted, "November is coming!"
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be immeasurable", said Stu Rosenberg, a political analyst outside the party, to the news site.
"This is a very high-end building", he said.
But it could be higher, especially among women voters in urban areas and young voters aged 18 to 29 who have a low opinion of the president, and who are generally low voters".
Analysts suggest that if the Republican Party pushes for approval, there will be a backlash in the face of public testimony that Mr. Ford was sexually assaulted by a Supreme Court Justice nominee.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Souttil last week said, "This is a tremendous turmoil for the GOP".
Guy Cecil, a Democrat campaign aide, told the news channel that "the issue is not just the committee vote or the final vote on whether to appoint Mr. Kavanaugh, but how the Republicans handle this uproar and how they handle her".
However, the American people are divided as to which of the two testimonies, Mr. Ford and Mr. Cabaner, should be believed, and it seems that the latter is the majority.
According to a YouGov poll, 41% of respondents said they absolutely/probably believe Ford's testimony, while Cabanera was 35%.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavner was probably/absolutely lying in his testimony, and 30 percent said that Ford was lying.
At the urging of Mr. Fleck, the FBI is investigating Mr. Ford's testimony as well as that of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Mr. Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he was assaulted by Mr. Cabaner, who was drunk when he was 17.
Mr. Ramirez also testified that a Supreme Court nominee had exposed his genitals while attending a party at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web, the people who planned to start a new Internet to replace Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup that was going to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project from the legendary tech entrepreneur, and it's built on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid gives users choices about where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt is "world conquest".
And he said, "This is something that we should do right now".
"This is a historic moment".
This app allows you to create your own "personal online data store" (POD) using Solid's technology.
This includes contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This is a web browser that can be accessed from a single browser at the same time, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, Spotify.
The unique feature of a personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
Inrupt calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the right skills to enable anyone to use Solid.
Inrupt is currently comprised of the security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, the on-staff developers contracted to the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are "talking about introducing a complete change in the business model of Facebook and Google that would turn them upside down overnight".
"I'm not asking them for permission".
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Lee said of Inrupt, "The mission is to provide the commercial energy and ecosystem that will ensure the integrity and quality of the new web being built on Solid".
Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT in 1994 and transformed the Internet.
Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate for the past few months.
Berners-Lee, even as he was leading the launch of Inrupt, retained his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next generation of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: A ceremony is held to honor the Victoria Cross recipients of the First World War.
The ceremony was held in his hometown, 100 years after he was ordained as a priest in the Church of England, and was the only Anglican priest to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War.
The Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van was awarded the Medal of Honor for the Battle of Berngries and Rookhor on 29 September 1918.
Little did he know, however, that four days later he was killed by a sniper and was to be honored with the highest honour in the British Army.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said the monument was "incredibly symbolic" and that it was unveiled to the public exactly 100 years after his grandfather's achievement was decorated.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led a company through the Canal du Saint-Canton "in very thick fog and with fierce fire from the front and machine guns".
Then, with "great courage", he rushed to the front of the fire, with a small gun in one hand, pushed back the front and repulsed three divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month after the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, says of his grandfather's behavior, "I can't imitate it, but it's also humiliating".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, held a grand celebration after a parade led by the Royal Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said, "It was a great honor to be part of the parade". He added, "It was a true hero's courage, and it was proven by the support of many people".
All I could see was a bunch of MMA fans and Peppa Pig who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206.
Imagine how you felt when you couldn't see the main event despite spending the night watching Verrator 206.
The Sannoze Bill consisted of 13 episodes, six of which were shown on Channel 5 overnight.
At 6 a.m., while Gegair Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the broadcast was switched to Peppa Pig, which also got the attention of British viewers.
The viewers, who stayed up until the early hours of the morning for this match, were particularly discouraged.
One fan tweeted that the children's show was "some kind of bad joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said, "At 6 a.m., it seems that the government's regulations that martial arts are not suitable for viewing forced us to switch to a children's program".
"It's a good thing you're a peppapig".
Bellator president Scott Cocker has said that he will consider adjusting the schedule in the future to accommodate British viewers.
"I think it's going to be a little bit longer than that", he said.
"But, it was 6 a.m. on a Sunday, and I couldn't adjust to the time of the broadcast this Sunday, Monday in the UK.
We're in the process of adjusting.
When the broadcast was switched, there were a lot of texts, all of them were very displeasing.
I tried to restore it. I thought it was a technical defect.
But it wasn't. It was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen again in the next show.
I'm going to reduce it from six to five games, as I usually do.
This was an unfortunate situation".
I was a little bit of a downer when I was playing Tom Daley on the Desert Island Disc.
Olympic diver Tom Daray grew up feeling inferior to others in terms of sexuality, and this became his motivation for success.
The 24-year-old player didn't realize he was "different" until he was in middle school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren Lavern, Darell spoke about gay lights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, had been absent for months due to illness.
LaVern was cast as a way out in the first episode of the show, and said that he felt "less than" than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, inferiority and alienation have always been real, and have given me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove to himself that he was "worth something" and that if his sexuality came out, he would not disappoint anyone.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a major LGBT campaigner, appearing at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year and appealing to more countries to legalize same-sex marriage.
The player, who is lucky to be able to live without hindrance while being open about his sexuality, says he is speaking out to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion, the athlete, and the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, were in love with each other. She said that she was "surprised" when she met him in 2013.
The athlete, Darley, married Black, who won an Oscar at the age of 20. However, he said the age difference was not a problem at all.
"I've been through a lot since I was very young", said Dele, who first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14. Three years later, he lost his father to cancer. He said it was hard to find a contemporary with such a high level of experience who had lived such a life of ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, he says, changed "all of our values" with his birth.
"If you had asked me about it last year, I would have said that winning the gold medal was everything", he says.
"But in reality, it's more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, the Olympic gold medal is the lobby".
He was diagnosed with a brain tumor and took the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Dalé said that his father could not accept his death. One of his last words was, "Are tickets for the 2012 London Olympics already booked?" He said he wanted to watch the games in the front row.
"When I was in the front row watching the game, I couldn't tell that I was no longer in the world", he says.
"I held my father's hand until he stopped breathing. When he stopped breathing, he died, and for the first time I realized that he was not invincible".
The following year, the athletes from the Dalé competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment, I thought this was all I wanted in life", he said. "I thought there was nothing more pleasurable than diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics".
And this experience inspired the first selection of the Darling song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which echoes his own growth process on his way to the Olympics.
This is the first episode of the new series.
Mickelson, who was in a bad way in Saturday's Ryder Cup, is on the bench.
Phil Mickelson, the American rider, is set to set a new record in his 47th Ryder Cup fight on Sunday, but he needs to revise his form to avoid an unfortunate result.
Looking to set a record for the most appearances in the biennial event, 12 of Mickelson's players were called to the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's foreball and foursomes.
The five-time major champion, who has been the subject of numerous U.S. competitions, will now step aside from his role as a cheerleader and take part in the competition. The goal is to eliminate the cause of the disorder.
For him, the pinnacle of his career is not a perfectly straightforward driver. The 48-year-old Mickelson is not in the ideal condition to challenge at Le Golf National, where long-range running leads to miss shots.
The course itself is tough, but in Sunday's ninth match, the champion of the British Open, Francesco Malinari, will face the rookie Tommy Fleetwood, who has won all four matches this week.
If the U.S. starts with a four-point deficit in 12 singles matches, it will be a hot fight from the start, and Mickelson's match will be decisive.
Mr. Furyk said he had confidence in Mickelson, but didn't say much else.
"He understood well the role he had to play today", says Furyk, "and he would tap me on the back, shrug, and say, 'I'm ready for tomorrow.'"
"I'm pretty sure of myself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's done a lot for the team in the past, and that's not going to change this week.
I never imagined he would play two games.
I was thinking about playing more, but I was adjusted like this because I thought it was a necessary step.
He wants to be more involved, as he and everyone else do".
Mickelson will set the record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday, beating Nick Fard's record.
This could end Mickelson's career in the Ryder Cup. His record has never been matched by his personal best.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws. However, Furyk says his presence gives the team a spiritual base.
"He's funny, he's cynical, he likes to give people a little bit of a hard time, and he's a good person to have in the team room", she explained.
"This week, the young players seem to enjoy working with him.
He brings more than play".
And I'm not going to say that I'm not going to be a great leader, but I'm going to be a great leader.
European captain Thomas Bayonne has learned from his own experience that even if he is leading the race at the start of the Ryder Cup final day, the situation can change.
The Danish player made his debut for the national team in 1997 in Vardrama. The team, led by Seve Ballesteros, was five points ahead of the United States, but managed to win by a margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2 points.
And Bjorn, pictured here, at Le Golf National, after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday, he said, "Remember, we had a big lead at the Waldrama, we had a big lead at the block line, and we lost that time.
This history shows that my team and I are not done yet.
So, we'll do our best tomorrow as well.
I just go out there and do what I have to do.
The game is not over until the score is displayed.
We have a goal, and that is to win the trophy. We will put all our energy into this goal.
I've been saying this for a long time, and I'm very passionate about the 12 players on my team, but I know what they're like. They're the best players in the world".
While expressing his delight that his team is working on a challenging golf course, Bion adds: "I never get complacent.
Tomorrow is the enemy of tomorrow.
Tomorrow is a personal performance and a different element.
When things are going well, it's great to be with your teammates, but in a one-on-one match, all of your golf skills are tested.
We have to send this message to all the players and tomorrow we will do our best.
This time he has to leave his team, and his team has to do their best".
In contrast to Mr. Bion, Mr. Jim Furyk aims to make the players he coaches work more individually than as a team. The exceptions are Jordan Spies and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Mr. Furyk himself has experienced both sides of the issue of the final day of destiny. In the past, his team led the way at the Brooklyn line, but was ultimately defeated by the European team, who caused the "Miracle of the Medina".
When asked about the time when the captain, Ben Crenshaw, called the players on the final day in 1999, he said, "I remember every word very clearly".
"There are 12 important games tomorrow, and we expect the kind of upheaval seen in Brooklyn and Medina to begin soon.
And when you get the momentum, you have a lot of pressure in the middle.
We've been strategizing for the situation, we've been intuitively selecting people, and we're going to do miracles tomorrow".
Thomas is scheduled to be promoted, and will face top-ranked Laurie McIlroy in the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Lamb, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face top-ranked Europe.
"I put the players in this order because I think it's the best way to get through the whole thing", explained Bion about the singles selection.
The new German military and the postponement of the
The German Navy planned to upgrade its aging Cold War-era warships to modern frigates in 2014, but due to system problems and rising costs, it was not expected to be possible until at least next year, local media reported.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman, the launch of the lead ship of the newest frigate of the Barden-Württemberg class, the Rhineland Falts, has been extended until the first half of 2019.
The battleship was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014, but after a series of problems with the delivery, the ambitious plans were largely abandoned.
The Navy has ordered four Barden-Württemberg-class frigates in 2007 to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
The Baden-Württemberg-class frigates are characterized by the use of stealth technology such as low-frequency radar, infrared signals, and acoustic signals, in addition to powerful cannon, anti-aircraft, and anti-ship missiles.
Another important feature is the long maintenance cycle. It is possible to deploy the same frigate for up to two years to a location far from the home port.
However, the newspaper notes that the delays in the project mean that the newest warships, which are supposed to play a key role in showing Germany's military power abroad, will be outdated by the time they actually enter service.
The F125 frigate became big news when the German Navy officially refused to take her into service last year and she was towed back to Brome-und-Foss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a warship to a shipbuilding company after its delivery.
Details of the reasons behind the return are unclear, but German media quotes information that several "serious software and structural defects" were found that rendered the warship unsuitable for combat missions.
The software flaw is particularly significant, as the Barden-Württemberg-class frigates are manned by about 120 sailors, half the number required by the Brehmen-class a generation earlier.
The Borden-Würtenberg-class frigates are very heavy, which limits the Navy's ability to perform and upgrade in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland Falts" is said to be twice the weight of the same class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the structural defects, the cost of the project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
The cost of the entire project has ballooned from the initial 22 thousand euros to the current 31 thousand euros (36 thousand US dollars).
Recently, the German Navy has been warned of a weakening force, and the issue of this newest frigate has become very important.
Earlier this year, the German Parliament's defense minister, Hans-Peter Barthels, admitted that the navy was indeed "running out of ships with enough capacity to deploy".
The Chairman said that the problem is getting more serious with time, as the use of old warships is being discontinued and there are no replacement warships.
The co-chairman also expressed regret that the Baden-Wurtenberg class frigates were not being introduced in the Navy at all.
The National Trust, the mystery of the bat.
A new study, conducted on a site in the Highlands of Scotland, aims to reveal how bats use terrain to hunt.
The study is expected to provide new information about the behavior of this unique flying mammal and contribute to future conservation efforts.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, tracked species such as the common bat, the Soprano pipistrel, the brown-winged wren and the dormant tooth saw in Inverway Gardens in Westeros.
A dedicated recorder is installed at the main points of the site and the activity of the bats is tracked throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using portable sensors.
All recorded sounds are analyzed by experts to determine the frequency of the calls of the bats, as well as what the species is doing.
Based on the analysis, habitat maps and reports are produced, detailing the behavior of bats in accordance with the terrain.
Rob Duver, NTS's nature conservation adviser, hopes the study will reveal where the most important habitats for bats are and how they are used by various species.
This information is useful in determining the merits of habitat management activities, such as how to establish habitat and implement forest protection for bats and related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the number of bats has declined dramatically over the last 100 years.
The bat is threatened with extinction due to construction and habitat loss, which affects the status of the trees.
In addition to the chemical treatment of paper and building materials, attacks from pet cats, and wind turbines and lighting are also a risk for bats.
In fact, the crab is not blind.
But bats are nocturnal and have a tendency to rely on hearing rather than sight for their predatory activities.
Bats use their highly developed reflex-positioning abilities to spot insects at pinpoints and to recognize obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which manages 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and more than 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taking the bat very seriously.
The NTS has 10 experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the trees for bats, and sometimes protect the bats.
The NTS also has the first dedicated bat reserve in Scotland at the Sleeve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats found in Scotland.
David Thompson, who manages the estate, says that the land is ideal for bats.
"This is the best place for bats", he says.
"There are old buildings here, and there are a lot of old trees, and all of these are part of the right habitat for bats.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, and so our work here and elsewhere can help us understand what it takes for bats to breed".
He said it was important to check the bats before carrying out conservation work in the land, as even one bat accidentally destroying a tree where it is breeding could kill up to 400 females and young bats, and could lead to the extinction of the land's bats.
Bats are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, abuse, tamper with or cut down any tree.
Elizabeth Ferrell, who is a member of the Scottish branch of the Bat Conservation Trust, is calling for support from the local community.
"There's still a lot to learn about the bats in Scotland, and we really don't know how they behave", he said.
Ronoud denies rape charges, lawyers are ready to sue his own magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape allegations against him as "false", and says that the accuser "just wants to promote themselves" by using his name.
Mr. Ronow's lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly magazine Die Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese forward has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathleen Mayorca in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Ronald also allegedly asked the woman to hand over $375,000 and pretend the case never happened, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the news broke, 33-year-old Ronaldo took to Instagram to call the news "fake news" to his 142 million followers in a live video.
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
"The news that we have today is fake news", Ronaldo, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, told the camera.
"The magazine wants to use my name to promote themselves.
It's common.
They want to put my name out there and promote their own magazine. That's what they do.
I'm fine, I'm fine, there's nothing wrong with me", he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronoud's lawyers are preparing to sue DEA Spiegel over the allegations, and have criticized the magazine for "reporting in an unacceptable way on the sphere of privacy".
According to lawyer Christian Schultz, Ronaldo is seeking "compensation commensurate with the gravity of the violation, perhaps one of the most serious human rights violations of recent times".
The current incident is said to have occurred in 2009 in the suite of the Palm's Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Majorga met at a nightclub and then went to Ronaldo's room, where Ronaldo allegedly raped Majorga's fiancée.
Mayorga says that Ronald got down on his knees after the incident in question and said that he was a "99%" "good person" who was "in the wrong" 1% of the population.
According to the document, Ronaldo admitted that the two had a sexual relationship, but said it was consensual.
Mallorca also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at the hospital, but later settled out of court because she was afraid of "the fear of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old Mayorga is now calling for the settlement to be withdrawn as the trauma of the alleged incident continues.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus for €1.
The British people will forever regret the loss of the car industry.
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that Britain would "forever regret" losing its position as the world's leading carmaker to Brexit.
The minister added that British Toyota had told the BBC that it was "concerned" that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would suspend manufacturing at its Barnaston plant.
Clark, the Minister of Business has said that "we need a deal".
The Japanese carmaker says that delays at the border would cause losses for its business if Brexit is agreed without a deal.
The Oris and Avensis are manufactured at Toyota's Barnaston plant, and 90 percent of the 150,000 cars built last year were exported to countries outside the UK and the European Union.
Marvin Cook, the head of Toyota's Barnaston plant, said that "if the UK is forced to leave the EU at the end of March, production at the plant will be stopped".
Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and other British carmakers have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW is closing its Oxford Mini factory one month after Brexit.
The concerns of car manufacturers are centred on the supply chain risks of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production lines operate on a "Just in Time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made vehicles.
According to the automotive industry, if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, it could lead to delays at the border and delays or shortages of parts.
Toyota has announced that it will stop manufacturing at its Derbyshire plant because it cannot maintain a daily inventory of more than one.
Mr. Clarke said that the "Checkers Plan" that Prime Minister May has put forward for the future of our relationship with the EU "is being finely crafted to avoid the border checks that the industry is concerned about".
"We need a deal, which means we want to have the best deal possible, not just to enjoy the success we have, but to give this event a chance", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"What Toyota and other companies are showing is that we need to be able to continue the supply chain that has been working so well".
Toyota does not know how long the shutdown will last, but in the long run, additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately affect employment.
Peter Tsuoubalis, who has worked at the Barnston plant for 24 years and is the union representative at the plant, said there is growing concern among union members: "In my experience, if these jobs go, there will be no more applications.
A government spokesman said: "The government is putting forward a clear and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU".
"Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed". White House.
A high-level meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein may be postponed "for another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Agent Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump associates' ties to Russia, and the president's obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump's replacement of the Assistant Attorney General would affect Mora's independence has been attracting attention from around Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein attended a meeting with Trump wearing a recording device, suggesting that the president could be impeached under the 25th Amendment.
Mr. Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and according to the news, he was signaling his intention to resign.
In response, it was announced that the meeting with President Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
Although Trump said he "wouldn't want" Rosenstein's removal, the meeting with him was postponed after a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing coincided with the hearing. Both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blaze Ford, one of the women who has been accusing him of abuse, testified at the hearing.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
The president's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, was interviewed by Fox News on Saturday.
Asked about the meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, she replied: "The schedule is not finished yet, it could be this week. With everything else going on in the Supreme Court, I wouldn't mind a week's extension".
It's going to be clear in the future, and I always want to keep you updated with press releases".
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Mr. Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said she did not hate the TV reporters' stand-up because of the lack of briefings, but she also said: "I can't deny that they are stand-up".
The report suggests that Trump and the press will have more direct contact.
"President Trump has been asked more questions than any other president", he said, "but he has not provided any evidence to prove it".
The briefing will continue, but Sanders said, "If the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be absolutely better than asking me".
And we're doing a lot of work to make that happen, and you know we've been doing a lot of work over the last few weeks, and if we can get a chance to talk to the president of the United States, that's going to be a substitute for press briefings".
Trump is well-known for taking questions when he leaves the White House to attend a public reception or press conference.
However, a single press conference is rare.
The reason for this is evident from the president's character, which has been shown this week in New York to be free-spirited and sometimes uncharacteristically appear in front of a gathering of reporters.
A letter to the NHS Scotland, to EU workers worried about Brexit, to the healthcare workers.
The Minister for Health and Insurance has expressed his national gratitude to the EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland and his desire to remain in the same position after Brexit.
Six months before the UK leaves the EU, Jean Freema of MSP published a letter.
The Scottish Government has already promised to provide EU citizens working in government-developed public services with a service that is commensurate with the cost of applying for residency.
In his letter, Mr. Freeman wrote: "This summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the extension of the withdrawal period were ongoing, and are expected to conclude this fall.
But the British government is also considering and preparing for the possibility of a no-deal scenario.
I'm sure you're all very anxious at this time.
So, again, I want to tell you that I think the contributions of all our staff, regardless of nationality, are very valuable.
Our colleagues from the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and expertise to improve the functioning of health services, to contribute to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and I hope you will stay here.
Christian Abalcombe, head injury, emergency surgery to be performed.
Tennessee's linebacker Christian Abacrombie suffered a head injury and underwent emergency surgery after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, said the injury was reported just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline, and there he fell", says Mr. Reed.
The coach and medical staff administered oxygen aspiration on the sideline before putting the player on the cradle, and transported him on a stretcher for further examination.
Tennessee Press reported to WSMV's Chris Harris that the Avalanche player had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Harris added that "the details of the type/severity of the injury are not yet known". He said that the state of Tennessee is beginning an investigation into when the injury occurred.
This was the redshirt sophomore season for the Auburn Colonels, their first season in Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five total tackles and 18 total tackles in the season before being ejected from the game.
And the real estate market is the same.
Foreign buyers will pay higher stamp duty on UK property purchases. The proceeds will be used to help the homeless under the newly devised Tory Plan.
Mr. Corbyn has managed to win the youth vote, but this is expected to be a counter-movement.
The stamp duty increase is aimed at people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Inland Revenue Service expects to generate up to £120 million a year, which will be spent on homeless relief.
Prime Minister Theresa May today announced that foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on UK property purchases and that the proceeds will go towards helping the homeless.
Jeremy Corbyn has been successful in gaining the votes of young people, but this move is seen as an attempt to counter the power of the party by promising to tax high-income groups while increasing the provision of affordable housing.
Stamp duty is a tax levied on individuals and corporations that do not pay taxes in the UK. The revenue is used to strengthen the government's street-living measures.
The increase is in addition to the current stamp duty, and will be an increase of up to 3%. The increase was introduced two years ago for second homes and rental housing.
The Inland Revenue estimates that this will generate £120 million in revenue per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new properties in London are being bought by non-EU residents, which has driven up house prices and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to buy a home.
The affluent areas of the UK, especially the capital, have become ghost towns due to the increase in foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson proposed a stamp duty cut to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He has accused the construction giant of taking land to keep house prices high and urged Prime Minister May to remove the cap on the number of affordable homes in order to fix Britain's "housing problem".
Mr. Corbin announced a series of proposals that have garnered attention as housing reform, including a curb on rent and an end to the pursuit of "homelessness".
He also wants to give Congress stronger powers to build new housing.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year, I said that I would work to rebuild the British dream through my premiership.
It's also about fixing our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not a good situation for a non-British resident or a foreign company to be able to buy a house easily while a British resident works hard.
For many people who dream of owning a home, this is no longer a distant dream, and the dignity of the homeless remains a very real problem".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate dream is to be the manager of the Scotland team".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has spoken about his "ultimate dream" of one day managing the Scotland team.
The 42nd Scotland international is trying to revive the North East club, who are currently in third place in League One and three points clear of the top four.
He led St. Milan to the Scottish Premiership last season, and this summer he moved to the Stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play in my country as a player.
"I was very happy with the result, but I was disappointed with the result.
"As a child, I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hamden with my father, and that always drew me back.
"This is an opportunity that cannot be taken without the successful management of the club".
The previous managers of Sunderland have included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Arldais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kean, Gustavo Poze and Paolo Di Carnaro.
He is also the former head of Alora Athletic, and says he is not afraid to be associated with celebrities at such famous clubs. In the past, he has been refused transfer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success now depends on getting this club back to the Premier League.
"The club is a club that is not only a football club, but also a football club, because the organisation and facilities of this club are, without a doubt, the Premier League itself", he said.
"It's never easy to get there, but unless we get the club back there, we probably won't succeed".
Ross's manager experience is only three years, but he has 15 months of experience as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and on the coaching staff at Hertz.
He then led the team back from relegation to third place, and the following season he led St. Milan to the Championship title.
Ross says he is more relaxed now than he was when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was really a turning point in my life", she says of the time she received the halo.
"I was convinced that I was better at management than at playing.
I was doing well as an athlete, and this may sound strange, but I was earning some money, and I was getting some grades.
But playing is hard.
There are many things that have to be done every week.
And I think that's the same thing with stress and pressure, but I think management is good for you.
I've always wanted to be in management, and now I'm in it. I've never been so true to myself since I've grown up".
The interview is scheduled to air on Sunday, September 30th at 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Radio Scotland's Sports Sound.
Research has shown that the best time to drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The pubs in England are suffering from bankruptcy, but the summer heat has delayed sales, while for the restaurant chains this is an additional burden.
The survey found that sales in July were up 2.7% in pubs and 4.8% in restaurants.
Summing up the survey, business consultant Peter Martin of the CGA said: "After a strong day of sunshine and a longer than expected World Cup campaign for the UK, July was more like June than the previous month. The pub was up 2.8% and the restaurant was hit even more.
The restaurant business was down 1.8% in June, but it was even worse in July.
In comparison to the previous year, pubs and bars with drinks as their main product have done the best in the city. This is a larger decline than the restaurants.
The food industry is not as big a problem as the pubs, but it is suffering from the sun's intensity.
It seems that people are going out for a drink.
"The sales of drinks in the publicly owned pubs and bars were up 6.6% from the previous month, but the food sales were down 3%".
Paul Newman, a leisure hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and large social/sports events are factors that have a major impact on the sales of the catering industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant group continues to struggle financially, but it is particularly painful that sales fell by 4.8% compared to the same period last year, as cost pressures persist.
The prolonged summer heat has come at the worst possible time for the food-based business. Whether the easing of temperatures since the beginning of August will bring the expected relief remains to be seen".
Sales in all pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the brand's expansion.
Caffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 management groups. The chain has a combined turnover of £9 billion and is a prominent benchmarker in the industry.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.
One in five children, including children as young as 11, have hidden social media accounts from their parents or teachers, according to the survey.
The survey was conducted on 20,000 middle school students and found that fake Instagram pages are on the rise.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
20% of students are said to have a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children, including children as young as 11, have created social media accounts that hide their identity from adults.
The survey was conducted among 20,000 secondary school students and found that there was a surge in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
It is estimated that 20% of students have both a "main" account and a secret account that is used to show parents that they have removed unwanted content.
One mother accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, where she posted "rape others".
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Heads of Independent Schools Conference (HMC), found that 40% of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, one of which was a secret account.
Mike Buchman, the head of the HMC, said: "We are aware and appalled that many teenagers want to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
I'm a Scottish athlete, and I'm the voice of the athlete.
The Scottish Athletic Commission's general meeting elected the player, Ailey Doyle, as a non-executive director.
Mrs Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman Ian Beatty said the decision was a good opportunity for those involved in sport to draw on her experience of the past decade of extensive international experience.
"Ailey is held in great esteem by the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that her election to the committee will benefit the athletic community in Scotland greatly", he said.
Doyle said: "I want to work seriously to give athletes a voice. I want to help contribute to and promote Scottish sport".
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals, including the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Athens Olympics, and now appears regularly as a pundit on the BBC, suffered a stroke that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted: "One month ago today, I had a stroke.
I was unable to walk.
The doctor said he didn't know how long he would recover.
It's been a very hard road, but I've made a full recovery and I'm walking again.
Thank you for your encouraging message!"
The milk cow that made her mother look like a cow, the milk cow that made her mother look like a cow, the milk cow that made her mother look like a cow, the milk cow that made her mother look like a cow.
The manufacturer of the milk pumps has published an advertisement that depicts a mother with a milk cow being milked, and there are two opinions online.
The consumer technology company Elby released an advertisement inspired by a comical music video for the launch of the world's first silent wearable milk machine. The intention of the ad was to depict the liberation of breastfeeding mothers by this new milk machine.
Four real mothers dancing in a cowshed covered with tar, singing a song that includes the lyrics: "I'm milking myself, but there's no tail", "I may not have noticed, but it's not a cow's breast, it's my breast".
The chorus goes on to say: "By sucking, by sucking, by sucking, by sucking, I suckle the human female".
The advert, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
The video was viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments. Viewers reacted with both affirmative and negative reactions, many of whom said the ad exposed the dairy industry's "terror" in broad daylight.
"The use of dairy cows in advertising this product is a very bad decision.
"Like us, dairy cows need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in the case of cows, they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth", one post read.
The Elby milk machine fits snugly inside the breast-feeding bra.
Another comment stated: "Of course, this is traumatic for the mother and the baby.
How can we use a cow when a human mother can't have her baby taken away from her?"
One adds: "What an incredible ad!"
Some defend the ad, with one woman saying the song "laughed" at her.
"I think it was a brilliant idea.
I think I would have used it myself if I had still been breastfeeding.
I feel like a cow when I milk.
I'm pretty sure the ads are a little crazy.
Some people said, "This is a great product".
Another commented, "This is a fun ad for mothers who are breastfeeding and think they are cows".
It's not an ad that praises or criticizes the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the dancing women reveal that they had hidden the pumps in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is inspired by the fact that many women who breastfeed say they look like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is silent, without wires or tubes, and fits in a breast-feeding bra, so that women can move about freely, hold their babies, and even go outside while breast-feeding.
Mother's partner and ECD, Ana Ballarin, said: "The Elvie Pump is an innovative product, and I think it was a bold and provocative sales pitch.
The aim was to draw attention to the problems of breastfeeding and all its aspects, by comparing the female expression with that of the dairy cow, and to show in a funny way the surprisingly free feeling that the new breastfeeding brings.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has been the subject of a major cover story.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two who used this product appeared on the runway with designer Marta Jacbowski.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
While the number of people crossing the border in a month has remained relatively unchanged, the number of immigrant children in detention has increased dramatically, in part because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult to place children in foster care.
Until now, most of the guarantors were illegal immigrants themselves, and they feared that by filing for their children, they would jeopardize their own stay.
The risk was heightened when federal authorities announced in June that sponsors and other adults in their households would be required to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Alvens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified in Congress that he had arrested dozens of unaccompanied minors who had applied for bail.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are guarantors or members of guarantors' families are in the country illegally, most of them foreigners with criminal records.
"We are not going to be able to track down any of these individuals", Alvarez said.
To speed up processing of children's applications, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some people to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days after detention, according to camp workers.
Many of them will be appearing in person instead of via video call and will be filing legal status petitions with the Immigration Judge.
Those found to be unfit for redemption are immediately deported.
According to reports from camp workers and insiders over the past few months, prolonged detention makes children more likely to become anxious and depressed, and eventually violent or to attempt to escape.
Advocates said there was growing concern that the scale of large facilities such as Tornio was overlooking signs that children were facing difficulties.
Moving the child to a tent without adequate emotional preparation and time to say goodbye to friends, he added, could exacerbate the trauma he was already suffering.
Syria has ordered the US-Buddhist "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mullem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the country's civil war entering its eighth year.
Deputy Prime Minister Muallem said that foreign troops were illegally stationed on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will respond accordingly".
"We must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he said at the General Assembly.
The "war on terror" that has killed 360,000 people and driven millions from their homes since 2011 is "almost over", Muallem claimed.
Syria said it would continue this holy war "until we clear the entire territory of Syria of terrorist groups and "foreigners staying illegally".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and instruction of Syrian and Arab forces, mainly the Kurdish forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem accuses "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" of refugees to stay abroad, even though there is no problem with the conditions of return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to encourage the return", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposing forces reach a political agreement to end the war.
A UN diplomat says the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move the political dialogue forward.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaeda and "seeks to eliminate".
UN envoy Stéphane de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition parties, as soon as possible, to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and hold elections.
Muallem presented the Syrian government with the conditions to join the commission, saying the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected.
According to this logic, Trump would be reelected in 2020 unless he was impeached and scandalized early as president, as many liberal viewers probably would hope.
It will be the most dramatic presidential funeral ever.
So far, there's no sign of the audience getting tired.
Since 2014, the audience for Golden Hour has more than doubled from the 1.05 million viewers on CNN, and nearly tripled from the 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News' average viewership for its Golden Hour rose to 2.4 million from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" recorded the highest viewership of any cable channel in the nighttime news category at 3.5 million.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, and we can't understand it", says Neil Baer, the show's runner on ABC drama Survivor: The Fateful President, who stars as a cabinet minister who becomes president after the capital was destroyed by an attack.
Veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, Nell Scovel, has a different take.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
She asked why.
"The driver said, 'Because he makes you laugh,'" Scoville told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the storylines that come out of the American administration will determine whether the future of Rowe v. Wade, the reunification of immigrant families, the health of the world economy, and so on.
Ignoring is a luxury given only to the most privileged of spectators.
Yet, when we see a panel of experts discussing the use of "deep background" in Bob Woodward's book FEAR, Paul Manafort's $15,000 duckskin bomber jacket, and Stormy Daniels's elaborate account of Trump's anatomical impact, we are beyond the informed citizen.
Personally, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of what makes him feel like a reality show is that he's providing something every day", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about the cast of the Trump show and the script that unfolds during the day (he's talking about the fight with the NFL and praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode you've missed.
When I contacted Mr. Freis this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, and he was inside recording CNN and watching MSNBC.
He couldn't leave because Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"When we were doing these crazy shows, people used to say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Freis told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true".

External funding for the House of Representatives midterm elections, which are expected to be close.
It's no surprise that the redistricting of the House of Representatives has brought funding to Pennsylvania's 17th district, which has two incumbents vying for the same seat.
The newly redrawn district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Connor Lamm, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Mr. Lamb's challenger is Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is running in Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps significantly with the new 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old district was illegally in the Republican Party's favor, and the district was reorganized.
The campaign for the new 17th district has been a fierce battle with the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC), the major party's funding arm, and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) investing in the campaign.
Mr. Lamb, who drew attention in March when he narrowly won the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning by 20 points.
Political commentators say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States withdrew its sanctions against El Salvador after it considered a deal with China.
The diplomat pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized China, with little resistance from the United States.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 at a hotel in Panama until they withdrew the Trump campaign's operations team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to suspend recognition of Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the only country that was considered for sanctions and regulations was El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug addiction, development and economic assistance.
The penalties, including the reduction of financial aid and visa restrictions, have been painful for the Central American country, which suffers from high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal discussions progressed, North and Central American officials postponed high-level talks focused on security and economic development, following a similar meeting last year that was seen as a breakthrough in efforts to stem the flow of immigrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted to move forward with the meeting, and effectively ended consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the upcoming mid-October meeting of Congress on imports, which the government is seeking to discuss at the meeting, the diplomat said.
Three envoys returned from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in secret, without announcing any new harsh messages or sanctions from the United States.
A spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussions between the three senior US diplomats, two of whom agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity about the matter under internal review.
These accounts were confirmed by outside analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of the investigation
The next possible source of the investigation is a report by Robert Mueller, special counsel for Trump's potential obstruction of justice.
According to reports, Mueller is investigating whether Trump's campaign was in collusion with Russia, which targeted the US election.
If the Congress changes its balance of power, Trump will be held accountable to a majority of the political parties and even to a jury of lawmakers in preparation for his re-election campaign.
This does not mean that Trump or the European leader will necessarily lose their jobs, although there are many assumptions.
The choice must be made on both sides of the Atlantic as to how long the difficulty will last.
If the West would only resist Hitler and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich, the German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler in 1938.
And they failed, and they missed the chance to avoid the genocide that followed for years.
History has turned these turning points into borders, and the rigorous progress of democracy has been accelerated or hindered.
Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What would happen if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who is in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in trouble after the article, suggesting that he had secretly recorded the president last year, and speculating that the president was unfit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times article is inaccurate.
"How would you respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh was not complete or fair, or if the Supreme Court had approved him despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?"
More than that, will we vote in a midterm election that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But I think we'll learn a lesson from Prague.

Graham Dolanz of the Rangers, and Rapid Wien, confident of victory.
Rangers will play Rapid Wien at home on Thursday. They have a chance to break into Group G of the Europa League after a dramatic draw against Austria in Vizag earlier this month.
Midfielder Graham Drands was sidelined for the rest of the season with a knee injury that kept him out of the game until the 2-2 draw with Bijareal, but he believes Rangers can make a leap from that result.
"Visual Al is a good team, so it's good to get points", the 31-year-old said.
"We believed we could score at least one point by entering the game.
Maybe we got it right in the end, but overall, the draw is a fair result.
I think we had a good game in the first half, but we showed our strength in the second half and won the game.
Thursday night, the big game in the Europa League.
I hope I can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because the other team had a good result in the previous match. However, I believe that with the support of the fans, I can try hard and get a good result.
Last year was definitely a tough year, with injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel comfortable.
The team is good, the teammates are having a great time, the training is great.
From now on, I'll try to forget about last season and try to be successful.
And the reason why women are so afraid of retirement savings is because they don't sleep enough.
Despite the fact that the respondents have a clear idea of what kind of care they want, few people talk about their families and their care.
In a national survey, about half of the respondents said they talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them talk to their kids about it.
"People want to take care of their families, but they're not actually having the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
And then we'll show you how to start a conversation.
Talk to your spouse and children. Unless you make your wishes known in advance, your family cannot prepare to care for you.

The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking witnesses to come forward.
Earthquake and Tsunami in India
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palem on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications were disrupted and rescue officials were unable to obtain information from the Donggala district in the northern part of Par near the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Pal, 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Next, we will show you the main facts about Par and Dongala on Sulawesi Island.
Pal is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, on the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongara is a prefecture of Sulawesi, stretching over 300 km along the coastline of the northwestern part of the island.
The province is smaller than the state and has an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but is mostly concentrated in the coastal town of Moroni on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Pal and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami, and hundreds of homes were destroyed in Dongola.
Donggala West was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently.
On 26 December 2004, a major earthquake struck the western coast of Aceh, in the northern part of Sumatra, Indonesia, and a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A strong earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Sunya off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern most populous island of Java, Indonesia, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padan, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the epicenter of the earthquake in Pidi Jaya province, Aceh, caused devastating damage, and people panicked as they remembered the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but the collapse of the building killed more than 100 people.
2018: A large earthquake struck the Indonesian resort island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and many tourists were temporarily displaced by the earthquake.
Sarah Paylin's oldest son was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Truck Palin, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Police on Saturday, 29-year-old Wasilla Palin of Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he took the woman's phone when her acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
KTUU says Pailin is being remanded to the Matzo Pre-Trial Facility, with a $500 bond.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and claimed to be "of course not guilty" in his defense.
Palin could be charged with three Class A misdemeanors, up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is the equivalent of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that Palin has been the subject of a criminal case.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged assault to the police.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence crime report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with this incident.
He claimed his girlfriend had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for linking her son's violence to PSTD caused by his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake tsunami
On Friday, an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing 384 people.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the future.
The earthquake occurred in Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video of the shock moment has been circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were at the beach festival in Perth when the tsunami swept in.
The FBI is seeking a rare death sentence for a New York City terrorist suspect.
The New York City Police Department is seeking the death penalty for Syphilo Sykopov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attacks that killed eight people. This is a very rare federal crime that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saypoff, 30, used a rented truck from a home depot to attack pedestrians and cyclists in a bicycle lane along the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, indiscriminately.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Shapov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to a death notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, assault, and destruction of a motor vehicle for threatening acts, which federal prosecutors commonly use in organized crime trials.
The prosecutor said that the attack required "adequate planning and forethought", and called the actions of Saipov "heinous, cruel and despicable".
The notice of intent states that "Saifrow Habiliaevik, Saifov, Diego Enrique Angeliini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anrol Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Elridge, Arnan Feruch, Arnan Diego Mendoza, Alejandro Damian Panguinco were injured and the loss was for their family and friends".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death sentence in the Southern District of New York was 10 years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers and sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 when the couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, had not shown remorse for days or months after the attack.
He said he had no regrets about going to the agents, the police said.
In the indictment, Saypov told authorities that he had seen ISIS videos on his cell phone and thought of the attack.
The police also announced that they had asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in the hospital ward.
He also pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of murder.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors defending Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We will not accept a guilty plea to life without the possibility of parole, and we believe that seeking the death penalty will only prolong the trauma of such events for all concerned", said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative MP has said that the UK's negotiations with the EU are a good fit for Nigel Farage.
Nigel Farage declared that he would "mobilize the people's army" during a protest against the Conservative Party conference today.
The former leader of the UKIP, Theresa May, needed to feel the "pressure" of the Eurosceptics when one of her party members said that he was fit to negotiate with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bown said that if Mr Farage had been the EU's Brexit secretary, Britain would have "already left" by now.
But the problem that May faced in reconciling with the divided MP was that the Tory Remainers had joined the city's anti-Brexit protests.
The Prime Minister has found it difficult to maintain the Chequers plan, amidst the backlash from the EU, the Leave Party, the Remain Party and the Chequers compromise.
May's supporters claimed that she had tried to negotiate a deal with the EU against her will, and had forced Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her compromise and "disruption".
Mr. Bourne said at the Solor's "Breaking out is quitting" rally that he wanted to "give up the Chequers".
He said that Mr. Farage should be considered a pro-European and should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
"If he was in charge, we would have already left".
The Welshborough MP said: "I support leaving the EU, but the Chequers should be stopped".
He objected to the EU, saying, "We cannot be subjected to a world war.
We want to have our own laws in this country.
Mr Boehn said the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote was "not true at all" and that "the British people want to reconsider staying in".
Conservative MEP Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the rally, told reporters: "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers are unpopular with the public, the opposition doesn't vote, and the activists in the party who actually went around the street and brought the election victory are unpopular in the first place.
I want the Checkers to withdraw and to hear their opinions".
In a message to May, he said: "The Prime Minister can remain in office when he has kept his promises".
Farage said that politicians who attended the rally would "feel the pressure" if they were to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and the political class", he said.
"They are betraying the EU, and we are now saying, 'We cannot accept that.'"
He told the enthusiastic audience: "I want you to feel the pressure of the political class who are trying to betray the EU.
"We will not rest until we have mobilized the people's forces in this country who led the victorious way out of the EU and become a proud Britain, independent and self-sufficient".
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham, holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's launch this week, the unruly activists raised the banner of the Conservative Party against leaving the EU.
Baron Adonis of the Labour Party ridiculed the Conservatives over a security issue that was the party's app at the start of the contest.
They are the ones who said that they could bring in the IT system and all the other technologies to make it possible to have a smooth border crossing and a borderless free trade in Ireland".
"It's a total sham.
There is no such thing as a favourable exit from the EU".
Mr. Warren is preparing for his presidential campaign.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "thoroughly preparing for the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the future Saturday during a Western Massachusetts dialogue rally.
A frequent critic of President Donald Trump, Warren is seeking re-election in November to run against Republican Jeff Deal, who served as Trump's vice chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's getting attention for challenging Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was Trump's 36th presidential debate with his constituents.
One participant asked if she would run for president.
Warren said it was time for "women to reach out to the White House and fix the broken government", and that included a woman president.
Simms, Louisiana State University, arrested in connection with the shooting.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Deaton Simpson, 20, on the news at 11 a.m.
Police released video of the shooting on Friday, asking for information that could help identify the man in the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed early Friday morning on the campus of Southern University.
According to 247 Sports, "Wade Simms died from a gunshot wound to the head", Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media on Saturday.
Wade was shot by Simpson as he tried to protect his friend.
Simpson admitted to the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon, that he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Station.
Sims, a 198-pound junior from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 as a starter, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Team Order: Lewis Hamilton wins against Sebastian Vettel and is close to winning the title
The moment that Baltar Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying on Saturday, it became clear that the order of the Mercedes team plays a big part in the race.
Bottas, who had started well from pole position, held the lead in the first two laps, and was on the verge of putting Betts in a playoff race against Hamilton, eliminating Hamilton's chances of winning.
Vettel was the first to pit and Hamilton was the first to catch up with the team that was late, which usually decides the race.
Hamilton, in the Mercedes, pitched in after one lap, but was behind Bettel, and in the third corner, Bettel, in the Ferrari, prevented two overtakes, but was able to take the lead by attacking the empty interior.
Max Berlstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh on the first lap.
He then reduced his time, and kept his position for most of the race without changing his tires to overtake the fourth-placed Raikkonen.
In the end, he pitched on the 44th lap, but could not pick up the pace on the remaining eight laps, and the racer was fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Bartelli had been so kind to let me go first all weekend.
"The team did a great job with one, two finishes", Hamilton said.
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
President Donald Trump, in a rally on Saturday, ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein's claim that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a rally in West Virginia, did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the events in the Senate showed that people were "despicable, malicious and lying".
"One of the great things that can happen in the Senate, and has happened in the last few days, is that I have seen anger, and I have seen people who are angry, and I have seen people who are mean, and mean, and mean, and liars", he said.
"I've seen releases and leaks, and I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it".
You remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the data?
You remembered her answer and leaked the documents?
No, I did not.
It didn't leak".
Just a minute.
"We leaked, no, we didn't leak", the senator added with a smile.
Mr. Feinstein received a letter from Mr. Ford in July detailing the allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh, which was leaked in early September, but Mr. Feinstein denied that the leak was from the office.
"We're not hiding the allegations of Dr. Ford, and we're not leaking them", Feinstein told the committee, the Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it".
But she denied that she had been in touch with the president, who had commented at the Saturday night rally: "I think it was too much body language.
"Maybe she didn't know it, but that was the worst body-length I've ever seen".
He further defended the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of committing sexual misconduct with three women. The president said the Democratic Party was using suspicion for its own purposes.
"They are determined to use any means necessary".
"We will see the meanness, the malice, the hurt, the kicking of the people to gain power and dominate", Mediaite reported the president's comments.

Patrick Dwyer of the Giants scores two goals against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars won the Dundee snow-shaming match 5-3 on Saturday, and made up for their defeat against the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead with goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier.
The home team tied the game with goals from Mike Sullivan and John Cooney, but the Giants took the lead again with a Dwyer goal.
François Bouchard equalised with a goal from Dundee, and Lucas Randbald Nielson won with two goals from the penalty spot.
Adam Keefe's team, who beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night, have suffered their third defeat of the season in the Elite League.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, but the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal with a Kendall McFaul assist at 3:35 of the fourth minute, and four minutes later, a David Rutherford assist gave Bouvier a two-goal lead.
In the first period of the fierce attack, the home team Sullivan returned the point at 13 minutes and 10 seconds, and at 15 minutes and 16 seconds Cooney equalised.
Dwyer scored the second goal of the night before the end of the first period, and the Giants took the lead to end the period.
The home team rebounded, and Bushard again tied the game at 27 minutes and 37 seconds from the power play.
In the second period, a goal from the consortium of Cooney and Charles Corcoran was scored by Nielsen, and Dundee took the lead for the first time in the match, and scored the team's fifth point in the middle of the final period to decide the victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
The air traffic controllers saw the plane with hundreds of people on board take off when the earthquake hit, and they were killed.
Indonesian air traffic controllers are being hailed as heroes after hundreds of people were killed in a plane that was flying at full capacity.
A major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the region, with many trapped in the city of Pal.
As his colleagues escaped, 21-year-old António Gunawan completed his mission without running away in the violently shaking control tower of the Mutiala Siss Al Jowri Airport.
He stayed until he saw the Baltic Air Flight 6321 take off safely, which was on the runway at the time of the earthquake.
Then, thinking the control tower was collapsing, I jumped.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Seurat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
A helicopter was arranged to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived.
"We are heartbroken by this news", he added.
However, officials feared the death toll could reach 1,000, and the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the dongola, the shigi and the buton was restricted.
"Many people are still under the rubble and cannot be rescued, so the number of dead and wounded is expected to rise", said the spokesman of the authorities, Stopo Nugroho.
A tsunami of up to 6 meters has devastated Pal, where a mass burial is scheduled for Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying relief supplies and essential goods.
Lisa Kusma, 35, the mother of the child, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is carrying a dead body.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Every mini market is being looted".
Jan Gerfand, the president of the International Red Cross Society of Indonesia, told CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors as quickly as possible, but what do you think about this place?
This is already a tragic situation and it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Perak on Sunday and told the military: "I want you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has suffered more than 550 deaths in the earthquake in Lombok earlier this year.
Air Niugini says plane crashed on a coral reef, one person missing
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific reef off Micronesia said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane, but that one man was missing.
Air New Guinea reported that one of its passengers, a male, was missing as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for passenger details, such as age and nationality.
The other passengers and crew of the plane, which crashed into the sea while attempting to land at Chuk Island airport, were rescued by a local boat.
Authorities said seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers remained in the hospital, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events remain unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy have announced that the plane crashed into a reef off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
Bill Gaines, an American passenger, said the plane had crashed in low-altitude.
"It was very good", Mr. Gaines said.
Mr. Gaines said that he and others had walked to the emergency exit of a plane that was about to sink in waist-deep water.
He said the cabin crew screamed in panic and said he had a slight injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy announced that the crew that was doing the head-over-head refurbishment also used inflatable boats to turn the people back to shore and joined the rescue before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in the last 20 years in the crash of a PNG airline, but Air Niugini was not involved.
Analysts describe a series of nights in which women were burned alive.
Prosecutors gave their final statement Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a living Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Lawlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a reference in the field of intelligence analysis.
He used cell phone records to trace the movements of the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, and the 29-year-old defendant, Kinton Therese, on the day of her death.
Mr. Lawlett said that he had received some cell phone location data indicating that Chambers had been with Terris the night of his death, which contradicted Terris' previous testimony, the Clarion Register reported.
The police went to question him because the cell phone data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford testified on the stand that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked whether it was true that Teller had been in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford testified that "his truck was in Nashville, so what he said is a lie".
It also contradicts the statement that Telis had been with him for about two weeks when Chambers died.
According to his phone records, we've only known each other for a week.
Mr. Lauer said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' text, call, and contact information from his phone.
"He has erased her from his life", said Mr. Hale.
The accused is scheduled to begin his final defense on Sunday.
The judge said later that day that the trial would be moved to the jury's verdict.
The High Breed: What is rational hip-hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists who are trying to challenge the negative image of the genre by putting a positive message into their music.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip hop has moved away from its original political message and its commitment to social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and bring back the old hip-hop.
Artists like Hoogeez and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Acalan and Rocky.
Are you black again?
A New York babysitter is suing a couple who fired her after a "racist" text.
A New York babysitter is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after her mother sent her a wrong message and received a text complaining about her that said, "There's a black guy again".
The couple denied that the lawsuit was racist, calling it "an act of coercion".
Lindsey Plasco-Fruxman, a mother of two, expressed her confusion at the arrival of her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, as a black woman on her first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, black again", Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
But the text was not from her husband, but from Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to the New York Post, after noticing the misbehaviour, Placo-Flaxman, who had quit as an African-American babysitter in the past, said she was expecting Filipinos instead because of the poor quality of her work, and fired Morris.
Mr. Morris got a day's pay and was taken home in an Uber.
This time, Maurice sued the couple for the cost of the firing, claiming $350 a day and six months' worth of compensation for the original planned overcrowding, despite no contract.
"I want to tell them, you shouldn't do this", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple denied the accusations of being racist and argued that the firing was justified because they were afraid of not being able to trust her after making her feel uncomfortable.
"My wife sent her a text, but it didn't mean anything.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But, even if it were a mistake, could you leave your child with someone who was rude to you?
Your newborn baby?
I can't do that".
To qualify the lawsuit as "compelling", Plasco said that his wife had been in labor for only two weeks and that it was "a very difficult situation".
"How can you do this to someone in such a difficult situation?"
That's not very good", the investment banker added.
As the legal proceedings progress, the courtroom's public opinion is rapidly spreading, the couple is being accused on social media, and their actions and logic are being challenged.
Paddington Publishers, a new letter reveals that the talking bear was feared by readers who were not willing to accept it.
Shortly after the book was accepted, Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine how someone would feel if they read it for the first time before it was published.
And now, what we know about Paddington is that it's a huge success. It's very interesting".
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, would have been optimistic if he hadn't been offered the job, and that the publication of his 60th posthumous anniversary last year was "Bittersweet".
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family", adding that he was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very quiet man", she said, "not one to brag".
"But Paddington was very real to him, as if he had a sense of pride when his child had accomplished something, even though he had done nothing in particular.
I think that's how my father saw Paddington's success.
It was his creation and imagination, but he always praised Paddington himself".
My daughter was on her deathbed, and she had to say goodbye over the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was evacuated to the hospital Louis Pasteur II in Nice, where she was treated by doctors who were not very pleased with her condition.
"She was in very serious condition, and Nadou called several times to tell her that she could not be saved", said Ednan Laperrez.
"And Nad called and said that she would die in two minutes and that she had to say goodbye".
And then I told him.
And I said, "Oh, my darling, I love you so much".
I'll be right with you.
I'll be right there.
The medicine the doctor gave her to stop her heart from beating slowly stopped her movement.
She was already dead, and all this was stopped.
I just sat there and waited and knew what was happening.
I was surrounded by so many family members and people that I couldn't even shake my head or scream or cry.
I had to endure it".
In the midst of his grief over the loss of his daughter, Mr. Ednan Lapelouze was soon forced to board a plane with other passengers and endure the situation.
"I didn't know anybody", she said.
"I was crying with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was on this flight that I felt this unbearable sadness for Nado.
All he needed was my love and understanding.
He really loved her".
Women in grief are putting up cards on the bridge to prevent suicide.
We work to prevent the attempts of two women who have lost loved ones to suicide from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys continue to hold up cards with heartfelt messages and phone numbers for support above the Welsh Bridge.
Mr. Davis' son, Tyler, suffered from depression at the age of 13, and at the age of 18, he took his own life.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Ridney, said her son was a smiling chef with a great future.
"Everyone knew his smile.
"He was a great man, and people said his smile would light up any room".
But he was in a "really dark place" and he had given up his job before he died.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, discovered the death of his brother.
Davis said, "I'm worried about a chain of events".
Ms. Davis made a card: "Even if you're a friend, I want people to know that you have someone to go and talk to.
Do not be silent, speak up".
Humphries, a longtime friend of Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say anything about being depressed or depressed", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was very depressed on Christmas Day -- he didn't even look at the kids or do anything when they opened their presents".
She said that his death was a great trauma for the children, but that they had to overcome it. "It tore the family apart.
And he tore it apart.
But we all have to fight for it".

The FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's future has made it unpredictable.
"In a limited time and scope of investigation, if we could actually get what he wanted, I thought we could be a little bit more cohesive", Flake said, adding that Saturday he was concerned that the committee had "scattered" amidst a paralyzing partisan mood.
Why were Mr. Kavner and his Republican supporters so unwilling to be investigated by the FBI?
Their hesitation is all a matter of timing.
The midterm elections are coming up five weeks from now, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans are out of their minds, they will be very weak in choosing the person they want to elect to the Supreme Court of the United States.
George W. Bush called Senators in droves to urge them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and his wife, Ashley, who worked as Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares that report?
Voting begins in the Senate, which is composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains to be seen whether Cabano will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would see Vice President Mike Pence break the caucus and have him confirmed by the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees decline under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byung-seok, citing data from the Korean Unification Ministry, said that last year there were 1,127 defectors, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Pak said that the main reasons for this were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates for smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean exiles are gradually granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many of them are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easily overrun by the heavily guarded DMZ, the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China often deported and treated as illegal immigrants rather than refugees.
In fact, the North-South relationship, which is still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This was done after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un agreed to move towards denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula at a historic meeting in Singapore in June.
But on Sunday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho denounced the US sanctions, which have since been unable to make progress.
"Without trust in the United States, without confidence in our national security, we cannot under these circumstances unilaterally move towards denuclearisation", Mr. Li said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi said Brett Kavanaugh was "hysterical" and "unsuitable for the Supreme Court".
House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for a Supreme Court appointment.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Sunday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I cannot help but think that if a woman had behaved in such a manner, she would have been described as 'hysterical.'" Pelosi spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Cabanero's testimony.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blazy Ford's allegations that the two had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.
During his opening statements, Cabanere was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting or stuttering during his family and high school debates.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "an odd and coordinated smear" by liberals who were outraged by Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he was convinced that Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because of his bias against the Democrats.
"He is unfit for these statements and for the manner in which he has treated Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was asked if he would impeach Cabanò if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's just say that if he hasn't told the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's ineligible not only to the Supreme Court, but to the court that he's in right now", Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Superior Court.
Pelosi, a Democrat, is concerned that he will be a conservative trial, and that Cabanova will have a controlling influence over health care reform and the Roe v. Wade case.
At his confirmation hearing, Cabano avoided being asked whether he intended to overturn a particular Supreme Court decision.
"It's not the stage where a hysterical, prejudiced person goes to court and says, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It is a justified, violent rebuke, the seething fury of months and years, which she cannot get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mr. Steinem told me 45 years later.
And I said, "I don't think that's unusual, but what do you think?"
She continued, "I've been helped by a woman who has an executive somewhere, and she cries when she's angry, and when she's angry and she starts crying, she develops a technique to say to her interlocutor, 'I think I'm crying because I'm sad.'
I'm mad at you".
And she just kept crying.
And I thought it was so great".
Tears are not understood, and are considered to be a part of anger.
One of my most vivid memories of my old job, in a male-dominated office, is when I was crying in an unspeakable rage, and the cold, elderly woman who had been a little afraid of me all day had dragged me down the stairs by the collar.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to see you down".
I was a member of the Colorado Democratic Party, and I was campaigning for the candidacy of Patricia Schrader and Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Ms. Hart withdrew from the race after discovering an affair called Monkey Business, Ms. Schrader was deeply saddened that she had no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing we needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
She said she would not run for president because it was too late to start her campaign, and she had not enough funding, and she vowed she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
I found out that some of her supporters, including men, offered her $1,000, but she was only offered $250.
"Do they think I've been discounted?" she lamented.
When she gave a speech to officially announce the launch of her campaign, she was overwhelmed by a range of emotions: gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the way the system was so difficult to raise funds, and to target voters instead of representatives, and anger at the disregard for women.
"You must have thought my nerves were weak". Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press had contacted her.
"I thought you thought Clinix was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what words would be written on my tombstone.
"The weeping woman"?
The benefits to Beijing from the U.S.-China trade war.
Experts say that while the trade war between the US and China has started with a one-off attack and is far from over, the rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump earlier this year issued a warning by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest tariff advance this week will affect the equivalent of 200 billion pounds, in fact, half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way, recently imposing 5 to 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion of American products.
China has vowed to stand up to the United States, and the world's second largest economy is not about to back down.
To yield to Washington is to surrender, but to openly submit to the United States is a great humiliation for China's supreme leader Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of economic chaos in both countries is more dangerous than observers previously thought", said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Center for a New American Security, a think tank focused on Asia.
The Syrian Foreign Minister, ready for the return of refugees.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by seven years of war.
According to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alim said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, thanks to the progress of the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and more secure", he said.
The government is restoring areas destroyed by terrorists to normalcy.
All of these situations are now being created for refugees who have been forced to flee their homes because of terrorism, because of economic measures that are biased against their daily life and livelihoods, and who are returning to their countries of origin voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the collapsed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional support from countries that sponsor civil unrest.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National outside Paris, France, beating the United States team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States is currently on a six-game losing streak in Europe, and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe, under the leadership of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States and reclaim the crown.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been on the bench for most of the tournament, had a tee shot into the pool on the 16th hole of the third par and conceded his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Morinari has been shining in all of his rounds and is one of four players to have reached 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
Jordan Spies of the United States lost to the lowest ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Torbjon Olsen, 5-4
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who would have played in the Ryder Cup final.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain was the tournament's leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very difficult year.
So I'm grateful that Thomas chose me to believe in him.
I'm very happy. I'm very happy to have my cup back.
This is a team, and I'm very happy to be able to contribute".
He gave the baton to his home-town teammate, John Lamb, who beat Tiger Woods, the American golfing legend, 2-1 in Sunday's singles.
"It's an incredible feeling to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said the 23-year-old Lamb.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and posted a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The only other statistic that is odd is that one of the greatest players to ever win 14 major titles is Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had been playing at a high level during the tournament, the U.S. team struggled to find a fairway during the weekend.
American captain Jim Frouk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the team. They fought.
This morning, we discussed Europe.
We had a fight.
I'd like to thank Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played well.
We will be re-teaming and working with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You must not drop your hat.
We were defeated".
Red tide is coming in. The levels are down in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that the average red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area is decreasing.
According to the FWC, patch color conditions have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlottes, and Collier populations, indicating a decrease in intensity.
The red tide extends roughly 130 miles from the northern Pinellas County coast to the southern Lee County coast.
The patch can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but has been seen in fewer locations compared to last week.
Red tides have been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate concentrations were reported in Pinellas County and off its coast, low to high concentrations were reported off the coast of Hillsboro County, high concentrations were reported from elements in Manatee County, high concentrations were reported from elements in Sarasota County and off its coast, moderate to moderate concentrations were reported from elements in Charlotte County, high concentrations were reported from elements in Lee County and off its coast, and low concentrations were reported in Collier County.
There are reports of respiratory tract infections in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Colera counties.
No respiratory infections have been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
