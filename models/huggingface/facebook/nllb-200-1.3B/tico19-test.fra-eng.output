Rapid increase in cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
From Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to prepare for a spike in COVID-19 patients requiring care, particularly intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the causative agent as a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develops a severe form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with those in Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the 5 March edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities of different countries and WHO, daily at 08:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trend in the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases within EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February before experiencing a sharp increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, as of 15 March at 08:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions as well as differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reports said that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, systematic collection is needed to complement the current surveillance data which focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 201011 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100 000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100 000 inhabitants in 2010).11
Modelling scenarios for care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk of over 90% capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM COVID-19 rapid risk assessment.
Since cases have been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally accommodate a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, particularly intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent CEPCM Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in cases may not leave enough time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible, and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this burgeoning research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who were forced to stay indoors for the entire golden week and for many more weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease is called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan and quickly spread throughout China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO says COVID-19 is the number one public enemy, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 showing the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to summarise the progress of research on this new and growing topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also review what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronavirus are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens to humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century, we have seen two highly pathogenic coronavirus for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is thus the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1, pneumonia outbreaks of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was quarantined with all public transportation disrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spreading in homes, mainly in Hubei Province and the surrounding area.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean time between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass displacement that occurred before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality in patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing single strand RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequence samples taken from the outbreak site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human LACE2 has been identified as a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by lorf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by lorf8.
SARS-CoV-2 Lorf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit expression of lIFNβ; however, lorf8 does not contain known functional domains or patterns.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. presented the cryo-ME structure of complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had both open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing clues for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to the two bat-type SARS coronaviruses known as bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji et al. hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would involve homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-nosed, ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99 percent genetic homology between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% between two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is, in general, lacking in immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (MRTs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
By various means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells.
The T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support the defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, to multi-system failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is generally accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is compromised are at higher risk of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) from a demographic of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine to follow a as precise incubation period as possible, in order to prevent the transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic persons.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected by, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and those with acute fever, even without abnormalities on chest X-rays, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98 percent fever, 76 percent dry cough, 55 percent dyspnea and 3 percent diarrhea; 8 percent of patients required ventilation assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family and a household that developed from transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80 per cent required ventilation assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, consistent with a higher mortality rate from MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
For SARS, the main symptoms were found to be fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%) dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilation assistance was required in approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the mortality rate from COVID-19 was 2%, with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8 096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% for 2 494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table Table1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks before symptoms began.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients can carry the virus again, which highlights the need to increase the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or reduced peripheral white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a 4 × 109/L white blood cell count and a 1 × 109/L lymphocyte count, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, were high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are seen in most COVID-19 patients, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or opacity of the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most alarming chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multi-nucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 lRNA via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the outbreak, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer solely based on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's team described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows for the identification of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a reactive tape in less than an hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if it is used in clinical specimens.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can only provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working on developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other ACE2 expressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMOC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive immune system reaction has been shown to cause cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-cell failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, particularly for severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shock include T cell modulation of the immune response, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine signaling suppressor 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressant agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroid use did not have beneficial effects on severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroid cycles has been recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir has also been shown to potentially inhibit other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead has transferred the compound to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other undesirable effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancient practice.
This is because recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in association with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until a specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause an over-stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is high.
It's difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to look for antibodies that are effective against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow rapidly increasing the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, made according to the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain little or not at all known as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission from a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best COVID-19 recovery rates were seen in provinces in China that used TCM for 87 per cent of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7 per cent), Ningxia Region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while Hubei Province, which used TCM for only 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine (WM) alone and a combination treatment combining WM and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptom aggravation (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM have yet to be determined through controlled trials at a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a strong concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those in quarantine also experience feelings of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS outbreak, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt for patients about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected reservoirs of animals and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines, with the aim of producing long-term potent neutralizing antibodies and/or inducing protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly and lethally provoked models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection is yet to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably because SARS died out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunised individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing outbreak.
However, this is a real challenge due to the long time (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without any side effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognostic model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
From clinical studies conducted to date, factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table (Table33):
Age: age was the main factor in the prognosis of SARS, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years of age according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to lACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to treatment and cure.
The correlation between CRP rate and severity and the prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released in tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and the time progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with other factors for determining the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
As high-dose corticosteroid use has been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid administration to COVID-19 patients should be limited to a low dose and for a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
From the demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and causes no or few symptoms in the first phase of infection, like the coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, individuals who have recently been infected or are in the incubation period may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by critically ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently underway in China, including the containment of Wuhan and nearby cities, as well as the continuous quarantine of nearly the entire population in order to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the outbreak will end in March and that the decline phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be eradicated by 2020.
Ira Longini et al. developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mean nasal cornea and throat samples of recovered patients 2 weeks after discharge from hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a cyclical episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented may have worked.
Initial estimates put the Ebola virus at up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or that it may evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and also possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in feces, revealing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients with pre-existing illnesses and 40 healthcare professionals.
Precautions should be taken to protect individuals, including healthcare professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent potentially infected droplets from projecting or depositing on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (1860) provide protection against inhalation of 10 to 80 nm viruses, with only 5% of the viruses able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, as both are about 85 nm in length.
Since particles can pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear fitted isolation jackets to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective eyewear when in contact with patients.
For people in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, to remain confined as much as possible and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre from the sick.
These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must have placed China on high alert following the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Center reassured the public that the new virus was not contagious, had limited human-to-human transmission, and would not be difficult to prevent and contain.
This message led to a notable slackening, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as every word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential outbreak in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases among the population, as well as regularly testing and improving society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing, it has spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak is a foregone conclusion.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the outbreak and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, whereas SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This is partly why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical questions remain unanswered, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96 percent genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originated from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the virus to be transmitted from the original host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the outbreak can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 expressing cells from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or an effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all these questions and many others.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as quickly as possible and return to the normal course of our lives.
The incubation period of both viruses is usually less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunosuppressed patients have had severe lower respiratory tract infections.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong province in China.
Excluding super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could generate approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with peak viral load occurring on day 10 of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, coughing and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, incorrect liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests for suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory illnesses.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community-acquired HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportions to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
In this context, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the larger the number of infected people, the greater the chances that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
However, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it is useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host for an HCoV if it has a close ancestor that shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host harbors HCoV continuously and long-term.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as amplifier intermediate hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Lhuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate relative of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Therefore, bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive to specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, as are camels from the Middle East in several countries in Africa.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through feces, which is also the main route of excretion for bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than that separating SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs from pangolins.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may both be from bat CoV, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camellids have also been suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock in the 1890s, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs close to HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpacas, humans can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
But humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are abundant and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas the alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary animals for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels which have gone from intermediate hosts to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike camels' role in MERS-CoV transmission, pangolins' role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through slashing or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the cutting and eating of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research into the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single strand RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be considered  moderate  to  high  with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2's mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
We can assume that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs change patterns randomly and frequently during lRNA replication through a unique copy-choice  mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal CoVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors listed above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during episodes of inter-species transmission.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S means that the binding affinity of this S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10 to 20 times higher affinity of this linkage than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reservoirs of HCoVs.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but coded for different ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV outbreak has been shown to have episodes of recombination between different strains, which occurred in dromedary animals in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be seen in HCoV-229E-associated bat and camel viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RDO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect the "re-rection" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoVs may also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their tank hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets lie of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local people.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to slaughter all camels to control MERS as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
The consumption of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity arises for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses seen in their natural hosts should be identified.
Respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to reduce the number of children who die during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main causes of death among children under five, is the leading cause of death, claiming nearly 1.8 million victims each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor harmful effect is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis of the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
The two-year annual deworming, combined with daily handwashing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste, is at the heart of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase the solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter from the soil, are difficult to dissolve in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin-protective surfactant, more complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as special triclosan-containing antibacterial soaps in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a water-free hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to produce a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to produce a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively kill germs.
Water-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Water-alcohol solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the main cause of gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or water-alcohol solution should be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have soap and water at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to drying of the skin if the formula is not strengthened by emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
Non-aqueous products, while effective, do not remove organic matter from hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is attenuated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with running water, whether warm or cold.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Spray plenty of soap on the hands by rubbing them together, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Washing in a stagnant water basin may lead to re-contamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to re-contaminate. The areas most often overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the under nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin promotes the development of skin lesions which may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a suspended and perforated can or canister and/or using ash if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a matter of debate.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in a hot air hand dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the finger pulp and by 254% on the palms.
Air-dried hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After drying of the hands, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
The hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to moisten and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other, passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water from the forearms should not leak to the hands.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing hand washing frequency beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find handwashing faucets near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building handwashing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of hand hygiene campaigns to reduce childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that claims to encourage behavioural change. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, signs illustrating  good hand-washing techniques  have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be complicit in something.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of purification, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after each meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the genomes of viruses, which are most likely due to selection pressures, including those of the host immune system.
For example, complete ORF4 loss in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be seen in HCoV-229E-associated bat and camel viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitor receptor and by the low rate of expression of the major class I histological complex molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RDO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect the "re-rection" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoVs may also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their tank hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets lie of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in the market have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by humans, either intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing fresh produce markets and slaughtering civets in them could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
In the same vein, pangolins should be withdrawn from fresh produce markets to prevent the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV strains of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local people.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to slaughter all camels to control MERS as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
There are plenty of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future.
The consumption of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity arises for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics that favour the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimised if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
The zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses seen in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 is needed.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Rapid Recommendation Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this guideline described our experience and provided references for fighting this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new, and our knowledge and knowledge is gradually advancing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a suspected case and confirmed case according to the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
To help fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge and knowledge is gradually progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, with some contexts substantially modified.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., who submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must either combine one of the characteristic elements of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious SARS-CoV-2 cases (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City or surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 weeks with fever/respiratory symptoms in the home, in the classroom, in the office, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity to newly known coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or change of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increase of the titer ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic testing of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the specific antibody positive result to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence to warn us to be cautious about atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people without clinical symptoms as  low risk .
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
Finally, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to provide their comments.
As regards the diagnosis of  suspected cases  and  confirmed cases , we suggest that they follow and abide by the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, a record daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in one day.
The country has thus recorded a record number of deaths due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected persons recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still allowed.
On 19 March, all three had recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city lockdown until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one abstention.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal an HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying animal host-CoV interactions could also provide a better understanding of human CoV.
According to the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV).The Beta-CoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of species crossing the barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host (s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow into WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both found worldwide and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in countries with a temperate climate.
Stores in Australia reduce the amount of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on buying toilet paper to two and one pack per purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These limits were posted in the form of messages to the cashiers and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Shoppers were apparently stockpiling for fear of COVID-19 and the need to quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous four-pack per purchase restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, said that with the four-pack restriction in place, many stores are still out of stock within the hour of delivery, and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it unexpected.
Sales have seen a "strong" increase in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a sale scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times are making it difficult.
It predicts higher production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early unlocking of inventory, some stores are unable to honor the Wednesday promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a distribution industry expert at the Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish their stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in small stocks which, when exhausted, leave large empty shelf spaces, reinforcing the impression of scarcity.
 Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products like toilet rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce the panic,  Russell Zimmerman explained to ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent paper, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers were on holiday during the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin-based daily, included an eight-page envelope intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March in which they announced that they were not planning to introduce any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dryers, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) a pandemic.
Although the word  pandemic  refers only to the degree of spread of the disease and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments to act:
 All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are screening, testing, treating, isolating, locating and mobilizing their populations as part of the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
 We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction. 
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is  unprecedented .
He said in a statement released by CNN in February that  apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its emergence until its continued global spread. 
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that  we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus. 
And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.
The new pandemic status follows the decision by WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak:  in short, the situation is going to get worse. 
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, staying away from other people, and monitoring and quarantining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures of establishments.
The pandemic has caused severe socio-economic disruption globally, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages aggravated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Fake information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from areas with high cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and it is therefore believed that the virus may be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms had fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that this person had no apparent link to the subsequent outbreak in the fresh produce market.
Of the first outbreak cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case may date back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a significant underestimation of cases, particularly among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under representing 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the UK population would need to be infected before effective mass immunity could be achieved.
Cases are the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undetected infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official accounts of COVID-19 pandemic-related deaths generally refer to those who died who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 victims may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without being tested - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the over-mortality figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged  We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated , a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underestimation in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and especially health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-death ratio is 6.0 percent (97 039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-to-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).The other indicators are the mortality rate (fatality rate), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value in this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on estimates of mortality.
WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Without control, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease runs out of available hosts".
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant predictions at present about when this will happen.
The Chinese government's chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that  this could be completed by June  if all countries manage to mobilize to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2  will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two .
According to a study by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be needed until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or longer).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's very easily transmitted, will disappear completely and that it could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year".
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes rather nonspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, mucosity, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO says that about one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so the researchers recommended that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and screened to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is more commonly five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell was initially 30%, before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly through close contact and fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that unprotected coughing can send droplets from a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods of time, which could be projected when speaking.
The postings may land in the mouth or nose of other people nearby or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to be pulverised and thus cause airborne spread.
It can also be spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If there is a concern that it may be transmitted by stool, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms begin, however, transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appear suggesting transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others, and the virus survives on surfaces for hours or even days.
In particular, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the UK authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus, the Sarbecovirus subgenus (B lineage) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96 percent identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Comparison of the whole genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92 percent common genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by scanning.
A study comparing PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that the scanner should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.
LOMS published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first release on 17 January.
The test uses reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test may be performed on breath samples or blood.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a sample of the rhinopharynx but a throat sample can also be used.Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these were found to be reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral glass opacities and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently building an international online database of imaging results of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited accuracy for detecting COVID-19.
A major study in China compared chest scans with PCR and showed that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect virus characteristics in both X-ray and scanner imaging.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who are suspected of having been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Measures of physical distancing have also been recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of those communities do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective eyewear. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications were launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence in the vicinity of other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing, coughing, or sneezing.
That's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks through its protective shell.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
LOMS advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in a number of ways (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, 100% sodium hypochlorite, 0.1% hydrogen peroxide, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a daycare, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common areas, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their elbows folded or a handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projectile postings when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
LOMS issued instructions explaining where and when to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, which is a major source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene. The use of masks has also been recommended for those caring for someone who may be affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they face a significant risk, such as caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their populations to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical cloth masks. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without a mask or other means of covering one's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed masks on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket must wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed masks on passengers on inter-city trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a mask mandatory for all outings, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask for those who cannot afford it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus urged by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the outbreak. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term social distancing with physical distancing, clarifying the goal of reducing physical contact by maintaining social ties, whether virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term social distancing was intended to suggest that total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to stay in contact with others through other means.Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with someone you live with who does not have the virus or has no symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for those diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and those who suspect they may be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper quarantine, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is high were advised to quarantine for 14 days from the time they may have been last exposed.
The control strategies for an outbreak are containment or elimination, and mitigation.
The first phase of the outbreak is the targeting of people with HIV/AIDS.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Both mitigation and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to control the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction rate to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; public social distancing measures, such as closing schools and religious services; a public effort to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions, such as cleaning surfaces. More drastic measures to control the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued travel alerts for infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who quarantined themselves, and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing down but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce healthcare demand by two thirds and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.
Elimination may be prioritized, but should be continued as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), otherwise transmission will rebound rapidly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term action to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications or drinking as well as resting may help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that certain traditional and artisanal remedies can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, canceling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and isolating patients tested positive for COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of ventilators and available intensive care beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus may date back to 1 December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are usually related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. One theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; in other words, it was zoonotic in origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Province Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major railway junction.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data showed that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the world's largest number of confirmed cases. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and introduced border controls.
National responses have included containment measures such as quarantines (also known as stay-at-home orders, open-on-site orders, or containment orders) and curfews.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were experiencing some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion two days later  about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case was dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, which she reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
LOMS was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have been warned for spreading rumors about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a people's war  to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the largest quarantine in human history , a health cordon was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting an estimated 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government instituted new measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holidays.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transportation has been altered and China's museums have been temporarily closed.
Travel controls have been implemented in many cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to some form of travel restriction.After the epidemic entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being imported from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international travellers entering the city.On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, this time via a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted within the country has been essentially stopped, and the epidemic has been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the start of the lockdown.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when this policy would end.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March and gave monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Council of Affairs announced a day of mourning to begin with a three-minute silence on 4 April at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online to observe physical distancing and avoid a renewal of the COVID-19 outbreak.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji worshippers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of causing the outbreak.
On 22 February, of the church's 9,336 members, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea have been quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also reached and thus modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organized program in the world to test the population for the virus, and isolate all infected people and track and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
Testing methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus testing drives delivering results the next day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities.South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for accusing Moon of mismanaging the epidemic by the government or praising his response.
On 23 March, South Korea had the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all people arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for assistance in testing for the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the outbreak.
LOMS noted the contrast between the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, where the Chinese authorities were accused of concealment that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government has provided regular reports to avoid panic on Lunar New Year's Eve.
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while this was certainly not a WHO recommendation, it was a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated and he spoke of a fact that is unprecedented in the history of public health. On 30 January, following the confirmation of an inter-human transmission in China and the increase in the number of cases outside other countries, WHO declared the epidemic to be an international public health emergency (IHMP), the second such measure to be invoked since the 2009 pandemic of influenza by the US HPAI.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that the USPPI was due to the risk of global spread, particularly for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said:  there is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade  and  WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel .
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even though it is about to emerge.
Tedros then said that we are as strong as our weakest link  and urged the international community to invest today or pay more tomorrow . On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the force of the entire UN system into the response.
A UN crisis management team has therefore been activated, allowing for the coordination of the entire UN response, which according to WHO will allow them to focus on the health response while other agencies can contribute their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic.
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to send international and WHO experts to China to support national management and assess the severity and transmission of the disease by holding workshops and meetings with key national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess the impact of response activities at provincial and county level, including in urban and rural areas. On 25 February, WHO said that the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, indicating that although it is too early to talk about a pandemic, each country should nonetheless enter the preparation phase.
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment had been raised from high to very high, its highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergency Management Programme, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up".
This virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared, adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid the worst.
Ryan then said that current data does not allow public health officials to predict a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.
On 11 March, WHO declared that the coronavirus outbreak could be classified as a pandemic.
The Director-General indicated that WHO was extremely concerned by both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction . WHO has faced significant criticism for its management of the pandemic, which was deemed inadequate, including due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to benefit from relief interventions and that this responsibility rests with the government.
The group insisted that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has a right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are taking on the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were removed from office following their handling of quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political officials to the epidemic in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping from the popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the original idea that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that claimed COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus the Chinese virus or Wuhan virus, saying that censorship in China has overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic, which was later branded as racism by some opponents and intended to divert attention from his administration's inability to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the US government detailing the broad outlines of a communication ploy apparently coming from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows:
We are asked to try to convey this message in every possible way, including press conferences and television appearances. News organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and 'generosity politics'.
Borrell also said that China is aggressively insisting that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid to the latter two countries in advance.
The 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union towards Italy, which is affected by the coronavirus.

This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous high-ranking political source as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was little or no use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of embarking on a charm offensive, geopolitical and diplomatic.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] is assuming that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to return the same if needed.
The scale of NATO's Defender 2020 military exercise, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States will be reduced.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise:  In the current public health crisis, it puts at risk not only the lives of US troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the people of the countries in which they operate.  The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other former and current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying his country was struggling to combat the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions on Iran. The epidemic prompted calls for the US to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election chances in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive  quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over how to respond to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for accusing Moon of mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections, and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a worldwide increase in the use of equipment to combat the outbreak, panic purchases and disruption of factory operations and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruption.
Several localities also faced panic purchases which led to the disappearance of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, shelves, leading to shortages.
The technology sector in particular has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to 20 times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will put healthcare professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigoes to sell Australian products to China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food products, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy did not experience a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials unlocked pork reserves to ensure sufficient livelihoods for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, it was found that the viral outbreak was a major destabilising threat to the world economy.

The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures put in place in a timely manner by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did during the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closure of public spaces, particularly tourist attractions, and government recommendations against all travel worldwide.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to falling demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with Chinese New Year.

Many Lunar New Year events were cancelled and many tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, requiring most workplaces not to reopen until then.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.

Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the lockdown imposed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit.Nearly half a million German firms switched their employees to a government-subsidised parttime work scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German parttime work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organisations as well as individuals, both employees and self-employed, globally.
The arts and culture sector organisations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the state) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists where possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms.Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Lent penance period, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday services; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or television while others offer worship in drive-ins.
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square which emptied itself of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Health Minister announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and locals to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.

Some artists have sought ways to continue creating and sharing their work on the Internet as a replacement for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their work.
Online, many internet memes on the topic of coronavirus have spread as many favor humor and distraction over uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to residents of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the epidemic to new susceptible countries, Italians, who are the first European country to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may also face suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has caused a furor on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the UK and the US have reported rising levels of racist insults, as well as assaults.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a  Chinese virus , a term his detractors consider racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, and studying in major Indian cities have reportedly been harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that is why God took his revenge on them.
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which called them  false . In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents was fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as  foreign waste  that should  be eliminated .
Many paid access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the epidemic available in open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It's used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
This variability is likely to have a significant impact on reported mortality rates, which may be considerably overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or spectra.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing from pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep airways by aspiration catheter, or spitting (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the E  gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the China National Medicines Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019 (2019-nCoV) novel coronavirus real-time RT-PCR diagnostic device to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests had inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a testing bottleneck at the CDC in Atlanta. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were given permission to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Samples must be collected and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for detecting COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing one device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EU) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an ERA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to scale up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 literature study concluded that  pulmonary X-rays have low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT scan can be conclusive even before symptoms appear .
Typical symptoms of DMT include multi-lobed bilateral glass-like opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR with DMT in Wuhan, the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that DMT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that DMT not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19 .In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and for population monitoring. Testing can be done in central laboratories (CLAs) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems in many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required before analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and can therefore now distribute their antibody testing tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were powerful enough to be used.
Hong Kong has implemented a plan whereby suspected cases can stay at home,  the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube , patients spit inside, return it and later receive the test result. The UK NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used.
The drive centres have enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screening in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had the capacity to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient setting, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance if the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study found that in calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analyzing samples from 64 patients at a time, grouping samples and testing only if the combined sample is positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000-meter improvised emergency detection laboratory called Huo-Yanom (Chinese: 火眼, French: 火眼) was opened on 5 February 2020 and can process more than 10,000 BGI samples per day.
The modelling, which was carried out in 5 days and supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, revealed that cases in Hubei Province would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this testing capacity.
The Wuhan lab was soon followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays have been released to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without a liquid-handling robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagent became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
This situation has led some authors to consider sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now the country testing the largest portion of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and is in the process of intensifying testing to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for making kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not released until 28 January, delaying the availability of the tests in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, along with Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and screening recommendations of health experts.
However, experts indicate that the high availability of testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been increased over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended intensified screening programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States to be delayed, and stocks of swabs and chemical reagents have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were defective. The government then removed bureaucratic barriers to private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it will withdraw the kits that gave erroneous results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them in the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a  high error rate  and that it did not  use them . The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who test positive and tracing of those who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two series of tests on the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, approximately ten days apart.
Nearly half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
With the restrictions on movement in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on the scheduled holiday end date of March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most testing, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are better at detecting people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without testing capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column  Positive in % of tests  depends on the national screening policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospital will have a higher positive test percentage than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of washing hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at "key times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal route.
Respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecating, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap on hand, you can wash your hands with ash.
before, during and after preparation of meals;
before and after caring for a sick person;
After changing a baby's diaper or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after being bitten or coughed/sneezed;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to reduce the number of children who die during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to slight improvements in the growth rate of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50 percent.
The introduction of handwashing measures could reduce diarrhoea by about a third, comparable to the achievement of providing clean drinking water to low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (AIRs), an act that should be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main causes of death among children under five, is the leading cause of death, claiming nearly 1.8 million victims each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary measures under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor harmful effect is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis of the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Hand washing with soap at five key times of the day is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the fecal-oral route: before and after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hand washing is also appropriate to prevent the transmission of disease, including before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 hand hygiene study of 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle (77%), and China had the lowest rate (23%). There are now several methods to change behaviour and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a  Primary Health Care Programme  to promote children's health and education.
The two-year annual deworming, combined with daily handwashing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste, is at the heart of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate micro-organisms on the skin, soap or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase the solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter from the soil, are difficult to dissolve in water.
However, a proper water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transfer is unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still says that  liquid soap dispensers are preferable .
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended for people concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms are resistant to.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin-protective surfactant, more complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as special triclosan-containing antibacterial soaps in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a water-free hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-water hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most are formulated from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to produce a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to produce a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively kill germs.
Water-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Water-alcohol solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the main cause of gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or water-alcohol solution should be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The palm and back of both hands and the fingernail spaces should be held in front of each other for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have soap and water at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to drying of the skin if the formula is not strengthened by emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing with soap and water.
Non-aqueous products, while effective, do not remove organic matter from hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is attenuated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low income areas cannot afford to buy soap, and instead use ash or clay.
Ash or earth may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands properly to prevent disease transmission by following the following steps:
Wet your hands with running water, whether warm or cold.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Spray plenty of soap on the hands by rubbing them together, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Washing in a stagnant water basin may lead to re-contamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to re-contaminate. The areas most often overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the under nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin promotes the development of skin lesions which may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a suspended and perforated can or canister and/or using ash if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a matter of debate.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the wiping industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was carried out by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene levels offered by more modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a hot air hand dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the finger pulp and by 254% on the palms.
Air-dried hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms. The scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the unit at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows micro-organisms to be spread to a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
After drying of the hands, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
The hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in medical settings became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy in preventing illness in hospital settings (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to moisten and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other, passing between the fingers.
If there is any residue under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs in water can linger on hands, it is important to rinse and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands when they come into contact with surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that inadequate hand-washing is still unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the risk of catheter-related blood infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for hand washing and rubbing in the health field.
The draft Hand Hygiene Guidelines drawn up by the Organisation can also be consulted on the website to gather comments from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is demonstrated.
The World Health Organisation has defined five indications for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before aseptic gesture; and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "medicinal" or "anti-microbial") gives the hand washing agent a germ-killing action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widespread. To 'rub' one's hands for surgery, one needs a tap that can be opened and closed without touching the hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water from the forearms should not leak to the hands.
After washing hands, it is advisable to dry hands with a sterile cloth and to wear a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing hand washing frequency beyond 35%.
If hand washing with ordinary soap is compared to hand washing with antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infections transmitted through food is more than three times higher. Similarly, hand washing with alcohol and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, finds that the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands.In order to improve hand hygiene in healthcare facilities, it is possible to train staff on hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available and to send written and verbal reminders about this.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries handwashing with soap is considered a cheap and essential tool for maintaining health and even for maintaining proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap and handwashing facilities at home, school and work places makes it difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene practices.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find handwashing faucets near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building handwashing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and raising awareness of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
Monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary for this to be successful.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. In promoting handwashing in schools, one example is UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while adhering to other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of hand hygiene campaigns to reduce childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that claims to encourage behavioural change. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the number of healthy years of life gained (i.e. DALYs avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for vulnerable people such as mothers just having a baby or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British founder of modern nursing.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and hospital-acquired infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a vital means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, signs illustrating  good hand-washing techniques  have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It originated from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but the expression has become widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes a compulsive washing of her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience for the crimes she has committed and incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or contemplating unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and place more value on handwashing devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of purification, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which involves using water rather than soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing rituals promoted in many religions, including Baha'i and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual hand washing (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in Christianity, and wudhu in Islam.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash one's hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls at the workplace
COVID-19 workplace risk controls refer to the implementation of workplace health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other workers, in which case only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Jobs at moderate risk include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density work environments and certain high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
LOSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, rising to very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or handle samples from people with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to care for other people or fear possible exposure.
Business models may change, both in terms of goods demanded and the means of acquiring them (e.g. shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be halted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the controls needed to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of an outbreak response include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework used globally in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on worker behaviour.They may be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes to work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help to prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the risk to the worker, appropriately adapted as needed (e.g. respiratory masks), worn correctly and systematically, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and other workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing etiquette, including covering the mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing napkins and trash cans, preparing for remote work or staggered working hours as needed, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever suppressants or other medications that act on symptoms. They also recommend that flexible sick leave policies be in place, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at average risk include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company headquarters or because the person has recently travelled internationally to an area with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density work environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, completing in-person meetings with virtual customers, replacing staggered washing schedules, disrupting travel to non-essential areas of the workplace, providing training on COVID-19 safety, providing a safe environment for workers, providing training on the use of protective clothing and other protective equipment, providing a safe environment for workers at high risk, providing training on the use of hand-washing equipment and other forms of protection, providing a safe environment for workers at high risk of COVID-19 and providing a safe and effective means of communication, including the development of a COVID-19 safety training and training for workers, providing a safe and effective workplace for workers at high risk of COVID-19 and other workers.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following: separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person and providing a protective mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected thereafter.For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include postponing travel in case of illness and self-isolation and informing the onboard medical centre immediately if a fever or other symptoms develop on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolate's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choral classes or meals at the canteen, increasing the space between offices, staggering arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with flu symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered.For law enforcement officers who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulance workers, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before reuse with a household cleaner wipes or sprays and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
LOSHA considers certain sanitary and funeral workers to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health care providers, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or manipulate samples from patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Procedures for producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of death; they are at very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing procedures that produce aerosols.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some sanitary and funeral environments.
Samples must be handled using level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering separate waiting rooms be separated based on suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing procedures that produce aerosols.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or higher filtration respiratory masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide better protection and comfort for workers. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
LOMS recommends that only screening personnel at the point of entry wear a surgical mask.
For those collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without procedures that produce aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, a jacket and gloves.
In the case of procedures producing aerosols, the surgical mask shall be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
As the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a COVID-19 patient's room to those directly involved in his or her care, using PPE only for the specific task, continuing to use the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

To all the employees of the Wikimedia Foundation
OBJECTIVE: [Covid-19] Lifting the burden and preparing for the future
The following is the text of the Decision:
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organisation.
The camaraderie and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant chats is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we are fortunate to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud to count you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed his appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia at this time, and what a powerful symbol it is that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible because of your work, whether you keep the sites operational, pay our colleagues or keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make substantial adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.
Adjustments in Our Work and Schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organisation during this period.
We were primarily concerned with eliminating stress and supporting our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
All staff, contractors and contractors:
Our target daily working time will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not declaring a public holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be of use to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we do.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please notify Bryan from T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you and ensure that your situation is given the necessary attention from management.)
The hourly staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities towards our subcontractors and our fellow temporary staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours of work under normal conditions.
This applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way of evading the stress of the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like this.
Again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask that you contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most indispensable projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We have no intention of working twice as hard to make up for lost time when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and we will endeavour to set new targets and timetables where appropriate.
What about the APP?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines considerably reduces the workload and the pressure of current planning throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and the teams of the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Position, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of an abundance of caution, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building has its own due diligence protocol which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork facility, which has shared with us and all staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in line with San Francisco's guidance.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we have also discussed the idea of renting a building in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to working remotely are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Making video the norm, through tools like Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant chat and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a group note).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR operations team is studying ergonomics guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized for delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and the possibility of focusing on one's own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the rest of the story, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Keeping in touch despite COVID-19 problems
We'll send you an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll take this moment to share more updates, answer your questions, and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can still find the information in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and bring all the information together in one place.
We also endeavour to maintain regular communications with staff members residing in countries which are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a large workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, please do not hesitate to call and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and provide the link if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
It is rather a matter of recognizing that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we feel are necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to give our movement the help it needs, and to offer the world the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to help each other and prepare for the important work that is to come in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need each of you to achieve it, so you need to take care of yourself and your families so that you can give your best when the time comes.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face.
The following are the key figures in the report: Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
bLangiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme bound to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
LACE2 is a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the amount of angiotensin II. LACE2 is also the entry point into cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminated renal amino acid transporter collectrin domain.
LACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
LACE2 is present in most organs: lACE2 is bound to the cell membrane mainly of type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE cleaved the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
LACE2 in turn cleves the carboxyl-terminated amino acid phenylamine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
LACE2 can also cleav several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, lapelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
LACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into the cells of some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule protein S1 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process also requires initiation of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 host serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment.This leads some to believe that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing the standard treatment with ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 demonstrated that  use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects. 
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia.
Human recombinant angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is being promoted as an innovative treatment for severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of action (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people intolerant to classical RAS or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. RhACE2 as an infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying people ( contacts ) who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographic location of application users, raise questions about privacy.
Other less intrusive options exist, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it was provided as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched StopKorona! a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development and could be rolled out in the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement apps modelled on TraceTogether in Singapore and based on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to introduce a geo-tracking app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned several possible practical problems with the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small fraction of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple is only allowing official or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, particularly the potential dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for a limit on this type of surveillance.
These organisations have set out eight conditions to be met in government projects:
the supervision should be  lawful, necessary and proportionate ;
Extensions of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19.
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
Protection against abuse and remedies for citizens should be provided for;
 significant participation  of all  stakeholders involved  would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups.  The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters without Borders (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to tackle the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the OS tracking mechanism from their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need to access personal location data; several systems have been designed to use central servers only for intercommunication, thus allowing privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, which they then combined to send SMS alerts to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following the major changes in information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is publicly available through a number of applications and websites.Countries such as Germany have considered using centralized privacy systems.
The details were not yet disclosed on 6 April 2020.
Privacy-friendly contact tracing is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralised and decentralised approaches and does not constitute a single protocol.Decentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all matches are made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white paper  Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic  published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International TCN Coalition was founded by groups that came together around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the release of the source code for the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, saying it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-assuring encryption.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools for governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking applications
Google and Apple plan to address the issues of adoption and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through OS updates and subsequently removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Drug repositioning (also called re-orientation, re-design, re-assignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) refers to the reconversion of an approved drug for a different disease or medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research focus currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of plasma from recovering patients.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these link sites provides a realistic blueprint for the development of an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 include papain type protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, protein S, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds which they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in New York State would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors have advised that this medicine should be used when there is no other option.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen have stated that favipiravir is  clearly effective .
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and the other half lumifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the drug is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to have children.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that no benefit was observed.
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations which can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by University Hospitals of Cleveland; one involving people with moderate disease and the other involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

The study called COLCORONA enrolled 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir: lumifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repurposable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many development attempts are underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak occurred worldwide in 2020, prompting significant investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative's requirements for developing a vaccine, defined in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the goal of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets passed into phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, including 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or design).
A phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and conducted in several centres, all with the aim of determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated procedure, it would take about one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, announced that it was developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in laboratory with human trials scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac  large sums of money for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine , which sparked protests from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that human testing of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for COVID-19 vaccine research including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in developing a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of China sending the sequence.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 COVID-19 medical research projects, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a $192 million allocation for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national vaccine bank containing several new vaccines that could be used if further coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, claiming that the subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro-needles triggered a significant antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a potential DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the immune system's production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities joined forces to access IBM supercomputers, coupled with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is planned to include 4 170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for implementation of Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies worldwide. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were ongoing; all vaccines were viral vectors, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
While most cases produce mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and the virus is spread primarily through close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Since these droplets are produced by exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or to surfaces rather than presenting a long-distance infectious risk.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although contagion is possible before symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the general public to wear masks vary, with some authorities advising against their use, others recommending their use, and still others requiring their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to seek medical advice immediately.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially only showed chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be as long as 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under investigation.The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections detected on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both spectation and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that unprotected coughing can send droplets as far as 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside patients' rooms produced positive viral RNA samples.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause airborne spread.
Although there are concerns about spreading through stool, this risk is perceived to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others, and the virus survives on surfaces for hours or even days.
In particular, the virus was detected after 1 day on cardboard, after 3 days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after 4 hours on 99% copper.
This varies, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates it and eliminates it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called  spicule  (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12 percent of people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and disruption of the immune system during disease progression, however acute myocardial damage may also be related to lACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with a poor prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 exhibits tropism for the respiratory tract epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secreting T cells have been associated with recruitment of lIL6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or expectorant sampling may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were being developed but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experiment showed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first near-patient test on March 21, 2020, to be used later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multilobal bilateral glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms seen at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation may occur with progression of the disease.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the postmortem are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytal hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant multinucleated cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
• pneumonia in recovery: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when you cough or sneeze and using the inside of your elbow when you don't have a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face with a cloth in public places to limit transmission in asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large gatherings of people.
The distance guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the peak epidemic, also known as flattening the curve.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if soap and water are not available.For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not an active antiseptic for hands.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care which may include hydration, oxygen therapy and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being investigated.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments may be helpful in those with moderate symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Resuscitation doctors and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen as the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, particularly in care settings where procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.
The equipment recommended is: PPE jacket, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves.If these are available, preference is given to respiratory masks (to face masks).
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorised the use of these masks under an emergency use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not indicated.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or as a last resort, handmade masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19 respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people.Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal cannula or positive double-level airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both produce the same benefits for people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the capacity of the health care system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of the cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimise oxygen delivery and minimise the risk of ventilation-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation units.
Research into potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs under testing are already approved in other indications and testing is already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tried on people with severe illness.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA granted temporary authorization for plasma from recovering people as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and an ID.
The application is able to detect  close contacts  using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities.Mass data analysis from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who are not in quarantine.
In Italy, the regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that  40% of people continue to move .
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying,  Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail for harming people's mental health and well-being .
The disease may be moderate in progression with few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, whereas severe or critical cases take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however data are lacking for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, with renal failure occurring in 4% of patients in this group.
About 20 to 30 percent of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average of seven days between hospitalisation and death.
In an early case study, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Post-mortem histopathological examinations of lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The picture of the lung is similar to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of people in hospital had pre-existing conditions.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Under-reporting of moderate cases may lead to overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die than nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong hospital administration has observed a 20 to 30 percent drop in respiratory capacity in some people who have recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggest organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in those cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 and tested positive for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It's believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, through the spread of infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIM-10 emergency pathology codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 cases without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9 percent (153,822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4 600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest in men in their 50s, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for this difference between the sexes are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be part of it.
Immune differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking among women and the development of comorbidities such as hypertension in men at a later age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not collect data associated with the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be  COVID-19 .
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus and D stands for disease, with 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses  COVID-19 virus  and  virus responsible for COVID-19  in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as  coronavirus .
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as  coronavirus  and  Wuhan coronavirus .
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of place names in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed a respirator valve in an emergency and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 valves required overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about the origin, spread, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that humans are capable of spreading the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organisation launched the SOLIDARITY trial to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the lACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to induce a rapid immune response in the human body in case of new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research is focused on the spicular S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies are expected to be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated already approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries expected to report by the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
Preliminary data suggested remdesivir was effective in March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some have called for an independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of 1 gram, indicates that doubling this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or lumifenovir for COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein that is initiated by the serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Loseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that Lhydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
A non-randomized phase 2 trial is underway nationwide in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such developments as are suspected to be the cause of death in some affected persons.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine re-release syndrome by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for RCS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody therapy can generate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from recovering patients, which is the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
