Where do you live?
Why would I want to kill you all?
The bathroom is upstairs.
She cared for her son.
Somehow we survived.
It seemed to me that Tom was not doing what he was supposed to be doing.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Don't thank me.
What is the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to believe me.
If I love you, what's it to you?
I just got up.

It was just the icing on the cake.
Choose one.
He got what he wanted.
She drinks like a straw.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Meet me with Tom.
After much deliberation, I finally made things at random.
You are absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You have failed me.
What is this?
I'm glad to see you too.
That was very good.
She takes care of her elderly mother.
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Go straight ahead.
Just like a bean.
It's empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Maria was stunned.
I'm giving up.
I can't sit still.
Have a good Christmas!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the lines.
I had a fast lunch.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I almost forgot my passport.
Why do you do that, if I may ask?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Give me an example.

Why do you behave this way?
He does not miss anything.
We live in the nuclear age.

Tom is getting on my nerves.
I'm studying now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This is not true.
I took the first step.
Can You Keep a Secret?
I nodded once.
Do not waste words.
Did you do it on purpose?
Don't get caught up in it.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of the building.
I'm a beginner at this.
This tea is good.
Cover your mouth when coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
It all happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I made him nervous.
I pretended not to see.
I tried to be kind.
I'm not wearing anything.
The success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse overheated.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was furious as a bat.
Turn left.
Don't yell at me!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You are under oath.
I wish I knew.
I don't believe that.
Are you looking for something in particular?
Do not worry!
Caroline is sad because she cannot get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
It's standing there.

The bedroom is upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you going to do today?

I would like to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father is too old to work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.

You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
The bird on the roof is a crow.
How do I call a taxi?
You didn't answer the question.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
I can ski.
Why do you think that?
It's snowing today.
Today I have a headache.
I think Tom pulled the thicker end.
I'll do my homework tomorrow.
By the way, where do you live?
The office door is yellow.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to bed?
I have many friends.
This is not exactly what I wanted.
Is it yours?
The house is made of brick.
They all lie.
I took the first step.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Can you help us?
Keep calm.
One day it will be mine.
I'm sick of it all!
It was terrible.
I won't let you do that.
How was your French class?
Keep a positive attitude.
I made him nervous.
Is breakfast included in the price?
Is everything all right with us?

At this stage in world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know it and I know it. There is not one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he did write it, he would know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I was regularly paid to keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper for which I work. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be crazy enough to write what he honestly thinks would be out on the street, looking for some other job. If I had allowed my honest opinion to appear in just one issue of the newspaper for which I was hired, I would have been fired from my job in less than 24 hours. (...)
