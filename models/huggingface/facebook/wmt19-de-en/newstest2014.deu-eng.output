Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village car park was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall traffic light.
Two turbines so close to each other: intention or prank?
The Mayor of London gave a clear answer to that question yesterday.
"The town hall traffic light was installed at that time because it secures the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the residents of the mountain.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg and Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ‹.
"Due to the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to be set up for their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg district office.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about ten percent are heavy goods vehicles," Arnold emphasises.
Therefore the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety simply proceeds here," so Arnold.
Altogether four traffic shows were accomplished, also a roundabout was considered, however because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when the traffic light poles were chosen: "By means of a van specially loaded with particularly long logs for us, we tested whether these vehicles could exit Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without bending over the traffic light poles."
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is "the most modern on the market at the moment," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that glow so powerfully that the lights are clearly visible to drivers, even in low-lying sunlight, for example.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume around 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new facility: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, the pedestrian will immediately get green; if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
"If a group of people or people with mobility difficulties cross the road, the green period will be extended, so everyone can safely cross the road," Mr Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think as a partner and observe the road surface.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic lights turned green for pedestrians, a luxury vehicle sped through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has been writing down the hardships of his childhood and youth from his soul.
The Carinthian poet has described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to crude violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner Prize winner is known above all as a prose author, and his work contains few theatre texts.
For his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Tongenspitze," which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz, Gerhard Fresacher has compiled a collage of prose texts.
The playwright combines elements from the autobiographically influenced novel "The Serf" (1987) with prose works from "Corpse, Eavesdropping on His Family" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa on which people are apparently copulating and masturbating - the eight-member ensemble shimmers through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance whitewashes the original with a plethora of directorial ideas, familiar from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms.
Especially the actresses get their turn at the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic realizations.
They are harshly touched, their heads submerged in water, their evening gowns pinned against the wall.
Squeezed into cellophane or bodice, they stack on dangerously high heels through the production, either monologuing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this exhausting way.
The evening has its best moments when people sing - the spectrum ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the over-the-top performance calm down a little, and Winkler's almost absurd humour flashes.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the crumbling highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every kilometre driven and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding US roads.
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups, arguing that the government should be able to use the small boxes to record miles driven - and possibly where they were driven - and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on how to proceed, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently looking at how they can switch over the next decade to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
"It's not something we're just going to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record miles driven by all California drivers in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is going to change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes paid by Americans at the pump, is broke.
But America doesn't fill up as much as it used to.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by even a cent when the price of petrol is high.
"The gasoline tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible long-term alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea has resonated with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behavior to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
California planners rely on the system to devise strategies to meet the state's ambitious, statutory climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also taken with the idea of having drivers pay according to the distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the House majority blocked the move, responding to concerns from rural lawmakers representing people who often have to travel many miles to work or the city on a daily basis.
Several states and major cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the fuel tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently fitted with the devices, motorists were skeptical that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and results management at Nevada's Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website, "It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-blown surveillance devices."
There was no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on individuals "daily movements.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to track the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan said, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not compete to help states tax motorists.
Rather, their aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, where drivers are expected to pay on the basis of miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also of interest to road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose not to use a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all state residents.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a wary public by equipping the devices with more features than fewer.
In New York City, transportation officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay for parking, pay for insurance only for miles driven, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles to help drivers avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," a city planning document says.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge red herring.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off charge or annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid or other vehicles that use little petrol, so that they too pay their fair share.
"There is no reason for surgery if one aspirin is sufficient," said Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislative and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team performs valiantly
The Volunteer Fire Brigade coped with their autumn test with flying colours, despite a shortage of staff.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder property in Burgberger Straße for his training session.
There, a short circuit is said to have occurred during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer had checked the situation for the first time, two people wearing breathing apparatus from the weir prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person was found and escorted outside.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as even a narrow staircase had to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and bales of straw in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was connected via an above-ground hydrant at a distance of around 100 metres.
Three fire attacks have now been carried out.
A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building.
During the drill, Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what can be accomplished with little available personnel.
In an emergency, support is provided through the Königsfeld Day Operations Group.
The commander was satisfied with the progress of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the president of the state parliament Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow will come from.
Together with the managing directors of the vocational schools as well as the district high school and the chairmen of the parents "advisory board, he investigated this important question at the Hochschwarzwald promotional centre.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasised Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the promotional centre, district grammar school and vocational school centre in Wälderstadt.
He also praised the county's family-friendly approach.
"It is important not only to look at the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, to look after the care of relatives," Wolf explained.
He added that more and more workers were looking after and caring for their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Anyone who has already become acquainted with the advantages of the region during his or her studies will often be able to maintain the regional economy with his or her acquired knowledge and skills, which will contribute to the strengthening of the region," said the President of the State Parliament.
Only if sufficient training places are offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand local public transport.
"Continue to be persistent and ensure that public transport improves," he told local politicians present.
Enjoy an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the senior citizens of Dietingen for coffee, cake and then for a snack.
In former times, the elderly were catered for in the rest area.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the St. Josef nursing home.
The inhabitants of the home were looking forward to the delicious cakes and tarts.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with standard tunes.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old schoolyard facing the refurbishment to Kirchstraße is to be added to the refurbishment cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard to stabilize and relieve the static load on the over one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the next step is to involve the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to draw up a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
Afterwards a cost calculation is to be made by specialists, which is to be put then to the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further proceeding on the table.
A decision is expected as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school, which was built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation will have to be completely renovated and placed on new substructures in the foreseeable future.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is in need of renovation mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, and has a forward inclination.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by pupils, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the refurbishment of the school grounds was planned as early as 2008 / 2009, but high unscheduled expenditure brought about a postponement.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the State Office for Monuments and Sites.
Should specifications come from this side, then the city Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the conservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now again being taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Green Party, has now joined the ongoing discussions about the future of the music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten."
Jazz and classical music belong together at the Stuttgart jazz location.
Özdemir, who is considered the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct seat in the Bundestag election on 22 September, thus contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is pushing for a reorganisation of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the course of studies Jazz and Pop will be shifted from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: 'super-tunnels' for drug smuggling discovered
Investigators have discovered and shut down a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling along the Mexico-US border.
According to US Customs, the more than 500 metre long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested and eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig under the radar," U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of California Laura Duffy said at a news conference outside a San Diego warehouse where one end of the tunnel was discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy said: "If you keep building these tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against drug cartels.
More than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico related to drug-related crime since 2006.
Constructed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took around a year.
The track layout was equipped in such a way that electrically driven cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters down to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and 90 centimetres in width.
It would also have been suitable for encouraging illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the marijuana seized.
All three face the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, the San Diego news conference said.
But it is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego.
They would do anything to get into the US.
No details were released about those arrested, at least one of whom was Mexican, it said.
They face up to ten years in prison.
2014 will be Geisinger's festival year
The anniversary of the town Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The recurrence of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the anniversary year is upon us.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in documents in 794.
In churches a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is to be an official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this prelude event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Churches-Hausen is celebrated in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate a return.
On Friday with a ceremonial act, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
On this festive weekend there is also the church festival in Kirchen-Hausen.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the solstice celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend in September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geising anniversary, a new chronicle will be published.
"However, it should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirche-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
Today's Geisingen also celebrates its birthday in 2014; in 1974, the present-day spatial landscape was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also otherwise a year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki guild of fools begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen celebrates 90 years and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation, which is in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen, in the year 764.
The document was made in churches (Hausen), which at that time was the court square.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year anniversary in 2014. In addition, the municipal reform dates back 40 years.
Council sets sights on rail tracks
Is the level crossing "Am Hirschen" to be extensively modified in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach will have to pay EUR 220 000 for this.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety at level crossings is to be increased - trains collide with other vehicles on a regular basis throughout Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the renovation measures, they must contribute one third of the costs, the remainder is shared between the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the "Am Hirschen" rail crossing to the local council.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting long timber, could also stand in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall so that the city could widen the adjacent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the local council, as some councils questioned the necessity of widening the roads: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The "Hirschen" level crossing is regularly used for transporting long timber.
Even timber from the "Kuhbach" area is sometimes transported along this route, because the vehicles, which are up to 20 metres long, cannot use the route at the Häberlesbrücke bridge because they cannot turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels will have to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the level crossing "Am" Hirschen "could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
Councils agreed to investigate the cost of the proposed widening of the road.
In spite of this, the reconstruction of the level crossing was approved by a majority with the proviso that the necessary retaining wall would be built in such a way that the city could expand the adjacent road in the direction of "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 metres for traffic.
The conversion of the level crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem concerning the access to the steeply rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg."
The administration had the railway's conversion plans examined by Ingenieurbüro Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would still be possible without further ado.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be excluded that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting up.
Responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road haulier.
The modification could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the turning function in the current state of construction, the conversion of the level crossing should not be approved, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is also considerably lower than at the other level crossings, because there is a stop in the middle right next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked at this point so that no collision was imminent.
The majority refused to approve the reconstruction of this level crossing, as the city of Schiltach "would have to bear the cost" of the problem with vehicles sitting on it, according to the councillors, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The committee considers the modifications at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach," for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway, to be unproblematic.
Esa Decides on Major Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years.
Thirty proposals were up for grabs, with five still in the running.
Distant worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets near other stars.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The choice is difficult: Should one search for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and thereby perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that are being asked by the heads of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is around one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees are examining the proposals and are consulting with researchers.
A final decision by the Scientific Programme Committee is expected in the next few days.
Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, which was launched in 2007, should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large clouds of gas - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity will be examined in more detail.
The possibilities are limited, however, and Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system play an important role.
These processes can be investigated exemplarily in our solar system.
With the "Solar Orbiter," Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (where the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is due to launch in 2017 and will observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, Esa is planning the first of a total of three L missions in the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it will reach Jupiter and study the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like ourselves, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid," Esa has already approved an M mission, the launch of which is scheduled for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the competition.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa," a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chance of being approved as an L-mission.
Physicists understand this to mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do it, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes to be stationed in space.
In contrast to systems on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that originated in the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which will explore black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which will detect and study Earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals for sample return transport from Mars, for research into the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics, have already been rejected.
Snowden willing to 'cooperate' with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has said he is prepared to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of fidelity and seeks to criminalise political expression with the threat of punishment, for which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can persuade the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: 'If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible.'
Relations between the US and Germany have been strained by allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the lawmaker who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said that the opportunity should be taken to hear Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he was "safe" there, the lawmaker said.
Snowden says in his letter that he faces a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his home country.
But he said he was touched by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians - including in the United States - have called the revelations of an unchecked system of extensive surveillance a public service.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities "once the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines Charges for Hand Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers who want to stow carry-on luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for a piece of carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although Wednesday's announcement said passengers would be allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to carry-on baggage in the overhead compartment and small bags under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier said it charged $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was aimed at getting travelers to pay upfront.
"We don't want to calculate that sum," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second pieces of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who have tried to avoid them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, with the result that the overhead compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Charges are one way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It was all about Frontier's most loyal customers, who had made it clear that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the Frontier gate may be allowed to take one piece of baggage free of charge, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures will be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee won't come into effect until the summer, but a precise date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay for the service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are raising enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have so far avoided charges for carry-on luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for carry-on baggage three years ago, and Allegiant Air, another low-cost carrier, followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said Jay Sorensen, an airline consultant who is closely monitoring the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brought in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a senior position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious to see what would await him at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual carry-on fee.
"The boarding process has been one of the smoothest I have experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and tangible discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went smoothly."
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 charge for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's move to charge for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to steer customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them, rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began issuing half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agent.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A Frontier flight over 1000 miles booked with a third-party provider will therefore earn customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to get a grip on Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant congregation of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Phrases from the Middle Ages."
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the parish council, went into the biblical proverbs in a lecture.
"Proverbs contain wisdom, rules or warnings," she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding biblical passages and explained the meaning.
She mentioned proverbs such as, "Let the eye of wood be watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, and cast an eye on a man; the Lord gives his own in his sleep, and washes his hands in innocence."
Several times, the speaker also let her listeners guess which proverb it was.
The parish councillor Christel Dehner took up the saying from the Middle Ages: All good things come in threes, make blue, beat something up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which she called "bridges to the past."
At the end, a raffle was raffled off.
The prizes lay covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round mingled also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry started today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 men and women who are already unskilled in the sector will be trained over three winters to become specialists in hotels and restaurants.
"What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits are manifold: the participants do not become unemployed, the companies get trained specialists, which are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment.
The Neubrandenburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA says an 'internal error' and not hackers are to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a flaw had crippled its public website for several hours, not hackers as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours, and that this is still not the case for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information was not at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have brought down the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, now finds itself in the public spotlight, facing sharp criticism in the wake of revelations in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad - a result of classified NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the Secret Service fueled initial speculation that today's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people out of work fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent was better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy office manager of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
This is because many companies have so far reacted cautiously when it comes to hiring.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the crafts, health care and care for the elderly."
Due to seasonal reasons, vacancies for hotel and catering staff have also been coming back in since September.
The winter season starts there in mid-December.

Bombardier profits fall after drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after coming under pressure from declining orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go commercial next September under the ambitious schedule.
The test aircraft's maiden flight a month and a half ago has been followed by only three other launches, making it doubtful whether the test phase will proceed as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a stock market plunge of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from "outperform" to "sector perform," noting that the stock has limited price potential over the next quarter or two.
"While weaker aircraft deliveries were widely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transportation sector," Doerksen said in a letter to customers.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft's testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries will catapult the company into the lower end of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But binding orders for the 177 CSeries have so far been modest, as potential buyers await the results of flight tests to see if the company's claims about the new jet's fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chief executive Pierre Beaudoin said he was confident Bombardier would meet its target of 300 binding orders by the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company's management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the plane's service life.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, with the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer will be able to commission a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was reviewing the commissioning planning (EIS) and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even though it appears to be in line with Bombardier's internal planning - reinforces our view that commissioning will be delayed until the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue fell slightly, to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The aerospace division's backlog at September 30 was $32.9 billion, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, results were in line with our guidance, but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, announced that revenue in this division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The Transportation Division's backlog at September 30 was $32.6 billion, up slightly from December 31.
Profit margins in the transport sector have been affected by handling problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares were down 8.5 percent at 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unidentified man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While airport officials announced via Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed, he said.
Media also reported several people were injured.
US President Barack Obama is being kept informed of the situation on an ongoing basis, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, where eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure lounges, several media outlets reported.
One traveler told CNN that many people had taken shelter in panic.
Travellers would have screamed and children would have cried.
Panic had broken out among those waiting, many hiding behind chairs for fear.
He heard two gunshots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA employee suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene, he said, was "like a movie."
He was then taken to a security area himself, the man said.
The shots are said to have been fired near a security checkpoint.
Airport building evacuated
Television images showed scores of ambulances and police cars parked outside a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building to safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special operations commando and a rifle lying on the ground.
The incident began at 9.30am (local time), airport management said on Twitter.
Access roads were closed, causing long tailbacks, according to CNN.
Air traffic has been temporarily suspended except for landings, it said.
On CNN, however, several airmen were also seen taking off.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles' LAX airport is one of the largest in the United States.
Cocaine addict lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld figure Neil Scarborough
Lawyer feared his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court
A prominent criminal defense lawyer who warned a drug lord against a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction might be exposed has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld figure Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug-trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by detectives, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he represented in an earlier drug case.
Officers watched Scarborough, 32, deliver three bags of cocaine to the barrister's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was having dinner with colleagues at the Bar Association.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were being monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction would become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted of two counts of obstruction of justice at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial.
He admitted cocaine possession during an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police investigating Scarborough found he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and place the 60 percent purity drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's dustbin.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough made regular phone calls to Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers "Ewood Park football ground.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
It was revealed in court that Ditta was a 'regular user' of cocaine after tests revealed Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed their discussion was covered by "legal secrecy."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a sample of his hair was taken.
Under police questioning, he said he ran an office both at his home address and at work, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was revealed in court that he had called key drug trafficking figures, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and told them what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: 'A criminal barrister should know better than anyone that you are not breaking the law.'
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney by engaging too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer supplying drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for those people.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He cooperated as far as possible with the police investigation so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming: 'If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I would do it straight away.'
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead, of Lancashire Police, said: 'Mr Ditta made the step from criminal defence lawyer to criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organised criminals.'
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and inspire public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also resulted in three convictions for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a Q & A section about himself in which he said his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America, that his ultimate dinner guest was Muhammad Ali, and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary works of sacred music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two divine services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life," which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with a performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 7 p.m. during the evening mass in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10: 15 a.m. during the divine service in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs in celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass," D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The mass will be performed as part of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider the choir is accompanied by the wind section of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism visibly gives way to confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, fundamental changes will be made in the Haslach (SE) pastoral care unit, for example.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes.
The fundamental decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
During the course of the day, it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new is giving way hesitantly but visibly to confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the pastoral staff ranged from ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council.
On the basis of a presentation, the regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
Accordingly, SE Haslach as a congregation will in future form a corporation under public law, which will assume the rights and duties of the six individual church congregations to date.
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of trustees, in which the pastor is represented by virtue of his office.
From each parish at least two elected members are to be represented, in the six parishes so-called parish teams are formed locally.
In the future, it will be their task to promote church life in the village.
With the question about the finances of the individual parish then showed up considerable need for discussion.
The changes foresee that accumulated funds in the parishes will be retained for specific purposes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire municipality.
Particularly with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which then affects all parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, investments were made only in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Bruno Prinzbach, chairman of Haslach's parish council.
Barbar Ritter, the chairwoman of the committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
In 2006, they set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five," and found that this was not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach chaplaincy unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The work will be fleshed out at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As Jörg-Arne Bias, managing director of the municipal utility company, confirmed to SÜDÑ, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year is incurred for a family of four from Pfullendorf.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase of the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity lines.
These quantify the additional costs arising for them from the energy transition, which they can levy through a levy on the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf municipal utilities form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete numbers would have to be computed, before the public utilities could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the figure likely to be closer to 2 cents.
Traffic lights on permanent red: Watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react or the light signal is defective.
What should you do then - drive in the red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is clear, he can continue driving, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad."
However, the waiting time had to be "reasonable," which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to persevere for at least five minutes before a traffic light malfunction is expected.
However, those who continue to drive despite the red light must be aware that they are fully to blame for any accident caused by this.
Who tolerates itself less than five minutes, waits under certain circumstances not long enough, warns Becker and refers to a resolution of the higher regional court Hamm.
In this case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red light and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but changed to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Parish council pleased with solid budget
Whenever the budget is discussed in council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success.
This became clear during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was more than one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at around 1.8 million euros, is also around one million euros above the budget.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax receipts and the municipal share of income tax.
The assets budget was again well above the planned values.
Last year it was EUR 2.5 million instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged.
"This is mainly due to the higher injection from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
As less investment was made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the allocation of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"You don't just shake up a work like this out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the local councillors were visibly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to dispense with high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, this in turn has often led to subsidies being cut back by the state.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various compensatory funds.
Among other things, cities and municipalities that apply for grants must provide certain lifting kits.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting sets, because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like subsidies," Gerster announced in this connection.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history with the male singing club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, during which he was solemnly honoured.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still has a lot of fun singing with the choir, which has become more than well-loved in the meantime.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral consultant on behalf of the Cecilia Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award ceremony, the 31st Autumn Festival proceeded in the usual way: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringer invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder."
They serenaded their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied."
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durch Tal."
With its mixed choir and its group of women - the "Impulschor" - the Liederkranz Salzstetten ensured the quota of women at the festival.
The mixed choir performed the Neapolitan folk songs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "Impulse Choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers "section of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to their homeland with" Was isch der Schwob? "by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's" Bierlied, "where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
There was a small side programme for the children - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Punch and Judy show and read a few stories that kept the children busy over lunch.
Childhood dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centres in the Zollernalbkreis are receiving mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwald Bote would like to support the institutions in realising their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day nurseries and crèches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can take part in the campaign.
If you have a building or beautification wish for your furnishings, you can apply with this with the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of the Schwarzwald Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, will select three wishes from all entries.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 Euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many diligent builders.
What is it about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and we have to ask ourselves: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" read the newspaper, which considers the draft law unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law "effectively puts a stranglehold on the media" by the government, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been "dealt a severe blow," calling the draft "draconian."
The passage of the law is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities for releasing footage from security cameras showing units dispatched to the scene allegedly robbing the luxury mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a top media official for questioning, although the subpoena was withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, as well as the risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere."
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they wanted with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for The Nation, who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"Leaving politicians to their own devices will bankrupt the country and take us back to the days of hunter-gatherers," he said.
Kenyan lawmakers have drawn public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their hefty salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
Despite the cold weather and rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose any of its importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant ceremony last Saturday, but Peter did not want to take part in it.
So all those who came without an umbrella or couldn't hold one for some reason were left behind.
That went to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as many speakers.
That is why Albrecht Schlenker, the chairman of the FC, spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
He thanked Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the local council, the companies involved and members of the association who contributed.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The retirees laid 400 square metres of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the state parliament member Karl Rombach.
Further welcoming words were given for the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn affected the original lawn in such a way that it could not be used.
Already 15 years ago, the first considerations for solving the problem arose, when the construction of a third pitch near the grounds of the football club or at the secondary school on Lake Salinensee was considered.
Both were discarded.
Six years ago, ideas came up to create an artificial turf pitch, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube as a leasehold, agreed to share the costs of 100 000 euros for the construction of the pitch and approved subsidies of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the local council decided to take over the remaining 366,000 euros out of the total cost of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
Construction of the 68 by 108 metre artificial turf pitch began on 4 June.
During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3000 cubic metres of soil were excavated, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, bribery of Members of Parliament and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its work.
This is likely to include the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting views.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for migrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD backed up its opposition to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group.
Evasive traffic was threatened on rural roads, which were already the focus of accidents.
From Pronold's point of view, the introduction of a toll for all cars would also only be a first step.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing foehn wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening at the Killesberg open-air stage.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for pop star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the picture gallery to see the "singing foehn wave."
Motorist seriously injured in crash
A 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to police, a 41-year-old woman from Müsch was driving her car on the outer ring road in Kempener towards Grefrath at around 9.15 p.m.
When she tried to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the 37-year-old's oncoming car.
The vehicles collided.
The Aachen man suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Konstanz: Closure after accident at Schänzle roundabout
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town in the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße at around 8pm on Thursday evening.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was in the left-hand lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right-hand lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old from Konstanz driving there.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old man driving a BMW was also damaged.
A total of around 15,000 property damage was reported, police said.
The carriageway had to be closed while the accident was investigated, it added.
Vienna International Airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements such as these will no longer be available at Vienna International Airport.
This eliminates the majority of loudspeaker announcements - the noise level is thus to be significantly reduced.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna International Airport is following an international trend by stopping announcements that affect individuals.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai, among others, are already dispensing with the noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls ring out through the loudspeakers in one day - is intended to make things quieter at the airport in future.
"Experience has also shown that these individual announcements were relatively little noticed, but at the same time all other information on changed boarding gates or departure times is somewhat lost here," Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling brake cars with tractors, there will also be a second competition at the Agricultural Autumn Festival at Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, 7 September, the Highlander Games start at 1.30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but on the Kaltenhof they have a Swabian touch.
Teams and individual competitors compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It does not depend on the breadth," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown off vertically, should roll over once and then come straight to rest.
This is rated with the most points.
Horseshoe throwing depends on the accuracy of the target.
A peg is thrown from eight metres away.
Participants have to prove their skill and strength in carrying water buckets over 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team two may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
Training can already be done from 10 am.
Matching clothing is desired, for example, competitors can compete in a tartan skirt.
But Swabian costumes are also permitted.
The jury will award a few bonus points for the "outfit."
Registration is possible up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evenings, the brass band friends get their money's worth.
At 7pm, the Birabohemian brass music from Schiltach will set up the big entertainment evening.
The band plays brisk polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as a singing innkeeper and baron of black sausages from Weilen unter den Rinnen, will be there.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Jester's Guild.
On Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for a morning drink, from 2 pm the farmer's band Böffingen is a guest, and the "oldies" round off the festival.
The prelude is already on Friday the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other events on the programme on Saturday and Sunday include the Oldtimer and Tugboat Meeting, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the corn maze, the craft market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the "Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle," the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele."
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with vegetable cream, for example, is a substitute for curd cheese.
Further calls the vegetarian federation to the world vegan day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the Vegetarierbund Deutschland proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt can be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Whipped vegetable cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
You can also use 50 grams of applesauce or one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds plus three tablespoons of water.
Loose batter instead of using egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of cornstarch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to data of the Vebu approximately 800 000 humans live at present in Germany vegan, thus purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Schwarzwald-Gymnasium got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we immediately set off for the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here, a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered, which in the evening light is a special attraction.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep," the day in Times Square was decided.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot on the second day.
Then we went through the financial center to Wall Street to the 9 / 11 memorial.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the observation deck of the Empire State Building, which is 373 metres high, while enjoying the view.
Afterwards we drove through the hustle and bustle of the streets of New York via Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and are experiencing everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus mass will be celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe der Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth performs on parforce horns (natural horns in the E flat tuning) based on old, originally French melodies.
The brass players wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and pack of dogs on tow hunts.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 a.m.
The redesigned Opschlag shines with a new café.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the encyclopaedia, déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve, within sight of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, the pure feeling of déjà vu does not have to stop there.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has just that goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but tangibly, repeatedly experienceable.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A glance at the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team, headed by founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner, spoils guests with a wide variety of coffee or cocktails.
Delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes accompany the meal.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves as restaurateurs even before the opening of the smart café at Opschlag: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge."
The likeable cafe-lovers are hoping for more audiences from the move to Kleve to the Opschlag.
Not least by the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two would like to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The friendly owners are behind the enjoyment of coffee.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew itself in a variety of variations.
Express fan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette to go with it - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
There were already two events in the bright café.
Or rather, one.
Because the harbour festival tended to take place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also Ringelnatzabend.
The two 33-year-olds found it "beautiful, successful and funny."
But not everyone's cup of tea.
Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of event evenings: "You can't please everyone."
And with an event I only address those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events tend to be the exception to the rule.
"We want to disrupt normal operations as little as possible."
That is to say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, guests from near and far and students who discover the Gastromeile and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV had invited "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club bar of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness under the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the appropriate celebration for honours.
Secretary Rolf Wagener was pleased to receive the special "Singer of the Year" award.
"Not only did you write down a lot for us, but you also did a lot of rounds for us, for which we sincerely thank you," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the prizes for participating in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of bouquets of activity went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Fifth place went to music attendant Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was extended to the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again conjured up a first-class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club pub.
"We welcome new voices who enjoy singing at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Poverty Reduction Goals
The United Nations is now starting to draw up a set of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction announced 12 years ago.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These targets will build on our progress under the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
Even though SG Achim / Baden has been without a win for four days, the mood in the handball league continues to be good.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I certainly don't know what such a victory tastes like anymore," Malmon expects a feeling of success from his team in VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third division reserve team from Fredenbeck has not yet uprooted any trees, Malmon raises his index finger in the run-up to the game.
I coached a lot of players myself when I was a youth.
That is why they will surely be particularly motivated against their former coach.
"In addition, it remains to be seen whether there will be reinforcements from the first team," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally get back on the road to success, the Malmon team definitely has to improve compared to the previous performances.
Above all in the covering work and in the switching play it lacked lately nevertheless enormously.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
So I hope my players finally get their heads clear during the short break.
Security Concerns Grow in Mozambique as Clashes Between Influential Personalities
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founder and first president, to call for peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the country's future, she swapped her business clothes for a T-shirt that read "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts say the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of vast offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni, and the United States "Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo alleges that the government provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations, and to do so in earnest," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) banging their heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reform, has already said it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has launched disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south link.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo but home to Beira, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended rail use for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga responded cautiously when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people are already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life," an author says.
The Thor stories showed that "brute force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrated how important it was to have a dream.
But many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," which is why Crossley-Holland called for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are "overly didactic," children "completely switch off" because the messages are conveyed "subliminally" in entertaining stories.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can have certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to communicate hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed by history, not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again to Freihof
One hundred years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof."
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scenery.
From his arrival and the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobactor Alois Kraftzcyk had devised an entertaining piece, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time leaps from youth to imminent retirement.
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his childhood heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his prime role as the great son of the city.
He rode the two-horse horse and "Black Forest foxes" of Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach in true style.
He was not only received with a lot of applause by the audience, but also welcomed by his sister Philippine.
Billy Sum-Hermann knew incredibly well how to put himself in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbach peasant band played suitably selected pieces of music, rounding off the performance.
The mayor of Haslach, Heinz Winkler, who represented the then incumbent, Mr Hättich, together with a part of the city council, paid his respects to the honorary citizenship.
Afterwards, the Epiphany singers paid their respects, prompting Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, my own Epiphany memories come back to life."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the courtyard as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out."
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of the war.
In the homeland earth, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home for good," it said at the end of the scene.
Plenty of applause and words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: Hopes grow for Neckar Giants
The chances to stay in the league of the relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketballers have increased.
If there is a wildcard process, the Neckar giants will now have one less competitor.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible rematch.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national team player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first sigh of relief was nonetheless not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it was clear that Düsseldorf would not receive a licence," Neckar-Giants boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Dusseldorf Baskets has until 23 May to submit documents to the Court of Arbitration and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the Rhinelanders have been denied their licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Church of the Last Supper comes into focus
As the city's contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the Culture and Tourism Office is dedicating the last of this year's public themed tours to the Church of the Communion on Sunday, 27 October.
After visiting the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule, will be considered.
The culmination is a visit to the Church of the Last Supper.
There, the participants are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the view of the Last Supper, painted by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter, is also noticeable in the church.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milan original by Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the one and a half hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller-Museum.
Tickets are available at the box office of the Atomkellermuseum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is at your disposal for questions and information.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also testify in the US spying affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing unspecified sources familiar with the situation.
Such an issue could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually ruled out.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden faces extradition there, it said.
Long Breathing Pays Off
Six men's teams competed for the title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier / Bronner team decided the final match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf received a dream weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with each team playing against each other.
The game was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the trusted hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were level on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the trophy to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the home straight.
The second place went to the double Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze podium.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend in August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday programme for a colourful children's and family festival with numerous participatory activities and events.
"Both adults and children can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release says.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
Regional craftsmen are on hand to help the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
There is also a trade union in the museum workshop.
During the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or rotors, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games promise a lot of fun, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt walking.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock respectively.
On a cross-country tour, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be joking with the museum guests from 11 am.
In the meantime, things are cosy and fairytale-like with Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broommaker, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker will be looking over their shoulders at their traditional work.
A varied holiday programme awaits visitors to the open-air museum until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is regarded as a lovable codger, because he has decided to take part in a race in America on his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt is undeterred by his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he moves to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there will be coffee, tea and cake.
Shrill beeping bothers residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbine logistics.
The coal shimmers black on the storage site in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dumps and return chargers distribute or load the coal here as required.
Every time the cargo handling equipment moves, a loud warning sound is heard over the area.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is widely heard in unfavourable winds - and so there have already been some complaints from people in the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept quieter with technical measures.
He also relies on an open dialogue with the neighbours in the future.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the extension of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the major players in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the recessed reclining tub in front of the terminal, capesize bulk carriers can now also be handled here.
"This year, we want to break the 3 million tonne mark in handling," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to inland power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant were to be connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge, as well as the second conveyor belt, could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball players optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us from believing that we can win against the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic summed up after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday night at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich, too!
In only their third appearance in the European premier league, the Munich team sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear-headed enough in the decisive phases.
The visitors managed to turn a 15-point deficit into a lead with 13 minutes to go before Piraeus turned the game around again.
"We fought back unbelievably against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made reckless mistakes," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We pride ourselves on our performance but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munich team, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a confectioner at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to perform at a club," Hirsch said.
We conceived this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual musical and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring performances by Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
As the festival has grown, so has the world of comedy.
A number of the comedians taking part in this year's festival have become known through more unconventional channels, such as shows on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his name with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell, who focuses on racial issues) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the alleyway between two buildings and thinks to himself: Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear talks
One week before the next nuclear meeting, Iran has expressed satisfaction with the five UN veto powers and Germany with the negotiation process.
"After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
There would still be a long way to go, but the chief nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and optimistic that both sides would eventually reach a solution.
Uruguay drama: Boys kill playmates with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two boys, aged 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird-hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and dumped his body in a well, El País newspaper reported on Thursday.
They would then play football in front of their homes in a working-class neighbourhood.
The body was found the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger one, who had taken her with her, was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the incident to police without mentioning any assault against her, the two boys admitted the premeditated killing of the 11-year-old.
The elder cited a rivalry in football as one of the reasons.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric juvenile facility.
Pimp must go to jail
The District Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
According to this, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the income of the women, some of whom worked for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he cut off the women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them monitored in part to control their earnings.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues died next to him in an explosion in Afghanistan.
The 33-year-old made a wide-ranging confession after a psychiatric expert raised serious doubts about his mental retardation and thus his ability to plead guilty.
The court did not have to hear from any of the injured women.
According to a detective, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking have been identified after an initial complaint was made through telephone surveillance.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by high levels of aggression.
In later interrogations the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, who said one of the women had bruises all over her body, has yet to give evidence.
He said he was "a completely broken person" who saw violence and exploitation in the profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He broke away from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after his imprisonment," he said.
Oil price falls further to $96 a barrel
Oil prices also fell further on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The benchmark crude for December delivery fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning electronic trading in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, marking a 5.8 percent drop in prices in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Supply had risen by 25 million barrels in five weeks.
But on Friday there were signs of stronger demand, with two reports showing an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery in China's economy, which grew to 7.8% in the third quarter, after falling to its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
Court Blocks NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk Decision
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked a judge's order demanding changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program, freeing the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be put on hold pending an appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by the way it implemented the program for stopping and questioning people.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist police in amending its policy and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday for the requested suspension.
The appellate report said that the judge should be exonerated from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Latino men through the Stop and Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to oversee the implementation of key changes, including policy reforms, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot program of body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most inspections were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after police inspections.
A hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Checks of this kind have come in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded checks rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 during the tenure of nonpartisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg, most of them black and Latino men.
In 2004, four men, all from minorities, filed what became a class-action lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police departments use the system.
Opponents say the changes will dampen police morale, but not crime, waste money and fail to solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but merely reforming the way the NYPD handles checks.
The Luck of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands."
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself visited Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, a further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous surgeries on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the aforementioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Patrol vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former mayor of Nagold, had made the suggestion to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to become active at the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry shop from Baiersbronn built the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Hen also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be disengaged.
One learns a lot in Africa as a doctor, Henne says, for example slowing down against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to undertake as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to spend time here in various areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, including medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and goggles in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling stories from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into mobile goat barns and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their trip to Mauritania.
He cited his work in auditing as one of his personal motivations as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Furthermore, Fuchtel emphasized that global economy also requires global love of humanity.
Nor should we forget that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and pursued her, but Coulson also called her and left messages, the court heard.
"According to the prosecution, Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is not someone who stands in front of people's homes hoping to catch them in the act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW used three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second one, surveillance, it can't be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He denies this, but we say: "And if he knew about it."
Rumours of Clarke's affair were first picked up by the NotW editorial board when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
During the time the research was ongoing, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail saying: "I have a story we are going to publish tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis said Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other key figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he was in a relationship with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
French football will indeed stage its first strike since 1972 in protest at the proposed wealth tax.
A conciliation meeting comes to an inconclusive end.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into an impasse after a failed conciliation meeting.
President Francois Hollande received club and association representatives at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
But he refused to exempt football from the planned 75 per cent levy on income of more than one million euros a year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014.
The opposition, too, remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried through, announced the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The matches in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between 29 November and 2 December will therefore be cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants came to the community hall to have the planned measures explained to them, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring in ideas.
"The final decisions will be made by the members of the local council," he said.
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, said Häußler.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many built-up plots as possible," says Häußler.
The planning is based on the protection against a flood, which according to the German Weather Service is statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent surcharge.
Experts refer to this as "HQ 100aKlima."
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can make a relative improvement," he said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros will have to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can count on state subsidies of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the funding only existed if an overall concept was implemented.
In order to do this, the municipality relies on the participation of the citizens.
A time-consuming planning and approval process had to be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the local council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, questions were raised as to why more dams and reservoirs were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the contracted engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasised that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal overall.
Furthermore, Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe said, it is important to find the most economical solution.
Anger reigned among residents of the old village, who have to suffer again and again from an overload of the sewer network even during normal thunderstorms.
The problem is well known to the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
However, he pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems were different from those for flood defences and that this should not be mixed up.
The municipality is obliged to design the sewer network in such a way that two to three years of rain events can be tolerated.
Making the sewers bigger would devour millions.
Seriously injured after collision
Early on Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf.
Police immediately closed the road completely, but were initially unable to comment on the cause of the accident.
However, there were various eyewitness testimonies, which were to be evaluated first.
What is certain is that the 19-year-old female driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came towards her in his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman trapped so badly that it took firefighters just under half an hour to free her from the wreckage of the vehicle.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both casualties were taken to nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
One could call him the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, and his novels and stories have something serial about them.
The kinship on the outside is astonishing: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet who is certainly valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, which distributes the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, safety mania, and the belief that you are chosen.
Dick had experiences of God; his late books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was mad, drugs had damaged his brain.
He realized early on that the calculators are divinity.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is especially significant now.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956 and exudes the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
Here, the principle of "pre-crime" is being developed, "pre-crime," that is, what has become more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick's world, which is frighteningly similar to ours, mutants look to the future - and the police intervene.
"We record individuals who have not broken any laws," the agency's chief said.
'We snatch them before they can commit a violent crime, 'he said.
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, instead we have a penal camp full of pesudo criminals." They read currents of time.
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's narrative acts as the blueprint for anti-terror laws and NSA wiretapping.
Anticipating the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story doesn't end there.
The police chief complains that there is no longer any separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system goes crazy.
It's perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only accepts mistakes and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means, again and again, getting closer to the truth.
Spying on Merkel to testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also testify in the US spying affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum case.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.
Earlier in the day, Green Party member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to discuss the affair.
NSA revelations add to corporate paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BAT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he was asked to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-former employee, began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have driven corporate paranoia about government surveillance to a new high.
The straw that broke the camel's back was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data could be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultancy EY.
The documents leaked by Snowden, however, have so far provided no evidence that the US has passed on foreign companies "trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
It was proposed in the Bundestag that we should set up a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, we should not have allowed it to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and agriculture.
Everything, except the IT industry.
Still, the reach and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major shift because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to US jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, in the wake of revelations about US data-mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, said: "We're seeing a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
This has always been the case.
"It has been an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate leaders don't usually brag about the countermeasures they have taken, because that gives attackers an advantage.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick to a trade fair or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access," the BAT warns in a report.
The US warns its own firms against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia, and Israel second only to China among countries that used hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's domestic intelligence agency, DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
A special trade fair in the Domäne in Hechingen gave tips on how to at least celebrate a wedding.
Important providers around a wedding were represented.
One trend: the retro look is back.
It starts with wedding dresses, for example.
White is a must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses, which are often ruffled and embroidered, are closed, often with a veil; at the back, however, they go down the back and often end in a train.
However, as Stefanie Koch from the fashion house Kleidermüller points out, there are differences of opinion.
For men, the suit with waistcoat and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The selection of the restaurant was important, it was explained.
Undecorated adjacent rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the carriage house.
Uwe Link has an offer for those who want to ride in a carriage.
"Coaches are also popular for stag parties," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitations, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
Increasingly fashionable is the "after-wedding photo" - i.e. shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented at the Domain on Sunday.
Floral arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and even a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dog lovers successful
Once again, the sportsmen of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he made it to twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp faced the critical eyes of the performance judge with her Woody in the class 1.
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym are convinced their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat behind the bleachers in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubts that.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he had died as the sheriff concluded.
"They think it defies logic, violates the laws of physics, and violates common sense," Crump said.
On the contrary, they were convinced that the truth was being covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Her son went to school to study and came back in a body bag," he says.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death because a number of important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death a crime?
Moore said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
A second autopsy, however, revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative for the county sheriff's office was not immediately available for comment when contacted on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues as to how he died.
CDC issues allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with children's food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness among faculty and staff about food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools stock epinephrine - the EpiPen brand is the most commonly used auto-injection - to counter a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.
State lawmakers recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to stock epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms cited by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is a hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender indefinitely"
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third sex for children born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare gender for such children, but will be able to indicate "indeterminate" or "unspecified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to relieve pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding gender reassignment surgery for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
Years later, according to the BBC, an intersex person said: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children is born neither as a boy nor a girl each year.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
Understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that if a determination is not possible, the best available information on gender assignment should be used, rather than waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding on surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but that's not the case for most children," he said.
One could perform a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity in the first place is not very accurate.
No one knows why it is happening.
It's like the secret to why people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission in 2011 stated that intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not based on gender, but on their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both at the same time or not clearly as one.
These characteristics manifested themselves in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, in subordinate sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit the gender stereotype now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to state male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognised as the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted lifelong retention of an "unspecified" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the staunchly Catholic country signed a petition calling for "gender theory" to be removed from textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, arguing that "if the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilisation."
The mother of a Maryland newborn told Baby Zone that she thinks it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Being a parent is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now that it is known how complex gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child will feel growing up with the gender they assign, the ethical foundations of surgery are in doubt.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity," arguing that social and environmental impulses - how parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones, shaping whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John / Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990 "s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex surgeries went public who were" not happy with the outcome. "
Take Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should have a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he requested his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised at birth - and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with DSD, which meant his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation rendered him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the law could "encourage stigma and stigma."
"Many campaigners are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a child 'not fixed'," she said.
We fear that this encourages intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as the third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she said.
The German law is about assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to be forced upon young children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual discrimination disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says the law "empowers" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Katie is now 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male" or "female."
That way, everything is fine - you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy parenthood.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that parents feel because they don't think they are doing the right thing," she said.
Ultimately, it is the child who decides on the sex that suits them best - and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown injures girl by shooting from car
Unknown persons have injured a 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt when shots were fired from a car.
The perpetrators were believed to have fired an airgun at a group of children in Geneva on Thursday night.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl suffered minor injuries to her left calf.
Emergency services took the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The attackers also shot at a bus stop.
A pane shattered.
Then they drove off.
Forensic police are investigating, it said on Friday.
So far, Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officers were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house fronts.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains immediately, also no property damage should have developed.
Furthermore, some firecrackers were detonated in the city area, but also here no damage was caused.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his bicycle covers were stolen.
However, by the time police arrived the man had retrieved his bicycle visors in the immediate vicinity, so police did not have to take any further action.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders?" Waltraud Ries asks, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for some time now for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and the flat in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the woman in her mid-fifties has had to experience first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
She recently published a book entitled 'Living happily in old age - Which form of living is best for me?'.
'Our flat is the best example of what can't be done in old age, 'she begins.
When she and her husband moved into the duplex more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, in her mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who actually deal with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most crowd it out as long as they can.
Only the others get old, 'she says with a grin.
Only when the suffering is really great do you start to think about it.
'By then, however, it may already be too late, 'Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'But which type of home you choose is always an individual decision, 'she explains.
T he solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also fall ill.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the local language, you can also live in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the textbook advises people willing to resettle.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often-cited pensioner flatshare.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and quirks
'For me, sharing a flat would be nothing, 'she says with a twinkle in her eye.
Especially not like in a student shared flat with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
'As you get older, you just need your retreats, 'Ries said.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a shared apartment for senior citizens can still work.
But then this had to be done differently than in the classical student flat share.
And sometimes you just want your peace and quiet, 'she believes.
With this opinion, she is not alone, at least in the state capital.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own homes as long as possible, 'is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civic service Life in the Age of the State Capital.
Her department advises people on the subject of 'getting older'.
For this reason, especially older people would often put up with inconveniences and restrictions just to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings - that is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends everyone who is concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly first and not to order the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rented apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment according to age and thus barrier-free, no matter how beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries had to go through this experience.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
She is more scared of moving house than she is of the spider on her apartment door.
US to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of illegally passing on classified information.
As a result, he must face criminal proceedings in the United States, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Nor would Snowden's recent comments change that.
Earlier, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel's remarks were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German member of the government.
Intelligence leaker Edward Snowden is prepared to talk to German authorities in principle.
First, however, he wants his situation clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the USA in an unaddressed letter, which the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
According to a translation circulated by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To those responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was formerly employed by contract or direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of publishing these concerns, I was subjected to a serious and sustained smear campaign that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have viewed the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that holds no one accountable as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of fidelity and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will put an end to this harmful attitude.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and lawfully in the responsible clarification of the facts relating to the statements made in the media, in particular as regards the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved, and I thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor, Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private individual.
The sale was approved by the local council at its most recent meeting in the non-public sector.
The building changed hands at a "reasonable" price.
"The congregation is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This expenditure is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Court Concert at High Summer Temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the Gasthof Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the musicians from Hammrich.
The chairperson Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully master the first hock of musicians.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton during the 2012 campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited book about the 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times has a copy of the soon-to-be-published book, and reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers conducted "extensive group meetings and surveys in late 2011" to determine whether Obama's fading re-election hopes would be better off if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for The Times, the book thoroughly chronicles the efforts of senior campaign and White House aides, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the effect on poll numbers of swapping former Secretary Clinton for the vice president.
The potential switch has been a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only a half-dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden despite their "close, personal relationship," before eventually deciding against such a move after data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
'I said a lot of things that should be considered and that was one of them, 'Daley told the magazine.
It's worth remembering that the president had terrible poll numbers back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley called the investigation "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that significant efforts had been made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
"Campaigns don't spend that much money on polls and focus groups unless you think seriously about something," Martin explained on AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
While Daley said he did not believe the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the policy probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the investigation into whether Biden should be dropped in the election.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
When designing the Internet service e-mail, was the secrecy of correspondence implemented in a similar way to conventional mail?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have failed to provide a stable basis for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni," are the computers of the two connected directly?
In the first step, Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
Along the way, the mail can pass through several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorised persons reading an e-mail is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or take note of e-mails.
Then there are the possible illegal spying operations.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even readily possible to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 study by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the predominantly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo-Mail's shares had recently fallen, Google's GMail gained significantly.
Mother buried in forest and receives pension
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
In order to be able to collect further pension and care money, a 67-year-old from Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after investigations of the police in the forest.
He initially covered up the 89-year-old's death, then pocketed the money for more than a year and a half.
The 67-year-old now faces charges of fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it was noticeable that no more medications were needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told investigators his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because it seemed strange to the officers, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and that he had last looked after them.
The 67-year-old eventually admitted the death of his mother.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime, according to police.
Fancy ice cream glowing in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals to create a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and being able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
When eaten, the ice cream reacts with the tongue, which raises the pH value in the protein and causes it to glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows - so the more you lick, the lighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: 'The product is incredible, but it's still very early in production, so you get two grams of it for £200.'
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth heats up the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have been testing it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental Bristol-based company is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is set to be even more ambitious.
He says: 'I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream.'
This is impossible in itself because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially created by Chinese scientists
TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball-Verband-Liga after six days of play.
Now, of all times, Ingo Ehlers "team will face TSV Daverden tomorrow in the derby, which celebrated its first victory last weekend.
This game is a new start to the season for us.
"I hope we can finally clear our heads," Ehlers is cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete squad at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden also relies on tempo.
We therefore need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase coverage, which has recently left a far from certain impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is considerably more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're far from the favourite, because anything can happen in a derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to hang up his boots in Morsum to start a series.
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this the A-youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with the A-youth league HC Bremen with double playing rights, celebrates his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, there was something magical about Halloween.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more of a Halloween muffin.
For the past two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I do not think I will do so this year.
But according to the statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be precise - are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retailers Federation (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend figures.
The costumes will account for about $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, they can now embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect plenty of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into their Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise we were not alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who roam the neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, chanting "Trick or Treat."
In fact, we will buy and - make no mistake - eat over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugary Candy Corn, yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That is about nine billion maize kernels.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
There are, in fact, 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos of you peeing in your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook where you can't get rid of them, and then the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like "nice face."
But let's get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we did from an early age.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin rather than sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, is believed to have originated in Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you really want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and carve something pretty out of their 921-pound pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescuers recover charred body
The fire brigade had to move out of Helmbrechts late on Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the county of Hof caught fire on Friday night.
Rescuers recover a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmand province.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
By late Thursday evening, there had been a fire on the ground floor of the house.
By the time the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already pounding out of a window.
Emergency services went to the flat and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
For the time being, the building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not immediately clear.
Germany's largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030.
For today's young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the regional church has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-ecclesiasticisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can set my priorities where they are important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could easily make a living from it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for that theologians have a secure employer.
This would suit the young people of today, who are not only interested in careers, but in meaningful work.
According to the regional church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time about 40 graduates of a theology course begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz Mountains, the Emsland Mountains or the Wendland, it could become difficult to fill vacancies in the future.
Burfien intends, among other things, to organize study days for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad formation.
You can even become Federal President with it.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior includes racing seats and six-point belts, as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support, to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and an accessible route to world-class events.
We are pleased to be opening this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the rigors and realities of rally raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it's going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge includes a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to take part in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a pooch stuck 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor road accident
Three days later she was discovered in her predicament by a walker in the quarry
Firefighters abseiled down a cliff face and saved the dog from certain death
The fire brigade managed to bring a puppy to safety, which was stuck on a 15-metre high ledge in a rock face.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived on her own for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to pick up Ruby and thank the firefighters from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for her missing dog and posted cries for help on social media after she ran into the quarry following the minor road accident.
At about 2.15pm on Wednesday, a walker walking his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre heel in the quarry.
Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby, who was then carried up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist from the technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen stiff.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
It was a pretty unusual deployment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: 'Ruby was very lucky.'
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination but nothing was found except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: 'Watching the rescue was scary.'
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in my arms again.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and she had collapsed, she would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each one of them has been absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson, from Keighley, added: 'We were afraid she was going to fall down but she stayed up.'
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a backing singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry explained that she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that 'he hooked me up when I was 18.'
She added: 'That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me.'
In a statement on Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies that he ever made any inappropriate advances to Katy Perry."
The rep added: 'Maybe she mistook him for someone else.'
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," went straight to No 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This is the cue for stories of passport checks in Berwick and a barbed wire-fenced border along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde submission highlighted the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not make the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing to ignore Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what they really want from the Scots.
Not a story, really.
And one that has grown to resemble a fossil: the first time I heard "independence means passport control" duck was at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point gets lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why would an independent Scotland be expected to dance to the tune of Europe?
Why swap the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
Across the EU, anti-EU parties are gaining ground, or seeking to jettison the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded only this year - won nearly five million votes in September's federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of Britain's Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, is turning out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket into which each national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and German politicians would like to keep that the way it is.
Without the possibility of a local currency depreciation, southern Europe finds itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending, spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen at Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is looming, especially in France, the EU's erstwhile cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for holding Germany in check and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, with which the struggling French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote - a timely warning for Britain's Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right would automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newfound popularity among white working-class Frenchmen?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-single currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then, for the first time, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of cozying up to the US.
But Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can choose to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put their money where their mouth is.
I suspect Scotland could do quite well in a looser European grouping, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider following Norway's lead and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 by rejecting the proposed (and implemented) cuts that Labour's Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have austerity policies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls are more likely to reach puberty than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the epidemic of obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter has breasts and pubic hair growing from the age of seven or eight?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference this week in Orlando, Fla., pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - normally that's not a sign that puberty is fast approaching," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, there has been only a slight shift in menarche age (onset of first menstruation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least another two to three years for the menarche to develop," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Addressing this Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is debatable what constitutes the onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates - something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If it progresses more quickly, tests by an endonologist could be appropriate to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and to ward off another consequence: premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about medication, but he concedes, "Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls" feelings of being different from their peers. "
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter got her days when she was ten.
Even though there were early signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home from school scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys reach puberty earlier than girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported a 2001 study of girls aged six to nine that established a link between body fat and the onset of puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors at play.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls are more likely to reach puberty than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another conundrum is that although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlighted the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We have to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who blossom early need reassurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in face of big orders
A row has broken out between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute centres on the width of seats offered to passengers on long, tourist-class flights - not always the ones airlines are most concerned about, but this designated space is key to claims of efficiency on Airbus SAS and Boeing Co's newest aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46cm (18 inches) in tourist class, but US arch-rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute comes as aircraft makers compete to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the November 17-21 event.
The design of the rear of the aircraft - particularly whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the reported economic results that the new "mini jumbo" design is expected to deliver.
Boeing claims its upgraded "777X" can hold 406 people in tourist-class seats that are more than 17 inches wide, allowing for ten in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in tourist class, with nine in each row.
Aviation giants often dish out blows over technical details through advertising in the trade press.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to top the list with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing backers a picture of three people squashed up in a restaurant with the caption: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus chief sales officer John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people are getting fatter, but plane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to US health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, research has been carried out showing that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat sizes, saying it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance airfare and furnishings.
The company also says that research shows that the experience on an aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more elbow room, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least $700 billion after list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, to the original design of nine seats on the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for presses with ten seats per row currently in use.
"Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say full ten-seat-per-row cabins on existing 777s suggest that many passengers are opting for the narrower configuration, which could come with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is, from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, cabin furnishings expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet salesmen even carry tape measure with them to measure the furnishings with the competition.
Even if they prioritise comfort, all manufacturers also offer high density jets for low cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but says it has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the importance of more cabin adaptability and offered wide aisle seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle out, but could distract from the surge in 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More trials are needed before human testing, which could take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy may one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, using all the methods available on the market, but have found that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal levels of activity.
Mice without the vaccine, on the other hand, took a "time-out," the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is completely safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thereby preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to quit.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them quit the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but warned more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi is under investigation by the state's corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies changing maritime lease arrangements at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had an undercover interest in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to renew leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without bidding after they expired in August 2005.
An investigation is now under way into allegations that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the properties after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole gave evidence on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases on the Circular Quay businesses, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally supported public procurement.
But he denied he had made the changes at the request of Obeid, who Tripodi confirmed had pushed for a shake-up of the government's lease arrangements.
A telephone transcript submitted to ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Department after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Department.
"Was the issue discussed in those phone conversations the elaboration of commercial lease arrangements?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes strike target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets struck a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not elaborate on what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign workers on 457 visas as part of expanded measures.
If the test is introduced, it would apply a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was published today after former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers, saying they could be seen as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners should queue up' and 'Australians first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions were calling for a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant protecting white workers - and if some in the region heard an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The proposal outlines 12 measures once mooted by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, with others still under consideration.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be verified that "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or relevant person of the supporting company."
Firms could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The distraught nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him is being cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat following his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been announced by the UK Government.
HS2 Ltd's work proposes to build high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England as soon as Phase 1 begins in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to work with the UK Government on the plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2 is completed, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look at further route capacity and travel time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
These include the possibility of travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are going ahead with HS2 because it has huge benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis on our rail network.
But it is also about connecting 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but at the same time the economic clout of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners with the UK Government to explore options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will deliver benefits for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with UK ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices on planes remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will continue to have to turn off tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their policies so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided they are in "flight mode."
Passengers are already allowed to do so for most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are watching the decision, which US airlines have a lot of work to do to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their rules.
Air traffic control agency CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight remained in place in Australia.
"CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
The issue is governed by rules requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, saying it is open to changes but they must be initiated by lawmakers.
"We would welcome a review of CASA's approval of electronic devices as we believe this would improve the customer experience now that we are offering (in-flight wireless entertainment)," a spokesman said.
Qantas said it would stick with the current rules until further notice.
"Our current policies state that electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no plans at this time to change this," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of the decision on US airlines varies according to the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and modify manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, when visibility is poor, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended stowing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the local derby against Schalke, BVB supporters with flares had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before Friday's Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which was offered to the spectator until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna Park.
The guest fans with their chants were predominantly to be heard.
The Südtribüne, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, was at first exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, who otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stands, a large flag with the inscription "stadium ban section" was waving lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to enter the pitch, there was a brief cheer.
As his team-mates followed, there were loud chants and waving scarves - but nowhere near everywhere.
Nothing moved in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand.
Even the fact that stadium announcer Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jurgen Klopp - did not cause a celebratory mood.
Only five minutes before kick-off, the Capo climbed to his podium - and the tension, which had been palpable with his hands until then, erupted into a loud scream as Dickel, as usual, surveyed the atmosphere in the stands in the stadium.
As always, the South Stand was the last stand - and finally, as usual, it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came from the South Stand with the kick-off, everything was as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the local derby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB supporters had fired flares into the stands and onto the pitch - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the leaders of the Dortmund ultras in his office afterwards - and if Watzke's words are believed, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the supporters "representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras to perform a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he said.
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
The ultras were also shown various options for punishment - they now have until Tuesday to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will decide on a sanction by the end of next week.
"It's going to be drastic," Watzke said.
It will be interesting to see how the reactions in the South Stand turn out.
Pawnshops are booming in Singapore as the crisis hits the middle class
At a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bangle, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for her daughters "school fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) a month as an administrative assistant and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, such is demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where it exchanged, became the third pawn shop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Paying for jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - $1,300 Singapore dollars in Janani Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% charged by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans can be made faster than with banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit owing to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to make up the difference when the economy stutters.
This week, ratings agency Standard & Poor's cited growing household debt, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor to Asian banks "credit worthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt to GDP ratios in Asia, according to the agency.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week.
Data on Thursday showed continued export weakness and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that as costs rise, people in the middle to lower end (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have amplified the trend toward pawning personal belongings, as people seize the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city-state's 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
Thailand's largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 per cent increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia - where the company has four stores - but also outside Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's managing director.
The company is financing this with 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it raised with the Singapore IPO this week.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offer cheaper rates than other lenders, but also don't directly increase debt.
"Customers lend out items they already own, and liquidating personal valuables doesn't add to household debt," she explains.
Pawnshops are increasingly accepted by society as short-term, hedged financing.
Not all pawnbrokers are in financial trouble, either.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"These include affluent people who borrow in the short term for a business or investment, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA siphons off data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to solve the increasingly explosive NSA spying affair.
According to Green member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence officer would testify at a German prosecutor's office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama."
325 million Australian dollars bail-out for Tasmanian health system
The Australian government is insisting on the tough conditions attached to the $325 million bailout of Tasmania's health service to ensure the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has said the Commonwealth would take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by the island state's ageing population, higher rates of chronic illness and systemic constraints.
The four-year funding was agreed after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency election assistance.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and cataracts treatments, are to be carried out to remove residues.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-hospital follow-up, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected hospital staff have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian government.
The federal government would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and report monthly on where the extra money has been spent.
A three-member commission will be established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "it is not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable course."
Nonetheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal funding will go a long way to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election benefits will largely offset the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton says today's announcement is just a "sticking plaster solution."
"We are in the current situation because the Labor state government has taken $430 million out of the health system," he told ABC TV.
It is unacceptable for a state government to take almost half a billion dollars out of the system and put 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend it is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on extra bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier fare than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, it tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never slips into lustfulness or sensationalism - and therein lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it an agonizing penitence for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, a monitoring group says
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and ammunition manufacturing facilities, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while heavy clashes erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day ahead of the deadline on
1 November, which the Damascus-based Organisation, based in The Hague, had set to destroy or render "inoperable" all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
There are believed to be around 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time of fighting in the town of Safira on Thursday, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, he said, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have links to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors, whose mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the key production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites identified by Damascus.
Two facilities could not be visited because of safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC said the two sites had been "abandoned... and the chemical weapons program assets there have been moved to other designated facilities that have been inspected," according to Syria's statement.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of two facilities the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC executive committee next month.
"I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the monitoring organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, to which many Alawite members belong, a secession of Shiite Islam.
In other developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he said.
Anger over verdict for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict for the last of the instigators to be tried, as they believed Umar Patek should be legally shot.
Patek, who had been on the run for almost a decade as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted people, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in making explosives for the bombing.
He could be released on parole after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
He was also found guilty on a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence, although they could have sought the death penalty for the man, also known as "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb-maker.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with the fact that I won't have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a huge bomb exploded in a pickup truck parked outside the nightclub shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where, just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a rucksack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and 'died' three times while on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the carnage and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the goal of rebuilding ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has caused other people.
The ruling came ahead of the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is being commemorated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his conviction.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but can't make cell phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from take-off to landing, but not make phone calls, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented would depend on the airline, FAA spokesman Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage rules in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among those airlines.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to take it off again until the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the go-ahead.
When entering the landing area, passengers must turn it off again and must not take it off again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft modified to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Flight Attendants Association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regime is safely implemented - and we are working closely with the airline on this - both sides will benefit," said Glading.
Frankly, we are tired of feeling like watchdogs on this issue.
However, internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained banned, the authority said.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was forced to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, must continue to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during flight will also remain prohibited.
Phone calls are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert, told CBS News that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cellphones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially interfere with navigation devices, but because we at the FCC know that airborne transmission can also interfere with transmission towers," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue recommended last month that the government allow broader use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on use has increased in recent years.
Critics, such as Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, say there are no valid safety grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget to turn off the device or ignore it.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of passenger-carried FM radios interfering with navigation and communications equipment, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers when they reach altitude for several years.
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you turn the page.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Advocates for easing restrictions on passenger device use include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to detect problems, but could not find any.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he believed the disruption caused by the devices was genuine, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only sporadic reports of pilots arguing for aircraft systems to be disrupted by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the devices when landing in low visibility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible adjustment for travelers who would now be well-equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued from North Sea oil rig released by air ambulance
A bird flown to the coast by air ambulance after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild.
The water rake was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the centre, said: 'This water ramp was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe that was held back by the strong winds over the North Sea.'
Apparently the exhausted bird took refuge on the rig.
He added: 'He couldn't fly any further, so we were contacted asking for help.'
When she was released, she was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy together and defining what those who deliver prosperity and jobs in Britain want to change about our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, covering roughly the size, sectors and regions of British business.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, concentrating on countries that are modernising and growing, while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than dwell on the long and arduous process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their views on certain statutory issues - from antitrust law to product legislation - a majority of business leaders believe that control of these key powers should be brought back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, with businesses saying the costs of Brussels rules now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone - even 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
Finally, and probably most importantly, our poll of business leaders found that a clear majority want Britain to move towards a change in the deal, and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This realisation, which can be found among companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring the game back to the UK.
The stakes are high - a change in the deal and better terms for Britain would lead to a 16 per cent swing in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is backing his plan to renegotiate Britain's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that businesses expect a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means more focus for businesses on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller Calls Pipeline in Bulgaria the Beginning of a New Gas Era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Gazprom Board of Directors.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to increase diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is stored for Europe, raises the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes on stream in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction in other subordinate countries on the planned route is scheduled to begin by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The economic fundamentals are right and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets are benefiting from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to other European countries.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out at the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
A look at the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial properties are, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it grew by 31% compared to the same period last year.
The increase was only 6% in the UK and 19% in France.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive return," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices on planes - even though cell phone use remains banned.

Royal Commission hearing: Two YMCA staff charged with sex offences over Jonathan Lord allegations
Two YMCA staff from NSW were charged with child sex offences before allegations were made against Caringbah nanny Jonathan Lord in 2011, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has heard.
But in its opening statement to the commission, the YMCA said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual abuse within the organisation."
Chief executive Phillip Hare was questioned about one case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another in which a PE teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child abuse in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the commission had also been inaccurate in asserting that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognized as being at the forefront of child safety."
On the contrary, evidence before the commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating out of four possible in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August of that year.
Mr O'Hare, who started at the YMCA when he was 21, admitted management had failed "downwards from me" in hiring Lord and failed to ensure staff were aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety guidelines.
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years working for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr O'Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting child safety breaches.
Staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, privately babysitting them, letting them sit on his lap, telling one he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that children's services director Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's supervisor at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very aloof."
The managing director said he would not accept statements from staff that they had not dared report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, her friendship with Lord affected her judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Mr O'Hare said he had communicated his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson the organisation had to learn from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board had agreed.
Mr O'Hare said the decision to press staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by Liam Whitley, chief executive of the YMCA's children's services.
He said this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, but it was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organisation when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Griffith University sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone told the commission.
He said there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, vetting, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the chance to return as British prime minister - but admits a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old shared his views on a range of domestic issues.
Since stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, mostly limiting his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers.
Asked if he would like to return to being prime minister, Blair was quoted by London's Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely to happen, so..."
As horse show experts flocked to Cardiff to pick up the Horse of the Year award, they knew a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The youngster, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds easily to take first prize - leaving 30 adult competitors behind.
The inseparable pair, both equally tall, were praised for their demeanour, demeanour and style at the annual competition, which is hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
He wore his bowler hat at a cheeky angle as he led the two-year-old toffee around the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural ability to handle the pony, which was far beyond his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his demeanour and personality.
Fenton had received toffee as a present for his third birthday last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: 'Fenton and Toffee are a great team.'
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and walked off the pitch with the gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with the Toffees and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy, from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than a decade.
Howells said: 'The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered and clapped for him.'
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to look after.
The way he started, it won't be long before he's on the Horse of the Year show - and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: 'Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony.'
Together they are a great team.
The judges judged Fenton and Toffee on how well they had done and how well they had presented themselves in the show ring.
They look to have a good working relationship between the pony and the leader - and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes did their part to make it a perfect fit for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after appeal
A Chinese newspaper that had called on its front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to falsify reports about a part-state company.
The New Express is now undergoing a "comprehensive rectification," the regulator said.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Guangdong Bureau of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, Neue Express, part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator said in a statement.
She said it was decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter's license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to undertake a full rectification of the New Express and recommended identifying the relevant persons responsible at the New Express and immediately reviewing the management team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting on alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain the public's trust," he told state-run CCTV news channel.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and fame.
I realised I had done the wrong thing.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly verify the reports.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
Drug Tunnel With Own Railway Between U.S. and Mexico Discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail services, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 by 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, zigzagging across nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless nondescript warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected, authorities said.
Eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized when the tunnel was discovered, court records show.
Three men, who authorities say worked as drivers, were charged with possessing and intentionally selling marijuana and cocaine.
If found guilty, they face prison terms ranging from ten years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to drug cartels on how to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a 640-foot-long passageway with rails running from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr plan to go their separate ways in the future.
But in an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about his split from his wife, supermodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, due to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old said.
'We're going to support and love each other as Flynn's parents. '
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to the lexicon, veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism, but differs from this in a very significant way.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a hearty Edam, these treats are not on a vegan's menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides giving up meat and fish, the vegan refrains from eating all animal products - honey is also denied.
Which remains, one may ask oneself, but on closer inspection the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable resourcefulness.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food store, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
Then, at the turn of the century, I took the next step and became a vegan.
"The conviction came not just because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers faux leather to normal leather.
He realized that there are also other everyday concerns without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor says, echoing the vegans "maxim, which applies to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact being vegan is not a renunciation, an asceticism, but an enrichment." The assumption that dietary change reduces the choice of dietary options attributes more to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that caused even the most well-intentioned attempt to fail.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that causes many to give up quickly, much like smoking," Proctor said.
And objected: "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the way of preparation that make the flavour.
"But you can create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, with which it should also taste hearty once in a while.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but it's not just animal food," Proctor said.
He did not suffer health problems, including eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take foreign cholesterol and I have an increased amount of vitamins.
There are high-performance athletes who eat a vegan diet only.
"My blood tests are good, I get checked a lot," Proctor reveals.
Many Vegansimus critics warn in particular about the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed on feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content in the meat you buy in the freezer is high," Proctor says.
For vegans there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 levels are fine," he explains.
Proctor doesn't have to go far to procure food.
After all, staples are everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
Everything I need I can find on site.
Only now and then do I buy something special.
"A lot of people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that is what is known about" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally assumed.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few little tweaks you can get good, if not better, results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonated instead of egg, Proctor could also amaze his in-laws with his vegan cheesecake.
Family celebrations give vegans a new spice.
This has a dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new meaning.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," Proctor says.
Of course, he has already been met with scepticism.
Do you no longer like my food?
"Should I feel bad now, because I drink milk?" - with such questions one has to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
"I'm not rejecting people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to be an enclave.
And if you look more closely, the everyday world does not seem as alien to vegans as you might expect - and vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Fries are everywhere!
"A lot of kebab shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he eschews pasta, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
Restaurants are beginning to adapt to this.
"When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can detect a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there is sufficient demand, they may be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the galley in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes other restaurants will also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the vast majority impossible in the first place," says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan products can be a bit difficult in the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that peanuts can also contain animal additives as colourants, one quickly seems to lose heart when observing ethics in the face of so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and detergents.
"Little by little you develop a scanner view and you know what signs and logos to look out for." Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, "Proctor says.
Veganism is an important moral imperative that strikes a chord with the public.
It may not quite get you to abandon your habits, but at least it can teach consumers to question their habits critically.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers on their toes.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two on the Nasdaq OMX, continued to operate unhindered.
The latest incident continues a series of minor and major glitches at the exchange operator.
As recently as Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August this year there were two breakdowns in one week alone.
At first, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent mass erroneous purchase orders to the options markets because of technical problems.
As a result, exchange operators took almost an entire day to review and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of all US stock trading came to a halt for several hours because of a computer glitch on the Nasdaq exchange.
Facebook's IPO last year also caused a stir.
Nasdaq systems were not up to the flood of buy-and-sell orders, the Securities and Exchange Commission later determined, and fined the company a record $10 million.
Constance: Cyclist kills 63-year-old
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was riding a women's bicycle improperly on the left-hand pavement from Bahnhofplatz towards the market place at around 10pm on Thursday evening.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped from a pub onto the pavement, the cyclist was unable to brake in time, according to police.
In the ensuing collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, fell to the ground and suffered a 15-centimetre gash to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured man to hospital for medical treatment.
British police issue extradition order to Assange
British police today handed over an extradition warrant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had sent the 40-year-old Australian a 'call to surrender' inviting him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply he could face arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on a sex offence charge after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking for political asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard had "issued a request to a 40-year-old man to turn himself in at a police station at a time of his choosing," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The embassy did not comment on the police request for comment.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the disclosure website WikiLeaks.
Driver who raced at 210km / h with hot drink between his legs is fined £1,000
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 210km / h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on May 27.
After police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
Howie pleaded guilty at Colchester Magistrates' Court to driving without due care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 costs and a victim surcharge of £100.
Tax for foreign property owners to tackle London's property bubble
The Treasury has provisionally scrapped the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision from Chancellor George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp duty in the 2012 Budget on homes costing more than £2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who own homes as a company rather than as individuals.
Already, stamp duty receipts for homes in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708m in the 2012 / 13 tax year, exceed the combined revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: 'After the increases in stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of legislation to clamp down on evasion, it is hard to argue that high-value properties are being taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated council tax system.'
"But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London, or discourage owners from selling," he added.
First-class properties - the top five to ten per cent of the housing market by price - in London's affluent South West belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased in price by a record 11.8 per cent in the past year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market," with the South West, North (7.4 per cent) and East (6.5 per cent) seeing an uptick, according to research by Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog's tail wagging and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say other dogs can sense these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: 'In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres react differently to stimuli that elicit positive or negative emotions.'
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, as in humans, the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different emotional roles.
To learn more about how dogs react to their counterparts "lateral wagging of tails, the researchers monitored the animals while watching films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analysed their behaviour.
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: 'We showed the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.'
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved its tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the inclination of the tail was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate intentionally with each other through these movements.
On the contrary, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience which movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: 'When you have different encounters with other dogs and the tail wagging in one direction is more associated with friendly behaviour and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behaviour, then you react on the basis of those experiences.'
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their pet's emotions.
John Bradshaw, a dog behaviour expert and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, it said: 'Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail is wagging on the left rather than on the right, rather than becoming restless - the opposite of what was found in the Italian study.'
According to him, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he said.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
However, since their behaviour can be easily recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone gig in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness

Pope Francis names first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men to ultimately help elect his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer take part in the election of the Pope - this belongs to a group of 120 "cardinals entitled to vote."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the cardinals would take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote was likely to have fallen by February.
He said that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals eligible to vote back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
Next year's Consistory is significant because it is the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to redress the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - this is all brand new.
Valero said that bishops from big cities are typically called cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he's appointing."
GM Recalls New Pickup Trucks in U.S. to Repair Seat Backrest
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a statement from the U.S. automotive safety regulator on Friday.
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit from behind, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect the occupants properly, increasing the risk of injury," the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) website read.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the leading US automaker's most important model launch since its bankruptcy-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on auto sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks in October.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Desperate cry from an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change was possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican obstructionism
Blocking policy does not excuse Obamacare website problems, drone strikes
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book at the moment.
It's a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope during the dismal second year of my medical studies.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and tells the story of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election memoir.
When I finish my patient notes in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take your breath away.
The election turned into a landslide victory, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic significance of the moment.
My classmates were crying with joy and my parents were collecting all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his approval rating was 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a rude awakening, like being torn from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, things have indeed changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and diverse things Obama has accomplished, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that partisan gridlock has overturned too many aspirations to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and closing Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But having defended the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have reached the end of my explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows foreign heads of state to be wiretapped or innocent children to be killed by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans "private lives, and why whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the findings of a report that said the White House's efforts to silence the media were the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, it can't excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, being an MP is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and fortuitous events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative; he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had been hearing about for so long.
But with Obama's approval rating dropping below 45% this week, the book's return to 2008 has become all the harder.
It awakens in me a yearning for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama suffered a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he told his staff they needed to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters get pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is embroiled in a court battle over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, made the claim as he brushed off questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, crucial to deciding whether to scrap or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He has a huge conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by a 53-vote margin after the recount.
Palmer called for an overhaul of the vote counting process to speed it up.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you walk in, enter the data into a computer, vote immediately and then get the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Voting with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new post "very seriously."
A public office is about serving the public.
"We are not seeking any reward other than that of history, which is that we can serve this community at a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation, another indication that the global regulatory investigation into alleged manipulation of the currency market is gathering pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with authorities investigating the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening investigation into the Libor interbank lending scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation into this continues and we are fully co-operating with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said RBS had passed on the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
That trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to be on leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was placed on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations that bankers colluded in currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also opened internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are combing through instant messages and emails dating back several years in search of cases of misconduct.
News of these investigations has thrown traders into turmoil in what has been one of the most profitable investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the sprawling and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders say that is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks means that "even very low ticket prices can influence the market."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens "initiative" Schweizer Wiese "has beautified the construction fence on the Bechtle property on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and widened the sidewalk, according to a news release.
The planned covering of the crumbling house in the rear part of the property had not been permitted for security reasons, because the terrain is in danger of slipping away.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had discussed the beautification project with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Prior to the BI action, a banner had been put up with the message "We are for it."
However, this did little to disturb the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the large poster was "We are against building ruins."
With this she wanted to draw attention to the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the gigantic project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site," it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the realization of the city's project, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying those answers, the BI says.
The mayor's public statements have also had an impact, it was heard.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal spa if the population voted against plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens "referendum.
Some therefore appear downright frightened, others perceive it as a "heavy-handed attempt at blackmail" against the population, the BI press release continues.
BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick rebuke for Shiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current top form of Bundesliga leaders Red Bull Salzburg, the sporting director of the "Bulls" was disappointed with the referees.
"There is a dangerous tendency at the moment for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Mane's yellow card in the 3-0 win over Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was shown an alleged act of acting - which, of course, was not one of them, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "totally overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have played "his part" in the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself claims to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was offended," the 46-year-old said.
Given the run of success, though, Rangnick sang a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for this: Really good," he said.
There's not much wrong with that.
Above all, the way the team is playing is impressive.
Let it go on.
There will be few squad changes in the winter transfer window.
There are no great reasons to change things.
"Unless a player comes in with a desire to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's healthcare law
It is a major victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By a five-to-four vote, the justices ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - which requires US citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional under the state's tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, and also held that the health care law's requirement that states either expand Medicaid eligibility or otherwise eliminate all federal Medicaid funding was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit challenging the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was emphatically opposed by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With giant mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low incidence of sunlight, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks into the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 metres, a dream of a century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!," enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on channel TV2.
Some valley dwellers lined up sun loungers, while others put on sunglasses as a safety precaution.
Until now, sun-seekers had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented a proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea had existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kroner (about 615,000 euros) project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella with wintry sunshine for several years.
Mail hardly empties any more on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes in the core city and the districts, but if you read the fine print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying does not take place on Sundays and public holidays," informs the FDP.
An inquiry by the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, emptying is only carried out in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether the Hofheim and Rosengarten will also be emptied on Sunday is not answered in the answer to the FDP's question.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday mail is an important postal service, especially for appointment mail.
"Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, this undertaking is radical and unreasonable," he said.
Thomas Bittner, group and city association chairman of the liberals, supports his group colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are secretly changed or even deleted."
The post office is miles away from being close to the citizens.
"At the very least, the mailboxes in the Neuschloß and Rosengarten districts must be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.
Also for the core city applies, particularly not mobile fellow citizens must be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday reading also within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked the city council if the city government plans to talk to the Post about the matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday reading in Hofheim.
Your party has, of course, come out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become considerably more expensive.
This morning, the municipal council of the city is discussing a proposal from Transport Minister Stefan Majer (Greens).
Parking charges are to be increased by 50 per cent.
The aim is not to raise prices, but to shorten the time interval between parking meters and ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
The city council still has to decide in December.
The retail committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce considers this "not a good idea."
The possibility of parking directly in front of the shop is "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller specialist dealers."
The German Transport Club is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue."
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions catch the hosts by surprise
Men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller School Gym in Reutlingen with a narrow squad.
The senior players were on the other side of the net with an experienced squad.
Soon it became apparent, however, that they, also due to their age, could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the people of Freudenstadt.
The patrons had a hard time with the hard and placed serves.
Repeatedly, they missed passes and tackles neatly delivered by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the middle of the net and were not on hand to block.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the people of Freudenstadt in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and game-determining performance, the third set was won somewhat laxly and listlessly to a 3: 0 final score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2nd with TV Baiersbronn, who was able to prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and gift of points, especially in receiving the ball; precision in passing was also scarce at times and in some critical scenes the over-eagerness hindered the view of possible scoring opportunities.
In this match, which was very well balanced in terms of performance, the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto was right throughout.
Care Day at the Little Englander's Cottage
For what is now the fifth day of care in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project Oberer Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small Englandhütte in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, the view into the valley was to be cut off in the area of the hut on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the Schluchtensteig, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Care Day was a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the touristic aspect also the ecological consideration can be found.
Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council explained this ecological aspect after the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who took over the patronage and wished the action a successful outcome.
According to Tribukait, the touristic goal of far-sightedness coincides with the goal of preserving the old allmendweidfeld, which has since become overgrown, with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting it to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free compounds for conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss out on a spear for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure does not only fit seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous supplement of what has been achieved with the Life Project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, and the forestry tractor would be on call if necessary.
A group of volunteers should take care of the clearance of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a drystone bar.
The goal was an unobstructed view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own public utilities can be described as an attractive city, no other mayoral candidate has yet registered.
The 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been confirmed as the only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer standing for mayor due to his age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against handset makers on Thursday, including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents relate to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which goes to the heart of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture handsets that run Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million bid for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After being outbid by Rockstar for Nortel's patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in the auction, Google infringed the patents and continues to do so," the complaint states.
Rockstar is seeking high damages from Google for claiming that Google's patent infringement was intentional, according to the allegation.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to spell the end of Egypt's political disputes.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court, which sits on the Nile and is modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability," said Morsi, 60, a U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been sharply targeted by the government since it was founded 84 years ago as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike Mubarak-era presidential pomp, traffic was halted only briefly so that the convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
Mocked as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare wheel," his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists, but for all who sought to achieve the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Morsi later drove to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by an army band playing the national anthem, which he listened to in a husky voice.
The military leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's largest auditorium with chants of "The army and the people are one hand."
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers taken by the military council from the ousted leader.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not, as usual, before parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discotheque ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it is "Pump this party," tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker fell from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker fell off a ladder in Eggelsberg while replacing a defective outer sensor and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of a guest house.
When he climbed the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken by the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg.
Rapist in South Africa jailed for life twice
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life terms on Friday.
This was reported by broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of the serious injuries.
John Cana was found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The act had sparked outrage across the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial estate in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
Doctors fought for 14 hours to save the victim, but to no avail.
The sight of the youths was so horrific that the carers and nurses needed psychological help.
Kana had admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially assumed that there were several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because there was insufficient evidence against them.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Cana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape has become an almost daily occurrence in South Africa, with around 64,000 complaints of sexual violence made each year.
This is almost ten times as many as in Germany, which, with 82 million people, has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
But police and women's groups in South Africa estimate the number of sexual assaults to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Ham
Jumbo in search of "the best ham in the world": The Pro7 star visited Bonndorf for the TV show "Galileo."
Right from the start, the spokesman makes it clear that the most important thing for ham is the pork legs, and turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can the ham you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and a coat does he enter the factory.
Jumbo, too, must first disinfect his hands before he is allowed to grab the microphone.
Jumbo sighted for refreshment at fast food in Waldshut
"I work in huge quantities here," marvel the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat percentage, colour: Uli explains what matters when it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
Television at its best?
Details such as the pH value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
"I'm curious to see what happens," he says cynically.
Here the standard of private television is presented in its purest form.
But it's still worth watching.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the clubs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally to be found boneless on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the mixture of spices and salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind jumbo optically of a "submarine."
The trick: Sprigs of fir provide the special taste of Black Forest ham in the smoke.
Finally, 20 days in the smoke turn the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears into the jumbo," he announces the test consumption.
"It's really delicious," is the TV star's conclusion.
Everyone involved will be able to live with that.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be bucking the trend.
The company has raised its full-year profit outlook and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted annual pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If current targets are met, this will mean growth of 12 to 17 per cent compared to record profits of $290.4 million in 2011-12.
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre made an eight per cent profit in the first half and had a strong start to the second half, particularly in its Australian and UK retail businesses.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year and some of them are on track for record annual earnings before interest and tax," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest performers.
In Australia, the leisure sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK fared similarly well, while business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the year as a whole is expected for the third year in a row.
Shares in Flight Centre rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, pupils will be required to cover at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils will be required to sit a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Department for Education will publish the new curriculum for English and maths - the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will announce a shake-up of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was a "broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence," stressing that GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths - 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year - than most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and Singapore students receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to include more time for math in the curriculum, coalition sources say that comprehensive math testing - combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in league tables - will likely encourage schools to add more hours.
The curriculum places more emphasis on "real-life problems," including financial math.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented at the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau in the Bürgerhaus this weekend.
The assessments were made on Thursday
Once again the local association W514 organizes this great exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs existing in the district of Soest show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate at the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3: 30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle with substantial prizes in kind and to a tasty cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson parted her iconic blonde locks and appeared with a new bub head for the first time.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talks Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the Neues Museum of the castle, the topic will be "To Hell with Hell - Theological reflections on today's handling of the last things."
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about this in past centuries, relying on those images of heaven and hell "which still shape our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for perfection is characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out of Christians by criticism of religion," says the speaker.
She had "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the nuisance of death."
Linked to this is the question of the yearning "that dreams of everything being good in the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Johanna Rahner has held a chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel since 2010.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg confirm their profession of faith at confirmation
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
The divine service was accompanied in the morning by the Laudato-Si group, and in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
Receiving the sacrament of Confirmation, the young people said yes to their Baptism and implored the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the guidance of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the confirmands had prepared for the great feast day.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced together the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In splendid weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee informs.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres in altitude, there were also numerous cyclo-cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placings at the German Championships.
These two managed to get away from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader managed to save a small time advantage until the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again able to place in second place.
In the women's race, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
Second and third place went to Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance capacity, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four riders managed to break away from the regional leaders.
Among them was Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Together with a team-mate, Pangerl has already been world champion in the twelve-hour race twice.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Among them is Roland Ballerstedt, who has already won two German championship titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude difference, there was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it finale at the finish in front of the Drei-Seen-Halle.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only one second behind the experienced Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall classification.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann finished third overall.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest woman in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organised running of the event.
Travelling through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to be named CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father lost consciousness again and again and travelled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then inflammation developed, which spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they needed.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be first, but you're not first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
By contrast, in the United States, the ratio is one doctor for every 413 people.
But even if they had a doctor, most Cameroonians would not be able to afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and drive with their medical equipment strapped to their roofs over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything does not always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: a banquet, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration, and Bwelle - with his broad smile and boundless energy - is happy to be part of the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will begin examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," Bwelle said.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates - a document required for school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, a town hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the group's generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It is an exhausting schedule, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has carried out 700 free surgeries in the past year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he received now allows him to work again.
"This is changing the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, Bwelle says, he finances 60% of his charitable work, with the rest coming from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgeries where we help to swab blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He's unquestionably a hero," O'Malley said.
He dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is a source of great joy to him.
"I'm so happy to be doing this job," Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea," is tailor-made for Janson.
Janson is himself an old hand in his profession, acting.
Nobody can deceive the old man Santiago while fishing.
So the two complement each other just great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits in the chair, bent over by life, it is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is thoroughly a character role, which Janson handles excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish with his knowledge and his strength of will.
Janson is for the most part a solo performer on stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are never dull.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the spectators forget that the sea is only made up of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he illuminates the active scene in each case: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her splendid voice the attitude towards life in Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm to it and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewer from Roman times has been preserved at a length of around 120 metres below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you cannot miss the cathedral.
The two towers rise around 157 metres into the sky, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree steeples, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too big remained of the remains of the old city walls.
Most of the users of the car park therefore today also rush past the Roman remains and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site in the parking deck D2, which is separated by metal bars.
You can see ruins about five meters high made of palm-sized stones.
"They are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze says.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look into a dark shaft 15 meters deep on the upper level of the park.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
Next stop of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
We are witnessing the official residence of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetorian guard of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, "which in plain English means" city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinensi, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the cult of the emperor. ""
And the Praetorium is the former palace of governors, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the antechamber of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewer, which has been preserved here along a length of around 120 metres.
"You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After collecting the key from the cash register, he leads the group to a walkable shaft 16 metres deep.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground in order to get the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual ablutions.
To this day, the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, shows different water levels due to changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction is expected to begin shortly.
However, it will take several years before it is completed.
Leg almost chopped off: New edition of rocker trial
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is rolled out again after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun at the Regional Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants remained silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and to have belonged to the Bandidos at that time.
The public prosecutor's office accuses them, together with unknown accomplices, of stabbing and hitting three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, and one man nearly lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to rival group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a senior member from Berlin.
It appeared to have been preceded by a multi-car chase.
According to the indictment, it was about turf battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in an initial trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators were wearing masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court of Justice annulled the verdict after an appeal by the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the regional court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open prison for another offence.
At the beginning, the focus was on the reconstruction of the events on the night of the crime.
The commissioner investigating at the time was called as a witness.
At the center were cell phone conversations of the defendants and other people that the police had bugged.
Difficult is that rockers almost always abide by an iron law in court - and don't testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt (Oder) said when asked that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of hearings are scheduled for the trial.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point we go home.
The only difference is that hunger is noticeable in the bellies of the people in the passenger and back seats.
Of course, one or two cocktails or sparkling wines may be to blame!
What could be more obvious than chilling out and heading to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a snack?
I admit I like to be there when it comes to getting fast food late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a Coke, a burger - and then go home and go to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become noticeable.
Because what do you have to miss, that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Particularly at weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and in car parks.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home to the nearest bin?
It's not just that the paper stuff spoils the landscape.
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as guardrails and thus caused accidents.
But the aforementioned "throwaway society" does not think about such a thing, presumably it does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are on the road more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after a night of partying: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
A few bags would more or less make no difference - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the leftovers of other people's food.
I can already see the day coming when cities and municipalities will become too stupid to clear away - and fast food chains will have to pay a deposit for their bags.
Obama's Retreat on Health Care Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
In recent days, after hundreds of thousands of people received a termination letter from their insurer, Republicans have accused the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama put his original promise into perspective.
"The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep it," he said during a speech in Boston.
Responding to numerous media reports about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans who have received such notices to look for new insurance on the open market.
This would enable most citizens to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price, or more cheaply than predicted.
"They come up with a better deal," he said.
The administration said it was unsurprising that the five percent of the population who bought insurance would have to look for a different rate because their policies did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say directly to these Americans: They deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is in charge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been "abysmal" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
That statement by an enraged Sebelius to an aide sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was recorded after a dispute with Representative Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius about why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act didn't voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan on HealthCare.gov that she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem government fails to confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria, a day earlier.
The target was "rockets and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanon's Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arabic channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled on Wednesday night and blamed the Israelis.
Israel's Channel 2 television showed satellite images of the Latakia base showing Russian S-125 Neva anti-aircraft missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 said have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters news agency quoted an Israeli government official, also anonymous, as saying that he believed Israel had carried out the attack but was not sure.
An Israeli defence ministry spokesman said: "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai pointed out in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, sometimes successfully, to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line," followed by a military response.
John Kerry says US espionage has' gone too far inappropriately'
John Kerry, in an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the US's defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that espionage had in some cases gone "unreasonably far."
The Foreign Secretary also admitted that he shared responsibility with Barack Obama for switching to "autopilot" when whistleblower Edward Snowden's explosive revelations about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The leaked information has sent the US government into a diplomatic storm of outrage from its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: 'There is no question that the president and I, and others in the administration, learned of some of the things that were going on virtually on autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was there, going back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, September 11.'
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases it has gone too far.'
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one feels that there is abuse taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance had saved many lives.
He added: 'We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.'
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept it and stop it before it happens?
We have, in fact, prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations because of frustration with National Security Agency surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board in our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who is a first-term Democrat in the Senate and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the intelligence chief said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had monitored the cellphones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common practice on both sides.
Amid all the turmoil, Murphy said his office was preparing for a congressional trip later this year and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other MPs taking part are due to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments needed to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans' rights, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to confront resentment over America's strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as its surveillance activities.
A persistent ankle injury threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in FC Augsburg's Bundesliga away game against FSV Mainz 05.

'We will decide on his availability in the short term, 'coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old is hoping to have his best goalscorer with six goals.
Because Mainz already have to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals against jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the sentence and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the early hours of Sunday 10 June while two other men were holding her.
Later, however, CCTV footage showed she had arrived safely at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket questioned Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
She was in police custody at the scene until the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rugby league player, who has written to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family were 'extremely concerned' for his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are obviously very concerned, but we hope she is back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the sentence and is free on 50,000 baht bail.
Australian reports said she is currently on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may seek to improve its tarnished tourist image following the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, leading to an acquittal.
