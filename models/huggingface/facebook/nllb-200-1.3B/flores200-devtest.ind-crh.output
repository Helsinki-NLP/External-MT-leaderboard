not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had fur, a theory that has been widely circulated, but it can also provide details that fossils would not normally provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the animal's fur is chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed trunks, called rachis, but had other characteristics spines and barbels researchers concluded that rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers argue that, although this is a baby dinosaur's tail, the samples show adult bird feathers, not chicken feathers.

Gold can be shaped into many different shapes.
Gold could be pulled into thin wires, so that it could be twisted and woven, forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin, and adhered to other metals. It can also be made so thin that it is sometimes used as a decoration for hand paintings in books called "light illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is a proton whose electrons are stripped (because the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).

The medium-sized cat below preys on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each cat does to keep them from competing with other cats.
The lion is the most social cat, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their offspring.
Females are usually tightly knit together, as a big family of sisters and daughters.
Prides in being like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.

The tiger is still in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, all four of which are able to roar.
The tiger's roar is not the roar of a lion with a full voice, but rather a phrase spoken in a roar, a shout.
Ocelot prefers small animals. Ocelot catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that are hunted by ocelots are much smaller in size.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and seek prey by sniffing, sniffing the tracks of prey on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with their night vision, and they also move very quietly. They hunt by folding around and trapping their prey.
When a small group of organisms (small populations) are separated from their original main population (such as if they move to mountains or rivers, or if they move to new islands so they cannot easily return), they will often encounter environments different from those they previously occupied.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be able to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they seem to be shrinking like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
we call it the process of speciation, which means the formation of new species. species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which humans breathe, and they breathe carbon dioxide which humans exhale (which means, breathe).

Mosasaurus was the top predator of his time so he was afraid of nothing but fellow mosasaurs.
The long jaw is filled with over 70 teeth as sharp as a whisk, plus extra rows of teeth at the top of the mouth, meaning that nothing can escape when it passes through the mouth.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a branching tongue, that he ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe he's been a cannibal all along.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, including giant dinosaurs like the T. rex who cannot compete with it.

If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
e, despite the writing on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
" The back of the Declaration of Independence reads " The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Though no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days large papyrus documents (size 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) were rolled up for preservation.
So, the notation is most likely just inserted as a label.

For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
still being produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format groups) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds that is most often violated and underestimated is the simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective place for such a main subject is the meeting of the lines that separate the image into vertically and horizontally three (see examples).

He arrived in the US with 4 cents on his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The most popular of these was the Three Kingdoms epic, which spanned the 60-year interval between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles were fought between the nobles for the throne.
Tri Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute to republican government, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
nnn,nn the revolution,nn jobs were openedto all male applicants,n openingthe opportunityto successto those who were most ambitious.
The same goes for the military because instead of ranking soldiers based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class citizens from other countries to start their own revolution.
"Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) was fascinated by the things beyond this worldly life.
he confined himself, which survived through time, giving a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
t,t is not easy to findt even when one knows it existst once inside the cave,t is a condition of total isolation.
n't there anything to see but the clear skies above and the mountains around.n't there much to see or hear from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing today.

"The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a magnificent Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The up arcs look like the letter V and the down arcs look like staples or squares that have no underside".
Up means you start at the end and push the bow, and down means you start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward friction usually produces a softer sound, whereas downward friction is stronger and more firm.
Please feel free to write your own mark, but there is a musical reason for the printed bow mark, so usually the mark must be obeyed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by the mass of market women.
In the carriage, they journeyed back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and threatened the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open wide the windows of their carriages.
At one point, one of the mob members waved the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The US imperialist war expenditure in conquering the Philippines paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance most of the spending and interest on bonds floating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are of course the basic profits of US imperialism.

The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The height of the Middle Ages was from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 by convention.

"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" on society, not merely a socially conditioned one".
For example, someone might say that the car should lead to the development of the highway.
nce, the national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also led to high rates of road accidents, which led to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare world to repair damaged bodies.
Romantism has a considerable element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with it emerged, and these, in keeping with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.

Its fame as a centre of luxury dates from 400 to about 1100.

It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.

However, because of the slow pace of communication, the western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Throughout the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style.One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades, people began to wear buttons to tighten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system of using stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with rotational planting and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in self-sustaining agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that distinguish one subculture from another may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture usually mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashion, character, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow up.
"Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child is due to the parent's refusal to treat a child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children display behaviour (in physical limits) almost entirely like certain animals that care for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.

Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support tool for individuals who are experiencing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.

Virtual Scaffolding is internalised in the software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may be too challenging for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for various reasons, such as forcing, harassment, and even blackmail.
Children should not be raised in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing, and educating, but it is.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Schools should provide all the necessities that were not in the home where they were taken before.
Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to an additional dimension in terms of use and approach to gratification.
"For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Personal engagement""continuous relationship" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recorders led to the important discovery of the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements, which occur in milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his paper entitled The President's Speech, shows how someone who is speech-impaired because of brain damage is still able to accurately judge honesty.
He even proposed that the ability to interpret such human behavior might be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
20th century research shows that there are two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
mutation adds new genetic variation, whereas selection removes it from the group of expression variation.
Segregation and recombination stir up back and forth variation between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Additionally, failure to do so has serious consequences, such as growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources are proteins found in leaves and nuts, but they're hard to digest for primates like us, unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (anth, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors tackled the protein problem in a way that is almost identical to the way chimpanzees do in the savannah today".
Sleep disorder is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period, and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively silent alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.

Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates with the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. the only thing that stops us is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism uses the foundation of Buddhism, but later expands it with a focus on Mahayana love and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.

With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.

Germany was a common enemy in WWII, resulting in cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war and the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures resulting in the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and it would be fought in the flesh, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
The plan fell apart overnight, however, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian Guards after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.

The Navy's job is traditionally to ensure that your country is able to maintain its capability in terms of movement of people and goods, and at the same time, to block your enemy's capability in terms of movement of people and goods.
one of the most important and recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in WWII. the Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mostly used U-boats, tried to prevent this traffic jam.

The ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Goats tend to be used by children or adults, similar to those more familiar to shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.

This became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the trains to break down faster.
In 1767, the first railway made entirely of iron was born.
The first known form of transport was walking. With the appearance of Homo erectus, two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithcus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

After being adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was brought a few blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
"Overnight about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides"."
The document was first read out publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap tablets that have survived are the oldest known copies of the document.

Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of internal toxicity may be seen in the presence of open storage of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label of first aid instructions that are specific to a particular toxin.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term stems from a past familiarity with the bad fleas, which are extremely adaptable insects that parasitize humans.
Killer Flea Bed bugs are nidicolous animals, adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
n the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to get MS as males.
couple may decide that it is for their own good, or the good of their child, to raise the child.
The couple may choose to make plans for the adoption of their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents revoke their custody so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It's not alone, it's experimental, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalist and philosopher focused on the classical text and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge waned, the West found itself drawn to the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many who observe rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Rhythm, which is not just a response to periodic external signals, has been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
Biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue the cycle period running freely even when no external signals are present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major proposals to establish that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They've done two experiments, namely, tagging DNA inside phages with radioactive phosphorus and tagging phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germ lineage cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to the offspring, whereas other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.

Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning about ecosystems.
Visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Everyday morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplace and meet other people whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on personal cars.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there such complaints about transport systems, why do their services always fail? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on right now?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult to do because driver behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonably consistent and more or less mathematically represented range.
To better represent traffic flows, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to travel into space, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and search for food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings parallel to their bodies.
This gives them a wider choice of small-sized places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and dragonflies.

The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the world's widest river, measuring some 6 miles [9.6 km] in width.
20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers to the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the main river, measuring 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) in length, and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.


Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.



Aristoteles, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new matter to form what we see.
Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.

You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Toda la materia en el universo esta hecha de partículas pequeñas llamadas atomos.
The size of the atom is so small that the dot at the end of this sentence can contain several trillion atoms.

Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of pencils have been degraded.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to use random.
one can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to form an atomic nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill, breaking up the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that atoms tend to break with little or no contact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible that there are more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
satisfaction theory is about finding out what moves people or what attracts them.
These various theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow up.
Theory of behavior analyzes the characteristics of people that make them want something, and the factors in the environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are two of the most famous charge theories.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to stay "one of the guys" (or women)".

On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to division between the leader and the team.
Virtual teams have the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their physical live groups.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to various time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a real "stealth team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams".

Why do organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of the practice of the learning organization concept is innovation.
When all the available resources are used effectively across all the functional departments of an organization, creativity, and intelligence can flourish.
As a result, the processes of an organization working together to solve problems can give rise to innovative new processes to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and learning within the organisation.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, these data narrow down the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavioural changes and some mental functions.
The advent of new technology has allowed us to look at and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build a simulation model that helps us understand the processes in our minds.
Though AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate jobs that require intelligent behavior.
examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.

AI systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into some home computer applications and video game software.

Technology offers solutions with virtual tours where students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
