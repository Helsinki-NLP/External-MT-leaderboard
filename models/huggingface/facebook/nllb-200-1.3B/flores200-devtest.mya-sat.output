Lions are the most common cat species, living in large groups called lion herds.
The lion herds are made up of one to three adult male lions, over 30 females and cubs.

The wolf or dog pack behaves very similarly to the lion. These animals behave remarkably similarly to the lion and (other than other felines) also attack their prey to death.
The tiger is a powerful, agile animal that can climb, swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is a member of the genus Panthera, which includes the lion, tiger, and tiger-lion.
The tiger's voice is not the same as the lion's voice, but it is more like a sentence with a lot of angry words.
Wild cats are predators of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if they can. Wild cats hunt almost all animals that are smaller than themselves.
The Oslo Wildcat is a wildcat that tracks rats by sniffing where they have been on the ground for food.
Night vision is a good light in the dark and can sneak around. Wild cats often scare their prey around and jump on it.
When a subgroup (small group) breaks away from the parent group (such as migrating to a mountain range or river, or not being able to easily re-migrate when migrating to a new island), they are found in a different new environment than they have been before.
