The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight voter fraud.
But the Brennan Center calls such fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Republican attorneys, for example, have only documented 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the US, the states are responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, most US governments since 2009 have enacted new laws that make it more difficult to vote or register to vote.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills restricting voting rights were introduced in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register to vote on election day and disqualify citizens with criminal records from voting.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian Act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities were quick to extend this procedure to other states.
In the last two years, they've sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a government-issued photo ID.
Also, about five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
In addition, obtaining the required ID often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African Americans, 15% of those with incomes of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their support of Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID cards issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It's worth noting that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states supported laws that remove voter registration on Election Day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigns to register voters helped to register some 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, African Americans made up 33% of the early voters, even though African American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted early.
On the other hand, whites, who made up 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the early voters.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been very vocal in opposing the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors have vetoed several bills.
The Attorney General of the United States even intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They've managed to contain some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics mainly speak of the bias of the laws passed and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the outcome of the elections in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: to be screened or not to be screened?
The PSA test often returned false negative or even false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this added to the hesitancy of men who were already reluctant to go for examinations.
To be examined or not to be examined?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
Studies in the USA have shown high levels of contamination among the individual groups tested, making it difficult to interpret these results and to make any meaningful recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed that those who did not get screened had a 30 to 40 percent increased risk of metastasis after a 12-year interval.
So I recommend screening from age 50 or from age 40 if your immediate family member has had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and there are those that are non-invasive.
So it's important to explain to the patient the danger level of their cancer, to offer them alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer that doesn't have a life-threatening effect in the long term, but to focus on active surveillance in these cases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and not life-threatening.
Rather, we recommend that they be monitored and offered treatment if the disease progresses.
more frequently and with greater precision We are continually establishing criteria to help decide which species to treat and which not.
I still recommend that you get tested.
But it is important to consult a doctor to determine whether you should have the test.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has developed a tool that allows for and against evaluation in relation to the PSA test.
The following is a list of the most commonly used tests for prostate cancer:
The prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and got enough exercise, up to 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, the rate would go up to at least 50 percent", notes André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
A certain percentage also remains totally unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for the Canadian Cancer Research Society, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They're also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely damaging to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
The encouraging fact: 10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
The weight
Obesity and obesity are another risk factor for the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life is protective against colorectal cancer", adds the report.
The nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
If consumed in excess, it may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid the same.
Preserving meat by drying, salting or curing may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", adds the report.
Other fats and oils
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, studies have not yet reached a definite conclusion.
Studies on vitamin E are conflicting according to the SCC.
Although one study suggests a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study suggests an increase.
Nor is the effect of vitamin D on cancer clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu further stresses the importance of discussing your concerns and family precedents with your doctor.
"Going through a test does not mean you will get cancer".
The Higgs Boson explored
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There's a theory that this boson is part of the mechanism that's responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And then there's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model -- our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But physicists are still not 100% sure that this is the Higgs boson.
He doesn't doubt that we have a brand-new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
New data released this week at the big physics convention in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but we don't yet have all the data to be absolutely certain.
But let's assume it's the Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems small, and let's see what's really going on.
There is an absolutely undeniable law in this world that two things cannot exist at the same time in the same place.
There is no way around this rule - and don't try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it has a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two particles can occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" roughly accounts for some of their properties.
He further divides particle physics into two categories.
On one side, we find the orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow the Pauli principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, nasty anarchists who don't care about anything at all -- certainly not this principle, which means they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups by the (incidentally, absolutely amazing) facility that is The Particle Adventure, at Berkeley Labs: mesons, which we'll leave unnoticed here, and "force particles", which are the great forces of nature that are propagating and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
It must be said, though, that these bosons are not as exotic as some might think.
If you are reading this article, it is because of a boson of unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When a charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - one of the bosons, the "force carriers".
A more stable field
It's the same with the Higgs boson, except that you have to "interrupt" another field, the Higgs field, for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it requires very high energy values to be excited, much like the frozen surface of a pond that only a very large boulder would erode.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with the input beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to be able to develop such energy.
The electromagnetic field analogy is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and matter.
Not all particles or materials react with an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to a refrigerator by itself.
And also, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain amount of mass, while others (like the photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all this research is for, what does it "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, this is a validation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between observations and predictions of SM.
And many physicists literally wish they could find them, because the slightest difference could open up space for "new physics" and fill in some of the gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model is still very flawed, it does not provide any explanation of gravity (ouch!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the cosmic matter (ouch!).
However, CERN has not yet detected such discrepancies.
The response
The responses to these surveys in the daily lives of Mr and Mrs Novak are very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be none.
Look: back in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would bring.
They were supposed to be for scientific purposes, but that's all.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I've already said - the laser was originally considered a kind of "laboratory toy".
Just think about it.
And, in addition, the application may also arise from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although not originally planned by Boyle, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the LHC activities have to change our lives, but it does mean that you never really know...
Palliative care is the best way to go out of life.
Through its Commission for a Dignified Dying, Quebec has recently become involved in the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly, and a bill is being prepared.
Much work remains to be done in this vital area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look into the matter in more detail.
Not many weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him up gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years to live, and it's seven", he says without emotion in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this", he adds.
The disease has done its work: extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet or even to eat alone.
He looks resignedly at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage for a common death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea that is humiliating me", she confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"You learn throughout life that men pee standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Institute.
Going back to the baby phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the individual" to accept the return, says the psychologist.
Many palliative care practitioners feel that the crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter Victor-Gadbois hospice all have cancer.
Their prognosis is three months to life at most.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is dying "by suffocation while fully conscious".
But illness allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life", she says, then encourages us to put her on a respirator.
Yet, in the days ahead, he is still looking forward to his son's final visit from Italy.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers provide nutritional body care.
This is what palliative care looks like when you can't do anything else.
To make death more comfortable for you.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 residents.
That's very little when you consider that we're all going to die someday.
Here, life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's physicians.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person is dying, they can be given a shot of brandy or pepsi, for example, to their liking.
Diabetics no longer need to watch their blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
They were bringing beer to Mr. X last night, who died later that night.
This morning, his son is finishing his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, director of the nursing service.
At Victor-Gadbois, the days are one after the other, but they don't resemble each other.
Beside a 33-year-old man, who is enjoying his last reunion with his family, propped up on cushions, as they toast to his memory, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after having tried all the possibilities to survive.
"For six months now, there are always three to five beds reserved for people with cancer up to the age of 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care that is designed to alleviate suffering once a patient reaches the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor Gado-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec that is causing many palliative care doctors to be concerned about the passage of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
As of October, a manifesto signed by leading figures in the field of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating, expressing their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not strong enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be agreed to.
She says that recently she experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the ER in excruciating pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to help her.
He is concerned that patients may not ask to be killed because of a lack of proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists continue to care for their patients until the last minute, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already slim to none when she abandoned the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was ending my treatment, she said that she regretted stopping fighting, telling us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no such thing as all-purpose care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90 percent of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not granting their wishes when the palliative care team relieves their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is not all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Grand Montréal, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives to lull the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by injection or by continuous sedation.
We cannot pretend to ignore this part of the suffering.
A patient who's not being relieved of pain will have increasing access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want you to take the pain away".
This report was made possible by a grant to journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The major real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works contractors, political party lobbyists, and experts on the Italian Mafia keep on telling what they know about the marvelous "system" that mixes the construction industry, government officials, politicians, labor unions, and the Mafia.
This "scale" came at a great cost to Quebec taxpayers, particularly between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting to see how the system has unraveled since we took the big step", quips Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal.
He was responsible for the 2011 scandal that resulted from a thorough investigation into the misappropriation of funds in connection with the construction of roads in Quebec, which was approved by then-Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest after long delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010", he says, "the Department of Transportation alone has saved a billion dollars in contracts" by keeping some people in check by their instincts to get a share of them!
The Charbonneau Commission, which "has led to the resignation of two mayors", adds with the hope that it will be able to "expose the fraud of some people".
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved in the fight with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
And then there are the Marteau police officers who, since 2009, have ensured that the Montreal money-laundering cartel has significantly reduced the inflow of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and have charged a number of city officials with fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban community.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been brought against Montreal-based transport engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the 'system' for obtaining public contracts.
He himself, during those years, donated 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal to a middleman connected to the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was a candidate.
Zambito has been generous to all parties since 2000, donating more than C$88,000 (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, but mainly to the Liberals who were then in power.
He also confessed to having organized illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Transaction orders with prices above the bidding limit
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very subtle.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: "Over a period of ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to field trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and a total of $736,000 in cash in exchange for contracts with money-changers, for which he was overcharging".
Other public transport officials admitted that they had been paid for overpaying invoices by 30% to 40% by means of false invoices.
Mayor Martin Dumont's party organizer then accused Tremblay of blinking without remorse over the concurrent budget that was bringing dirty money into his coffers.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a widespread crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been opposing since 2010 the sale of a public land purchased for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million to developers right in the middle of a booming real estate market.
70% of campaign money
Of the investigation that will eventually be launched, he says that he is "pulling the strings to understand the workings of the ant-spray system to stop the gangrene and find the culprits".
She describes the process as "painful but positive".
We're in the process of cleaning up the damage, but it's imperative that we establish a dedicated investigative unit in Montreal and provide oversight so that these dubious practices can't be allowed to return.
Like when he cleans up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially worried about the role of "ambassadors informed of this trick" if they do not fall into these traps!
He estimates that 70% of the funding for Quebec's election campaigns comes from dirty money, and adds ironically, "I've heard that's a thinly veiled version of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but he says that won't solve the situation: "Unless election spending is strictly limited, dirty money from politics won't go away".
He proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: 'We can no longer go down; if we focus boldly on the substance of things, we can build again on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with the law.'
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that all who mock him take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You've taken a whole new league this season with PSG.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all the individuals going into themselves, or by a whole new dimension of the PSG.
We've got some big players coming in.
I get closer to them every day.
The tech team helped me a lot too.
Every day, these realities allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier when you're at the game.
Everything is happening so fast in this picture.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the INF Clairefontaine training camp to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always been a graduate.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti has created...
This year's recruits are used to playing at a very high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
And it turns out that a player like me has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give it a go.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of credit for my stature.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right moment?
Of course I did.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
Today, he is the best coach in the Premier League and one of the best in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with the best teams.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
I had a reassuring talk with him in January.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
Lyon has taken the lead in the league.
But we're still in the loop.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we've easily advanced to the last eight.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for the top European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group against Porto first so we can play the eighth-place rematch at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget for it...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
Today, it's not that.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this intention a reality.
And would a big failure be not winning the Premier League like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We were a little short last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the numbers to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you're the clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more spectacular season.
I think this year's gonna be great.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are vying for the title, I think we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what we've invested and the players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's true that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and still find something to blame us in the newspapers, it's not very pleasant.
Makes you wonder what more people could ask of you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a play style.
It takes time to build a team.
We showed in the Champions League that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who have not made it to the last eight for the second season in a row, and they've also invested a lot of money!
Given the amount of money you've invested, you'd be expected to have a 15-point lead over the rest of the field!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, who had a poor season last year, have moved into the next phase with the new PSG.
It just goes to show how awesome the A-League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
It seems PSG are relying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances in everything.
It's good to say there is a "Zlatan addiction".
It means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here, to prove he's a major league star.
Everywhere he went, he proved he was a great player, a world star.
On our team, we respect the man and the player.
He respects the people around him, too.
What he has achieved is truly extraordinary.
This led others to raise their own game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How was your experience with the French team at Euro 2012?
It's like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of my injury, I couldn't play the way I wanted to.
But I went through it and I came out stronger.
I'm playing some good games for the national team today.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to be exemplary in our actions.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps' first months in charge of the national team?
The results speak for themselves.
We're in a good place in the World Cup qualifiers.
The coach is very selective, he's very close to the players, and he can get them excited about winning.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I just don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.
Is the one-on-one draw in Spain on October 16th a solid opening match?
This match has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen a fight like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can buy and sell without a bank
All negatives of current central bank-based financial transactions, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
And as is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual money (but convertible to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered on the network's 15,000 computers.
There are about a thousand websites that already accept bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin first reached a high of $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, and is now hovering around $10 (see chart at bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange of real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is taking a look at this in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin is described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar and the euro", and "the embodiment of fiat money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is used as "credits" to advance in a video game, which one can earn by playing or which one can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But every month, the central body checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are depositors of the current account book, controllers, issuers of money, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses via e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
The content of the file also makes it possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in a public ledger of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to record this new transaction in this ledger.
It's done by solving a mathematical problem given to the computers, whose solver, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the right to write this extra line.
This is the file-cutting phase; that is, the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
The computers "take over" this new transaction and add the number to it, only to "slice" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific impression (a value of zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily check its correctness.
The transaction is then shown to be indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any editing would change the imprint.
If a user were to pay with the same money twice in a very short time (within ten minutes) for fraud purposes, the network would confirm only one of the two transactions - the other would be omitted, because each one has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited to 21 million, but it can be divided by a hundred million, so there's room for margin...
The difficulty of the task also increases with the level of computation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
A website that provides services for Bitcoin has been hacked and the stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The problem is not the protocol itself", assures Pierre Noizat, founder of Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the same problem applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia are rejecting donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current account book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, the 'giant discounts' were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a gold-to-bitcoin exchange.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a textbook on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payments, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which makes it cheaper.
In addition, the user manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up at retailers, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
All it takes is to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognised" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and move towards more horizontal systems.
"It's going to take a while for Bitcoin to take off, but 2013 could be the year that matters", he predicts.
In addition, the ECB's report envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are currently considered to be increased if this type of money is to succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's the next step?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people who suffered the most were the people in the Afghan countryside, who were punished because we thought they were terrorists.
We lost 88 soldiers, and all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often they are villagers who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks joined them.
Now they're tolerated and often helped by local insurgents, but if Western powers withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of the Nijabra, which I had observed from the top of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, was orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul unharmed, escorted by helicopters.
By the end of 2014, the Taliban will be less active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable march from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the ground was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different rebel groups.
Their taking control of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid a price for the oppression of these villagers, who were completely controlled by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation did not improve until our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban are all working together to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, they took over state land, which they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and they used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They have discredited themselves; most of them have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people want a government that isn't run by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have benefited from American generosity will do: the outflow of capital is considerable.
The young are tired of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they were introduced to the modern world and its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has 5 million residents, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full, boys and girls.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they do not want to return to the tyranny of the old parties or the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; they watch TV and Turkish TV series that show the modern world everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand at its head be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should have enjoyed a certain degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the eve of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, just fruits and vegetables.
Private initiative is preferred.
In a country ravaged by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Word has spread that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that the West was there to take it over.
Without the energy to process the iron ore or copper on site and the means to transport the raw materials over the mountains, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mine of Mes Aynak and allowed international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist site in order to retain their role as the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of their import and export depends, will also need to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of the usual forms of assistance: lyceums for girls and boys, departments of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "receive heart and soul" initiative, which attempted the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, was operated by the Ministry of Defence's "civil-military actions" service (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a series of successes in the field of common interest and agricultural recovery measures in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a small number of French NGOs.
These works, involving many local workers, helped quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of arable land.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often above 2000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in Kapisa Province.
To free themselves from the insurrection of foreign-led groups, these farmers say they wish to obtain a small amount of civil aid for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and would affect them directly.
The Tough Work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi has started another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history over the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, he has decided to play vabanco.
On Wednesday, he announced that regardless of the opinion of everyone else, the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been amended many times, undermining the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal wrangles.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's polarization.
From the opposition's perspective, the president continues to be in his "autocratic delusion", continues to "break his word" and "trample the law".
But his supporters say it is a means to end the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to abandon its plan to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
For the president, it's also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the country is in the midst of protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will vote for him.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people in front of an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I will keep my unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And it was in this particular atmosphere that yesterday 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals were absent at the polls.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitution was promulgated, they knocked on the door saying they had no opportunity to make their point.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or members of religious minorities have imitated their move.
To make room for the new recruits, 11 replacement members were rushed in yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, articles of the Constitution were often voted on unanimously.
Commentators further commented that one of the many controversies of the day revolved around... the prayer hour, when some committee members took the view that the clocks in the boardroom were not set correctly.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and provides that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is one of their fundamental demands, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", object the liberals, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
They claim that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which gives al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular on the issue of controlling the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
This is worrying, according to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, because "the people who are called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen as the beginning of theocracy".
The liberals' fears are further fuelled by the fact that the next university president should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, no specific religious implication has been demonstrated.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema but university staff, many of them graduated from French schools", says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a paper on constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be differences of interpretation on Article 220, since the terms used therein belong to the religious vocabulary.
There is a particular reference to fiqh.
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to express themselves on this".
The text passed yesterday is being heavily criticized, in addition to its religious aspects, for the extended powers it grants to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in their numbers compared to the previous regime.
Another controversial area: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military leaders, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, the military courts will not be prohibited from dealing with civilians, as demanded by the Human Rights Association.
These associations have expressed their doubts about the text, which they consider to be anti-freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is preserved and the offense of libel is prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are greeted by holy sites, the navel of the world, and a sea of saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truth, modern conveniences, and the unspoiled nature of the land.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
To visit the River Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God's mercy is poured out on all who enter this "bath".
And Galilee - the site of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm and filling a net.
Jesus also appeared to his disciples here after his resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Here, believers walk the Way of Sorrows, or Jesus' Way of the Cross (Latin, Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on the hill of Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, to the anointing stone and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the spot where, according to Christian legend, the tree grew from which they made the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem also contains the holiest place for the Jews - the Western Wall, a remnant of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Tradition has it that people of different faiths leave notes of wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take the road vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Masada are the remains of a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The wreck lies on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are trained in mountaineering can reach it by themselves.
The rest of us will take the cable car up this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600 to 2,040 meters, is the famous ski resort of Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists during the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists from the foot of the hill to this skiing paradise.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the mountain was said to be the home of pagan gods.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, along with some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
His exhibition is widely represented by his paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Baths Museum, which presents several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of bathers and bath-worshippers from that era.
In Caesarea, the unique private museum of Ralli is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly declined.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells one of the most dramatic stories in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in, and it's pitch black.
The stars are twinkling.
And they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improving Your Health
Israel's three main spa resorts are located along the Mediterranean, Red, and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of these has a pool, a water park, a dolphinarium, and an oceanarium.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is a swimming spot during the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C] and the air is warmed to 75 degrees Fahrenheit [23°C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year long.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest point of land on the planet - at 1,300 feet (417 m) below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps even the ones who cannot swim afloat.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water, solank, and medicinal mud that can cure health problems like dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to heal your nerves.
Touch the mysterious past
It is protected by the old part of Tel Aviv - the Mediterranean city of Jaffa.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mention of this city is found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it's where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists do love the narrow lanes of the towels, named after the zodiac signs.
They say that if you cling to the walls in the alley of your sign, luck will be on your side.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries to have their pictures taken.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "take" the Crusader fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, please.
If you are going to Israel, you need not worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population in this country speaks Russian.
It is better to carry money in dollars than in euros, which can easily be exchanged for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
Buses are the main form of public transport, but Jerusalem has a rapid tram system, and Haifa has the only metro line in the country with six stations, linking the lower city with the upper.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Traveling by all forms of public transport costs 6 shekels, which can take you 1.5 hours with a change of transport.
In Israel, the Sabbath is observed on Saturday according to Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, work stops at markets, shops, and public transportation.
And Sunday morning is the beginning of the work week.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only kosher food is available: all except pork, seafood, skinless fish, and meals that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a wide variety of dishes made with lamb and beef, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, the traditional Jewish porridge called hummus, a variety of sauces, ground garlic balls, falafel, and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Yet, there are many fattening cats that gracefully "roam about according to their taste".
In the evenings, they can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The leading cats love crowded places and will indulge in any goodness.
The cost of renting a car will range from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 a day (Audi A6, Volvo S80), depending on the make of the car.
Plus insurance - 15 bucks a day.
And it's about 15 shekels a day to rent a bike.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
To explore the country and relax, the most popular visitors were from the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised land was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" announces to Moscow: the emigrants save money for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, there are already fraudsters in the country who sell "forged" certificates
Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities are visited annually by 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support their families back home.
On December 1, a law came into force that will require all migrant workers to pass a Russian language test.
For now, this rule only applies to those intending to work in the service, housing, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that in time, the appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the examinations will not only consist of language skills, but also Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
Language proficiency will also be required for obtaining and renewing a work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
The law does not apply to people who successfully obtained a certificate and an academic diploma before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Enjoyment, conviction and protection of rights
The network of test sites will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the exam in all cities; there are already more than 160 such centers in Russia.
The initiative to promote the introduction of testing was also supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law was enacted, human rights activists were able to ask the question many times in the press: what will it actually bring?
What does the language requirement change for Russians and for visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service responded, it would reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labour".
Many people today are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, the chairman of the board of FMS Ruska in Tajikistan.
Their rights should be protected before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with immigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowing the language, Sebelev says with conviction, the prospective migrant is condemned to clash with dishonest people who, under the guise of helping him, will provide him with a "pass" to the dreadful, cramped hostels where he and dozens of others like him will starve for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but upon arrival they are deceived, their passports are confiscated, they do not pay the promised wages", confirms the head of the Tajik General Administration of Labour Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't give me that!
The fact that many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work, admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but they do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it's not so much their fault as their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a decent basic education.
After all, their families need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, groomed, and equipped for school.
As children reach productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
True, with regard to the language test law, human rights advocates point out one important point.
Testing will be conducted only on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't pass the exam, nor get any other official job.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Uninvited is prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers say that it is not easy to get official status in our country.
The reason - the bureaucratic hurdles and all the language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake license can be obtained quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we have essentially fake documents, no registration, and that leads to cases of extortion.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", Tajik citizen Umed Shukadamov told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself some paint".
On the first day of the language law, it was discovered that not only the registration documents of migrants are fake.
FMS staff have already seized several false certificates of passing a language test.
Forged documents are printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, they did not get them for free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the problem of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times more than taking the official test: it will cost migrant workers 3,000 rubles.
The main task for the near future is to make the system more secure against corruption, so that workers cannot easily buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, government agencies can promise foreign workers who failed the tests the first time to take a basic course in Russian.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas that do not require active interaction with people.
MVD does not circulate illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes involving legally held weapons is very low
The Russian MVD is proposing to tighten the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the government authorities to recent events, triggered by the shooting at a wedding that went off without a victim, and the massacre planned by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which a person can get a gun license from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaja, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the Russian government's attempts to deal with the problem by "turning the screws".
An open letter appeared on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various social organizations - demanded the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooligans with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist in an interview with the BBC's Russian edition.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 offences involving the use of firearms registered by the Ministry of Interior bodies were committed in the first six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the law on civilian weapons will not make the perpetrators to go to the "black" market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a low price.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The "black" arms market is supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baraniec, who worked for ten years in the offices of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that take orders for weapons
The first of these is "army or military road", meaning a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Kaukazes themselves", says Lamb.
Another type of "black weapons" are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement officials.
Barcane explains that this includes thefts from police stores and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "heads" are getting into the military warehouse.
Many military warehouses are frequently subject to explosions.
"It has been proven that some fires were started deliberately - to cover up the damage", says the ex-soldier.
Both arms manufacturers and Barance say they are contributing.
"Currently, private arms companies are emerging that are not competitive on the international market, and are phasing out the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow", says the expert.
Another source of black market money is smuggling.
Especially large numbers of pistols and automatic weapons come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"That's where they are made, sometimes the weapons are made in small scale, and the mafia has been created to organize the smooth production", explains the ex-soldier.
Where'd the gun come from?
The experts calculated the approximate share of each source of supply of illegal weapons on the 'black' market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Design in Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature, and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say the researchers, come from military and executive agencies.
Half of all guns found on the black market are "the fault of officials whose work is related to guns", says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of cases involve theft of weapons during their manufacture, 5% are "black archaeology".
A sales consultant for one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" are no longer being bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, the sellers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Despite the battalion, the prospective buyer will buy a unit, like a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, he sells it over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros each with two storage tanks", he says.
"The truth is that the police are well aware, and therefore whenever they start to have a plan in the investigation of crimes, they will make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers", the advisor adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers often find each other through acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until this guy showed up and offered me the opportunity to go to the "Trial Room" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "nook" where we would negotiate together.
I only found out the price there.
Military reporter Viktor Baranets is hereby appointed as the new Deputy Minister of Defense.
"If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out", says the salesman-advisor. "I have a friend, but I don't trust him completely.
The vendors are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell that his daughter's tooth fell out".
And now I'm getting there through a man I know for sure.
He also only delivers them to me, because he knows I won't deliver.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Ex-soldier Viktor Baraniec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working on a paper on the subject.
The patterns didn't change, according to him.
They gave him a photo album with "anything you can think of".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", the soldier recalled.
The buyer, according to the Lamb, is not offered a rabbit in a bag - you can try anything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the salesman to the woods and set up a target.
"It gives me the ability to shoot, and when I'm sure the gun is firing well, we take action", the expert describes the process.
The storage compartment on the couch.
Internet search engines take you to websites and groups on "Contact" that offer to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No paperwork or face-to-face meetings are required.
"Just have a certain amount of money", says the headline on the website "Buy a fighting pistol or automatic".
Users leave their notifications and questions on this site.
And selling to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks user "Ivan" (spelling is correct).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - is a short form of the requirement "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has recently cracked down on a vast network of hacked websites and people who wish to buy a military weapon can shovel it.
People are swarming like hungry fish on the bait, then they're mining coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military officer Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of such schemes: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photograph and a description of where the weapon is hidden", says Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the Right to Bear Arms NGO.
Viktor Baraniec confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can be left without a weapon and put behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently cracked a vast network of compromised websites, and individuals wishing to purchase a military weapon can scoop it up.
"People are lining up like hungry fish for bait and then mining for coal in Siberia", he confirms.
A $ 100 popcorn
Experts estimate that the cost of buying an illegal firearm is usually between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO Right to Bear Arms, you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month, maybe a month and a half.
The weapon is shipped from long-term storage through medium-stage storage.
According to the official statistics office, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period January-October 2011 to 22,9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
In the U.S. , fast food and supermarket workers are on strike .
A quarter of all American teenagers work at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has been rising in America against low wages at Walmart stores and popular fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether this wave will turn into wave nine or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole action is supported by the unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the meager wages that line workers at Walmart and the fast-food chain receive, the protest organizers are aiming to gain them a foothold in their union organizations.
At present, this sector of the economy is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales swept America, enthralling millions of residents and in some cases leading to a fight.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, walked off their jobs and demonstrated along with labor unions and left-wing activists of multinational retailers whose products are targeted to the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs to milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The availability and variety of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
Critics say that Walmart can afford to sell its goods so cheaply in part because it pays its employees so little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or hand-held scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded a pay raise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company had skyrocketed from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee earns $9.50 an hour, but that doesn't match the expense, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if Walmart were to raise the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That's an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries right now.
If Walmart were to shift the pay increase entirely onto the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store would cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, consumers will spend approximately $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart's lawyers point out that the protest was held in only nine countries and the company should have caused virtually no harm.
The company's "Black Friday" sales ran from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
In total, its teller machines processed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Company representative Dan Fogelman told the left-wing website Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees walked off their jobs, and that the protest was "just another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"The cash register is empty!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeting Walmart stores (which are not very popular in the advanced city, and therefore almost non-existent), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay your health insurance and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for labor in accordance with federal and New York state laws is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing this wage, but only modestly, and the average New York City line worker is paid $8.90 an hour.
Nobody in this expensive city has a lower salary.
I'm not sure how you can exist in New York City for that kind of money.
McDonald's employment will translate into almost a quarter of the American teenagers who work behind the counter after school into part-time jobs and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there long.
Now, I keep meeting with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there's a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum that says it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast-food restaurants start making at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be formed in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of trade unions and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, the government rarely makes their lives easier.
However, the introduction of trade union organisation in the fast food businesses is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, there were also loud protests at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the event was a rally at McDonald's near Times Square at noon, where several local Democratic politicians, most notably city councilman Jumaane Williams, spoke out, saying, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even pay you for sick leave and they don't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The protesters were also joined by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fast food workers so they can achieve the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food scene.
But only a few hundred people attended, though not all of them were employees of the fast-food chain that employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has been able to lie on average"
Among technology enthusiasts, virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; in recent times, it has meant seeing the world primarily through the lens of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, Google presented a working model of this innovation at its annual conference, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
An interview with Sharam Izadim, head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge Laboratory, suggests that for Microsoft researchers, glasses are a thing of the past.
The painting is a perspective manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Can you please tell us in more detail what your research group is doing?
- We're dealing with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we're trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in the pixel-on-flat screen stage, at most sometimes just touching the screen with the finger.
We want to look five to 10 years ahead and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor -- that's a step forward, and there's almost no Xbox on the market today without Kinect sensors, because it's very interesting for everyone to be able to control with gestures.
- What's the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has taken interaction to the physical level, a lot of interaction still happens on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not improved much.
We're trying to change that, working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, this requires knowledge not only of the user but also of the surrounding space.
Then we can add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first place, to hell with those stupid VR helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our environment about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interactions are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the operation of equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about vague gestures, just about those shallow, short ones.
The gesture would not be captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's big, but theoretically, it could be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future has a mixed type of control, like gesture plus voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say it and you show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Ah, that's going to be very difficult to identify.
So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can and can't do at a given moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a bonding.
I think in the near future, we're going to have to work on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a relatively good depth resolution, which is very important.
- Speaking of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can reflect off in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it's not just megapixels, it's also the nuts and the depth.
And in the current view of things, all the current technologies are not enough for us -- it's making it harder for the algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not just the X and Y, but also the Z.
So the speed, the number of frames per second is also very important.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flow of 30 frames per second is quite a bit, frankly, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 ms, whereas current mass-produced sensors are closer to the latter (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects human-machine interaction.
I could use a very useful equivalent of this in my work, but I don't need that many touches, but I need some extra images per second.
- And the increase in cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera -- it's actually a conventional visible-band sensor.
It's not used to determine the depth of an object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the amount of computation that we need to do.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect system, play around with the curvature of the camera's position, and see how that helps with three-dimensional positioning.
- As I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) has not publicly unveiled its glasses.
Don't you think that in terms of the everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and holding the smartphone in the upper hand all the time is not very comfortable, but I think the most powerful option would be a "portable" form of augmented reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone, projection screen and so on at any time, based on the cloud platform.
Glasses -- it's a very personal device, and that's where their strength is (private stuff is something only you can see), and also their weakness -- augmented reality glasses don't allow you to work on virtual objects with other people at the same time.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but to the average mortal.
There's one problem that critics often point out: there's no tactile response!
My hands are numb!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think adding the tactile senses could be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is using the other hand as a kind of substrate for the imaging.
It's got a great way of picking up the compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangible to these "airborne images" -- for example, interference of multiple directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, produces a tactile sensation, but it's still very faint -- as if you were blowing on the belly of your fingers.
There's also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you ever tried to fool the brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at a given moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here's another challenge that's going to be fought for a long time -- how to make a person who's physically in a very confined space believe that they're walking in an open, virtually infinite space -- we're also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, and also huge balls.
If the brain-deceptions become the goal, then the work is many years away.
That's what makes working in virtual reality so attractive to researchers -- a lot of stuff is in its infancy.
It's a taste instead of a culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already the major figures of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without achieving universal fame.
The new hero of "Rosbald" is the dazzling artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, the bearded man, dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashionable inns and at the open houses.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, the creator of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a prominent man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
Besides being a city man, his presence in the streets brings a smile to the faces of the citizens, raising the mood of all.
He recently took up the flute and became a St. Petersburg flute player, because he has matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city in red and not yellow or, say, turquoise?
- I chose red as a designer of appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and the public.
Although, in general, anything that differs from gray is aggressive and evokes bad traits.
But my provocations are aimed at getting a conversation going.
My entire history of provocative actions is primarily an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture on Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
At that time, there was a wave of old free-form artists, and I couldn't understand the new, free-form artists.
I made friends with the new wave artists, the post-Gazonav artists, who brought us to Pushkin's 10 and there were no other waves.
It draws me to the theater, to dress, to music, to all genres except speech.
- And all this was merged in your art-clinic ... - It was important for me to be in the center of culture of Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I took a place on Pushkinsky 10, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Petersburg, before the reconstruction.
There was a lot of NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how they brought the Strings with the "Van Gogh's Ear" project.
Shnur and his friends sang light songs, dressed in tight-fitting t-shirts, and in the middle of them was the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galilean times.
We gave him Trachtenberg, and his great career began, and he received his basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the sound of the Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and regulars go.
I'm a hero from the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
I was named Artist of the Year, and that was the end of my peak.
In the new times, working by the old rules is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
It's easy to become popular these days, but culture and popularity are different things these days, you can be popular but not very cultural.
- Your work is distinctive in a recognizable way.
Many of my paintings are hits, in which the urgency and the penetration are captured vividly.
I'm having a program exhibit called "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, but now it's painful and horrible.
But clowns are all about the drama, the tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have the grotesque.
Like saving the world by disguising a totalitarian order.
People meet by clothes, oriented to the outer mechanics, not the inner man.
Or maybe you can't reach out and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by the disguise.
- We saw you recently as the town's flautist. - A cultural town should have a hero like that.
And who should be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, utilitarian art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a culture collapse.
In the past, people used to gather in groups, the Bohemians loved one another, the common people.
Today, everything has broken down into micro-societies, and it's very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everybody.
Today, you have to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And the Stas Michailov will have several thousand spectators!
- It's where the fans come in, where the sexual social sphere comes in.
And the cultural landscape, 300 people come and 10,000 don't, and the result is less management, less money, everything goes.
I have fans, and the important thing is that no one cheats them and breaks the rules.
When I was young, I used to paint these pictures that hung on a collector's wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that people usually end up with.
People today often confuse terms.
They say: "Culture of the spirit, culture of the consumer".
There is no consumer culture, it's from somewhere else.
I'm a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for painting.
And I'm all for that culture.
- Cyril, what is missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a term for this: cross-cultural agent.
Not all of them can be cultural.
It wasn't always like this under the regular Tsars, the Tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support the real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck in a corner because we need great experts to evaluate these experts correctly and put them on the right track.
Today, the taste business is thriving.
But they differ in that they honestly say that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look elsewhere.
- What do you think is Peterburg?
- St. Petersburg - it's not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And in our corner, the arts are doing poorly.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers than readers today, that's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have a weak layer.
We need art to become a fashion thing, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with Earthlings on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the central question is how to keep our species in weightless conditions or on a given replacement planet.
I don't think the selection is that big.
In fact, there are only two planets that could be colonized, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P. K. Sternberg State Institute for Astronomy (SAIS).
But while conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Life is only possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To answer the question of reproduction in space, scientists began with the flora.
Experiments on plants were conducted half a century ago.
Four generations of peas raised in orbit are no different from their Earth-bound relatives.
Then, the launch of insects into orbit was made - the very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to observe the development of an embryo in a weightless state.
We get a perfectly normal bird on the way out.
But then the trouble starts.
"The problem is that this bird has to find support, has to stand on its own two feet and start moving", says Vladimir Sychev, the head of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) of the RAN.
If they don't find support, the birds fall chaotically and make a rocking sound.
After 10 hours, the instincts of the newly hatched birds have completely disappeared.
The birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the problem was, within four days, they were dead.
"Two times we had the birds hatched, but then we refused because it is simply impossible to work with them there", comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the chicken experiment in space.
The last miniarch to orbit animals was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But on the Bion biosatellite, there will only be beings of one sex.
An experiment was done with rats that were sent into space already pregnant.
They didn't actually find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, the space rats had offspring.
But we haven't been able to get close to the problem of reproduction in space.
It's a tough call.
Animals, when they lose their natural habitat, simply cannot fulfill their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has mastered abstract thought and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was facing the Tereshk family.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our tea bag flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive the flight into space.
I wonder if she can have a baby after a flight like that.
"This is a question that has not yet been answered", says Vachtang Wachnadze, a rocket-space industry veteran.
In June 1964, more than a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also a cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savicka, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in open space, was born.
But the risk remains.
We have very few astronauts who, after many years, are born and grow up healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital flights", says cosmonaut pilot Valery Polyakov, a Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia.
Yet, inevitably, mankind must find new ways in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrological laboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero gravity conditions, astronauts are learning the skills needed to work in open space.
Water is simulating weightlessness.
While for adults water is a comfortable yet somewhat strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
The small ichtianders seem to confirm that life on land came from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is in the mother's amniotic fluid for an average of 9 months and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
It makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks have passed.
"It's a very short time for a child to forget something", says Marina Aksenov, a newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for a newborn baby, then for women, inevitable gravity, attraction, is more natural.
In the weightless state, there is a very rapid decline in abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, decreased body's ability to expel the fetus.
We can rule that out if the muscle stimulators work during labor.
After all, it is possible that childbirth takes place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What next?" Valery Polyakov asks the difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
Without the force of gravity, an organism cannot properly form a skeleton or a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which it could train.
He's simply being deprived of what he needs to develop.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment", predicts the head of the IBMP RAN bioethics committee Igor Pestov.
So, the birth of babies in space is a theoretical question today.
But the time will come when it will be a reality, and the people of Earth will sail in their ships to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the National Security Council: Control of the black market failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and good legislation in the area of public procurement, but it is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuelne.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Control Office Miloslav Kala said:
"The law will never be perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - that's what I think we lack", Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar conclusion is also suggested by the joint audit of the Czech and German auditors.
As an example of a bad practice, he cites Peter Nečás' approach to the so-called "swartsystem".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the businessman with its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if he bans something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the office from functioning, which has the duty to monitor and enforce obligations", Kala states.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was it about?
It's a parallel audit that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have combined all this, and although the control is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "more rigorous and perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is thus confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but that it is necessary to deal with the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually do for you, what does it mean to you?
Such joint controls could help to stop efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits, when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (but not always the lowest price) to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal activity.
But lowering the limit on prohibitions may not necessarily achieve that.
Maybe the system is so overwhelmed by paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will find it much easier to draw on than if the limit were kept higher.
You're talking about the domestic problems of putting public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an office similar to our NKÚ, or is it set up differently?
As for the offices, just like the NKU there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly to us, also has a college, only it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices act similarly.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but because Germany is a federal state, the Court of Auditors also have powers at the level of the individual Länder - in this respect the system is a bit different from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the counties and municipalities in our country, are controlled from the level of the federal accounting courts.
What about the laws there, are they simpler than ours?
I don't like to compare it without specific data, but in some ways Germany is often called the model, but it's not always better.
Is it because they have better controllers?
I'm sure you didn't, but I'll say it again, I don't like comparisons.
But even the countries we think of as role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, there's no benefit to them from cooperating with our agency, is there?
As for the domestic legislation, which the amendment of the Public Procurement Law meant for your office, are its effects already showing?
Since the amendment is relatively short-lived, it has not yet been reflected in our control actions.
Since we're doing an ex post check, we have to expect some delay.
We are only seeing this in the process of preparing for future controls - we have started our new 'risk detection of uneconomic' tool, through which we have run almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - where the changes will naturally be reflected, because the limits will change, the conditions of certain types of tendering will be adjusted and so on.
So, do you see the passage of this bill as a benefit or as a burden on the bureaucracy?
I think this bill is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it proves to be.
The problem that can arise is that the rules become "tougher" and it is impossible to follow them.
Under the previous rules, the controlled persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is there any point in making the law stricter in this way?
I mean, not like this.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and exploit it, and not punish those who commit formal errors that do not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
How do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the businessmen with the controls of the so-called "swarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the jacket system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be set up somehow, and if he prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to go and check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it", but he can't say, "We'll just do nothing".
The Public Procurement Act has fairly strict rules about what formally has to be done - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best offer is eliminated for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - that's what I think is lacking in our country.
The roads are frozen in places, but mostly passable.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
But most roads are still passable, with some caution.
The County of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovar region this morning, the roads were passable, but in places frozen and also snow-covered.
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero, but it's expected to warm up slightly during the day.
Snow has stopped in the region and only a thin layer of snow lies in the lowlands.
However, the crest of the Ore Mountains is covered by about a foot [30 cm] of snow.
There was also some reduced visibility due to fog, according to the county highway dispatchers.
The R6 motorways and first class roads are now free to use in the region.
However, caution is in order, for example, on some bridge spans where the surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
But in some parts of the mountains, there are still remnants of frozen snow and parts of melted snow.
Particular attention should be paid to the driving position, especially in the higher positions.
Pardubice and the Royal County of Hradec
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by snow, and in higher areas and in the mountains, the roads may be covered with snow, reports the Directorate of Roads and Highways on its website.
Road guards warn drivers of the possibility of freezing, especially in the higher parts of the Pardubice region.
The area around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlíčí, Polička, Svitav or Vysoký Mýta can be spotted, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Krkonoše and Orlikaya Mountains.
The snow cover is at the highest points on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In the eastern part of the Czech Republic, the weather is mostly clear with no rain.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degrees Celsius, with a light wind.
The region of Plzeň
Roads in Plzeň region are cleared this morning, but places with increased caution and driving must be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After a previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
Drivers must take the fog into account, but visibility will gradually improve.
According to the county highway dispatch.
The D5 motorway is almost free of restrictions, but road officials recommend increased caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry, frosty surface.
However, there may be some areas of freezing in southern Plzeň and Tachovsk.
Second and third class communications are wet and also in this case the warning for frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be careful especially on less-frequented roads in the Šumava area.
The Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest peaks of the Olomouc region must expect snow to fall on the road today.
After the chemical spraying, she stayed on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road towards the Videlsky Cross.
The snow forced the road builders to the terrain at night, according to the road managers, about three centimeters of snow fell on the road in Šumperska.
In the rest of the county, the roads are mostly unrestricted.
"Snow remains at the highest points of the Sumper.
With a snowball on the Červenohorsk saddle, drivers must count on the direction of Jeseník", said today the dispatcher of the road traffic control administration.
Their colleagues at Jesenicka also ventured out into the field at night, and they say that the roads to the highest point are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are open to all traffic, but in Šternbersk, drivers should be careful in forested areas where the roads remained wet.
The following is the list of the municipalities of the region:
Several hard-to-reach areas are reported by motorists in northern Bohemia this morning.
Apart from a few places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústec is closed, according to the police database.
The temperature is below freezing in the lower parts, so the roads are likely to be covered by ice and snow.
No operational complications have been reported yet.
The occurrence of the iceberg is reported by road workers especially from the area of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night was ideal for her - rain and melting snow by day, clear and freezing by night.
The main routes also report adverse conditions on the I/13 road on the border of the Usti region and Liberec.
The closure of the road from Telnice to Knínice was forced by the bending of the branches of the trees, which were bent to the roadway under the snow cover.
Shimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the world ending in less than a month?
It's just another one of those scary news items that we humans like to grab.
The Tap Tap and I are making a joke out of it, saying that we are the only band in the world that can muster up enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also be hosting a unique project, three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you give our readers a closer look?
It's a national benefit that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, from 9 pm, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
It was my idea, but we came up with it with our designer Honzo Augusta.
In addition to building up enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how we will one day pass this world on to our children.
To celebrate the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of original anti-doomsday shoes, T-shirts, bags and keys, which people can also support by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap also sang a so-called anti-end-of-the-world anthem called "End of the World Cancelled".
She's already a big hit on YouTube, she's playing at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
It's sung by all the artists in all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will also be simultaneously broadcast live on Czech TV.
The lyrics to this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also sings Xindl X...
How did you get involved with them?
We also work with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize many charity events and concerts...
We're trying to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What's the end of the world concert revenue gonna do?
To equip the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civil society association Tap in Jedlička.
Students are regularly attended by tutors and are engaged in activities that are fun and interesting for them.
Students don't have the resources to become lecturers themselves, so we try to give them that opportunity in this way.
As part of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, separate buildings will be built in the future, into which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several bands and performers.
What did you use to pick them?
We've tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague there will be performances by Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombing" operations in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will surely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, since we are in the US, I would like to connect it with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your international plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks.
We have five members on an electric cart, whose carts must travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we have to haul a lot of cargo and tool boxes...
However, so far it has always been managed without problems, both CSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, which I was surprised by many times.
Even in Moscow, which we recently returned from, it was no problem.
And so, with the traveling abroad, you can compare how different countries are in their accessibility, in their access to the disabled, and so on.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than here, we have just witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is just beginning.
Moscow is very barrier-free compared to Prague, and it is still unusual for a person to travel alone on an electric trolley in the city center.
Nor is there any obviousness, like you prefer wheelchair users in the elevator.
Fortunately, civil society organizations are also emerging to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
And what do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind on...
But it's important to note that the improvement of a situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it's quite common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to be actively involved in social life, but we're a little ahead of the curve with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being unfettered is one thing, but it's only when we become great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really start to change.
So far, these are the rare cases of people who have strong wills.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band these days, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I started as an educator at the Jedlicko Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, playing saxophone among other things, I've started a musical interest group with a colleague.
And as our host Lada Angelovich says, over time, it got a little out of hand.
But it's only been in the last few years that it's become popular, or am I wrong?
True, it helped us to start associating with well-known singers and to work actively to promote the band.
We realized that work that isn't seen is essentially like it doesn't exist.
And thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford to have good lecturers, equipment, and so on.
Was it your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of things where one mimics the other.
It's logical in a way, everything new is accepted cautiously and takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression on a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But this regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned creatures that we should feel sorry for.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I say that when something is done for people with disabilities, it's not just a change for them, it's a change for society.
Did your success also come from being the tough boss, as many people have called you?
To do good work, we must be uncompromising in many ways and must be disciplined in some.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to rehearse twice a week, attend prep and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, their enthusiasm quickly fades.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap Band currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there when it started in 1998?
There is only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's unstoppable.
If you want to, we'll open the door for you.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague, Incheba Arena, Brno, Fleda and Ostrava Plynojemu with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected by telemetry at the end of the evening, as they all sing The Tap Tap's song, "The End of the World Has Been Cancelled".
The concert aims to raise funds for the equipping of a multifunctional barrier-free STUDEO educational center at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years old have free admission tickets in advance Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, the European Space Agency (ESA) welcomed Poland as its 20th member, the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008) at a meeting of ESA ministers.
Poland started working closely with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of ESA projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Polish space enthusiasts had been flying into space before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933, in which he presented ideas from his pioneering work, Introduction to Cosmonautics.
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his contribution to cosmonautics in France.
The late Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great proponent of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was recognized by having one of the craters on the far side of the Moon named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway train was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown, and the details of the project are unknown.
It's not even clear whether the rocket was meant to be used to launch the thrusters or to brake them.
Information about this drezin is known only from the contemporary press.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to use rocket fire.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolczek and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the surviving material, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, the arrival of German troops interrupted the research.
In 1937 the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwy-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were handled by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activities ended with the beginning of the war.
Further works devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the post-war Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of the company is in the November 1954 issue of Problems magazine, which has four more extensive articles devoted to astronauts.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, the artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first flight was on 10 October 1958.
The 1,800-meter-range rocket was about three feet long and weighed less than 10 pounds.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bledovo Desert.
The rocket was four feet long and weighed about 30 pounds.
The next developmental type was to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to track high-altitude winds.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch mass of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A had a 0.4 litre capacity, the Meteor-1B had a 0.34 litre capacity and the Meteor-1C had a 0.62 litre capacity.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of the Meteor-2 rocket was carried out at the Leteck Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequent versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national COSPAR committee two years later are also worth mentioning.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos program, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the public works law.
The resolution sparked lively public debate.
It will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the different economic entities, the national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unrestrained financial speculation.
The effect of significant differences in the price of labour (wages) is price tension.
This term should be understood as meaning that a producer is trying to survive in competition by importing cheap goods, 'cheating' a competitor's price in order to gain a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to move production abroad, buy cheaply or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is exacerbated by the total unwillingness of the businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage to society as a whole that they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistics need to be provided.
The reckless practices of private capital create in individual economies a situation where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to their own population regardless of social decline.
This is reflected above all in changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force the population to accept the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done through systematic economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and by restricting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with a widening gap between the poor and the rich.
For many years, public food distribution centres have been established in the GDR for the poor who cannot earn a living by their own labour.
The number of these people is now in the millions.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people in a regular job to receive a salary that the state has to compensate them for the subsistence level.
A similar scandal was revealed in the case of the auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.
Savings policies in virtually all of the southern states of the EU are unquestionably leading to the same situation, where people are forced under the pressure of catastrophic social collapse either to emigrate as they did in the 19th century, or to live on hunger wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But the question is, where does it come from?
If it's from other EU countries, then the poverty is moving from one country to another, or not coming at all, because the Chinese, the Indian, the Brazilian, or the Turkish, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, or the African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This is all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media, to their dismay, claim that the state cannot participate in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is adamant that the state must not interfere with the economy by controlling it.
Then you have to ask whether private capital is not influencing, is it not actually now driving politics and therefore the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's a definite answer to that.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in corruption, in the granting of mutual benefits, in a legislature where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing is.
The situation in the GDR is such that, due to a lack of funds, the state ministries commission private law firms with close links to industry to draft laws.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as the Western-style constitutions claim, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly entering a situation described by Appian in his Crisis of the Roman Republic under Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disrepair, and the authorities have been seized by force.
For bribery, for illegal favor, and for using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any hindrance and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote "..." people of character did not take office at all, so once there was a state for eight months without consuls as a result of this disorder "..." It began to be said that the only remedy in a bad situation is self-government and that an energetic man should be chosen "... "Appiano thought of Pompey, but became Caesar, who changed democracy permanently into autocracy.
Conclusion As in antiquity, today's society is based on the ruthless preference of self-interest over the interest of the community at large.
Private capital is no longer by its very nature capable of understanding and applying the good of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite without any attempt at deeper reform.
The causal basis for the rise of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be found in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-style democracy can be seen as a kind of pause, waiting for the next round.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the potential future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing along with the crimes against humanity as we know them from both old and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from competition both at international and at intra-European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways of further reducing the social standard of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing comes from violence, and it never can" Sting in Fragile, whose main line in the chorus is "don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no war" dying Gutier Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there has been, as always, a lot of backlash.
Some support Israel, argue its right to self-defence and put the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and put the State of Israel in the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the culprit and who is the victim in the periodic waves of killing, after all, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, a glimpse of who has been the primary beneficiary of the 95 years of tension (counted from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reasoning is supported by the available historical facts, some of it is derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
Human history is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can trace the trail of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less clear is whether these were always the personalities who were completely autonomous in directing their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must accept that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have happened in the lifetime of a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be considered the head of the octopus (if there is still anyone standing above them I don't know, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
They're not much of a story.
I can understand that.
They bought their first news agency, Reuters, back in the 1890s to stop their name being associated with the high-profile criminal acts that they were behind, which for them always meant consolidating power, multiplying wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the world's central banks and against countries where the stakes in the central bank are not being waged or prepared for wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, there were only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore Rothschild's Bank of America to central bank status, started issuing his own (i.e. government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led them to formulate a plan for three world wars between 1859 and 1871 by the Masonic High Priest, 33rd Degree, initiated by Albert Pike.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states in Europe, the second was to eliminate the colonial rule, especially of Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (there are enough slaves for their comfort and luxury and they don't consume as many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a precursor to such a solution), and the final assumption of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, use is to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED in order to avoid a repeat of the crisis like the one they caused in 1907).
So after they succeeded in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg successor to the throne, Ferdinand R-U, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended suddenly, militarily and economically unjustified, with the surrender of Germany (no longer needed for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers let politicians create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating the assumption of radicalization of the deprived masses, and then they only had to push the Germans with a sufficiently strong, vines marking and simple solution offered by the Führer and further by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should have played, and also played, the role of a fifth column in igniting the war fire.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created the conditions for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke free of the chains that initially held him by the international bankers, or all that he had planned to do is difficult to estimate, but in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and just as war reparations were paid to Germany for World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel was the focus of World War III.
If the international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in the second, will be the first line of the battle, now along with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos not only within the country but also on an international scale (just consider how sharply people divide themselves into those who are for and those who are against Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power was at the root of everything?
Here, we must distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers are giving the people the choice of their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to escalate into a global conflict and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to destroy the world economy.
What is the truth of David Rockefeller's words in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order".
The new world order they envision is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the convenience of a handful of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes them a totally controlled being.
"And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and that no one may buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.
This is the understanding: Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast.
The number is the number of a man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six".
When the worst is over, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamic students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - to throw the shah overboard was not something they could afford, because it would fundamentally jeopardize the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages was not possible in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their plight at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iran debacle was a major contributor to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Ben Affleck's directorial Argo depicts one episode of that story that brought America a minor victory.
Just before the embassy was taken, six staff members fled the embassy.
After a complicated periphery, they ended up at the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, working with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, using an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of a film crew in the country scouting locations for a major sci-fi film.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, but the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, on the other hand, a "caper movie", a story of a set piece, a deception - an example of this is the Danny's partner series.
The film alternates between moods - on the one hand, a documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs of the events and the way the same situations were presented in the film - there are no major differences).
On the other hand, a light-hearted Hollywood passage, mixed with irony and a little exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the conference tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has had a remarkable career reboot.
From a mocked-up actor, he became a respected director, and his acting was no longer the subject of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The City (2010).
It's also the first Affleck film not to be set in the director's hometown of Boston.
But a sense of place was one of the characteristics that made the director's older films stand above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is showing it at the Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, while conveying the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that comes when the story is set in a clear-cut place.
Affleck and his associates achieve a similar effect in staged scenes (a fake crew at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told didn't really offer much in the cinematic sense of thrilling scenes.
He works quite successfully with this little, sometimes he thinks about reality - everything doesn't come out so elegantly there (the scene in which the threatened crisis at Tehran airport turns off the phone in America and the chase for the ranch looks attractive enough for the hair).
But Arga's weakness is the distraction that comes from having to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming as Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and they are far from alone in this film.
Affleck's film loses some of its dramatic thrust, and it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciated for its execution and retro style that evokes the thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to pull off.
As a reminder of a still-certainly living history and a testament to how far-fetched the notion of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services is, but enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflating
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually puts out a survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to launch a competition for the 'most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop'.
"We were led to this by the latest event, where the EU is planning to adopt a 40% quota for women in the leadership of large European companies", said Patrik Nacher, organiser of the poll, to Pravo.
Among the absurdities mentioned is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favored in life insurance rates because they are objectively less risky to the insurance companies.
"The next incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of the year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blending of bio-based ingredients into fuels, which damages the environment, the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, and the chicken cage size directive, which caused a sharp rise in the price of eggs this year.
The criticism was previously also faced by the de facto ban on the use of the term 'butter' or the withdrawal of traditional light bulbs from sale.
The quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimeters long
The EU apparatus often makes decisions under pressure from business or industry lobbies, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (even the Czech Republic is now using the threat of veto to enforce the demands of its banks).
The lobby also insisted that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to be at least 14 cm long and not have 'abnormal curvature'.
The European Commission defended itself by simply harmonising the existing non-uniform national standards that have made trade more difficult.
The EU has already relaxed its fruit and vegetable standards, despite the opposition of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation requiring that inflatable balloons be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate without adult supervision may also be a candidate to win the poll.
The EU cited US research showing that balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation among children.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 years of age when blowing into hiking boots.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule regarding the European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone in an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The BankingConsulting.com server, in cooperation with the Laissez Faire association of liberal economists, nominated for the poll, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, also the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum quantities of food stocks that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the set limits for canned mushrooms, for example, and was threatened with a heavy fine.
The survey organisers were also intrigued by the idea of paying countries to be landlocked and the idea of granting subsidies to the request for a grant.
But these ideas were not born in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the lack of sea.
We are asking the European Union for a refund,' said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that we had a lot of grain and that as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the warehouses were full and he had to take them out.
For the Czech Republic to continue to have access to its ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally came to the aid of the Czech Republic by organising a tender to buy cereals from landlocked countries.
The grants were offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Paul Niemiec (US-DEU), specifically to help with the application for grants from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulation is often the subject of criticism in the Member States, many experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to make the whole Union work and develop more effectively deserve greater recognition.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the use of EU funds for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced upon the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The Czech Republic is also excited by the fact that, like other EU countries, it has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific labels for its traditional products, and it does not always succeed in this fight.
Although after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs have abandoned the designation of Olomouc rum, but the local rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers to Tuzemak.
Only products made from cane distillate and not from sugar beet may bear the rum designation.
The official list of EU products already included such products as Karlovy Vary, Požuric and Třeboň carp and Zate hops, in the company of the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, and Parma prunes.
The EU trademark also covers the red-headed partridge and the fire-tube.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how does a man think he's running for president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or a president.
If it works in this country without problems, I'm not running.
But I can't stand to see the country being looted for the last 20 years, with thieves running around, people getting tax rises and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm a non-partisan independent, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but then you went to the Castle.
Isn't that turning your back on the people who elected you?
I've said all along that I'll go into the Castle with the results of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if elected as a senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function, the function is a tool to make my vision come true.
That's why I need the biggest influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a nation swear in pubs and on television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Added to this is the media that de-honest humans and that confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I've been accused of bribing journalists or being an adviser to George Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You've gone to the battle for the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property confessions over twenty million.
You'd have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you don't have that power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to handle this?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make escorting a free profession, it worked.
The problem is politicization - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, it's purposely rejected, and that holds citizens back.
As an independent non-party candidate, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties in Parliament.
My preference is that without partisan boxing and dogma, I can take what's best for our country from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing person or a left-wing person?
From a Czech perspective, I think people tend to line me up to the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone is left or right, I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSCM or the ODS, and I will be just as against the bad idea.
You joke when someone says you're a populist.
But you don't prove it by what you said?
When you're creating a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get close to it.
Some might call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by leading experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll have nothing but slogans.
And that's not what you're going to do in politics for the long haul.
Or do you think that if you go out and talk to people, you can get them to take on criminal and financial responsibility, for example?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public to try and get them on our side to make it happen.
If I were elected president, I would have no problem hosting a live television broadcast where I would ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate for the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they would have to tell us why they don't want it.
If you have a strong personality who can name the non-violent, you can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, that was due to public pressure.
I'm just saying that I'm an amateur, that I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm looking for allies for my views and visions.
I'm just starting out in politics, and I'm going to try to get the majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things along myself, and if that doesn't work, I'll be out of the business in six years and back in the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything in one person, so I've been rounding up a number of famous people to see if they'd run for the Senate as well.
I went to see Radej Jančura, he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist, Jan Lorentz, who exposed the fraudulent use of light fuel oil.
I ran with people who were really unhappy, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people didn't vote, and those who did vote tended to vote for the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have so manipulated the Senate that it will be difficult to push through change.
I will still fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or aldermen.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have the time to check the clean records of every potential party, and I don't have the money.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, and my transparent account is only 20 grand.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, what's yours?
Private assets I'd put at about $60 million.
I have a property in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of art for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a couple of million in my account.
I got an Aston Martin, by the way, because it was my boyhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove around, was gentle with women, and fought against evil and bad manners.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own $60 million worth of real estate, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
I'm supposed to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that there's probably not that much interest in my program.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The cost of my campaign will be covered by what I'll be getting in my senator's salary.
But I couldn't make a living, like, I couldn't pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't be running for office.
So you're going to keep your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd curb these activities?
But it's not about the salary.
As promised, I've partially curbed my activities.
For example, the travel agent will be my deputy in the spring.
The people would want me to be the Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much did you take per month as a businessman?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I'm taking.
And if I were president, I'd shut down my business.

The MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not just in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Book Mountain - 2 pictures
"The building seems cheerful, it looks futuristic, finally there is something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, walking along the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large firm, says: "Of course, the house is nice".
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
They all have the Internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-fashioned libraries are open to the public anymore, are they?
Spijkenisse, a settlement just outside Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own, and not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality, with a population of 80 000, has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
To remedy this absurd situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to universal education by building seven beautifully painted concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the education offensive was not overwhelming.
And so the city council realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of wildly daring column plots and a maker of funny, often even cynical constructions, took the matter with his usual calmness and appeared at the 2003 competition with five books under his arm and a grimace on his face.
And while the committee was still looking around in awe and shrugging its shoulders, the bold Maas threw his gifts at himself in order of size and ended his activist-motivated speech with the words "Dear city people!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was finished for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office, and several adjoining residential and row houses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, the Mountain of Books was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town shed, which could not have offered more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an extremely ugly town hall, whose white facade you would expect to be a dairy, is now enriched by a little bit of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: the reading of the Eldorado under the cheese lid.
Although there is an elevator that goes through the mountain, the real spatial and reading passion is found only when the topography is climbed on foot.
The glass interior is bright and clear from all sides, and the floor is made of burnt cabbage and the elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, and a dog, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And books everywhere, books, books.
"Normally, bookshelves line the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark space that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader space out from the inside.
The interior of the Hill of Books is well-designed: in the center are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center, and a home technology center.
A special treat are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes walls, sometimes windowsills, and sometimes railings.
The look, the texture, the smell, it's all very strange.
Even the most experienced architects and civil engineers are baffled by the unknown building materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here", says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, to the Standard.
And so, at a farm in Frisch, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product one day.
For many years, millimeter-sized rounds of synthetic material have been used as a substrate under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
Thin fabric lasts one or two seasons and then is ripe for disposal in a bulk landfill.
For the library, the fern - the first of its kind - was cut into boards four centimeters thick.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (LBP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, and heavy-duty material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoe.
105 steps to the top.
At the end of the almost 500-meter-long walk, you will be rewarded with not only a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in flower pots at the literary café.
They're concerned with the atmosphere, but more importantly, with the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You may not believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is an example of an ecological project", says Trouborst.
It's heated and cooled by the earth's heat.
Although the Book Mountain is covered with a glass dome, the sun shines in for only a short time, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden beams perpendicular to the glass facade serve as shading and capture much of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the work will be done by fully automatic shutters.
Spermon, an early skeptic in the IT industry, Stefan has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, whom Boekenberg even refers to as the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every citizen of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate a book from their personal collection.
The first step was to fill the optical gaps in the incompletely equipped library, which now contains 70 000 items.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Wina Maas.
"I think that because of our invitation, each resident now has a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
So the MVRDV has become a king in the discipline of what's known in the technical jargon as identity formation.
Spijkenisse was writing the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
It's the starting point for identity, after all.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a bigger role'
Germany abstained from voting on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to US-European relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the fringe of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why would you do that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany doesn't support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
That was eventually adopted by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on important international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that they are changing their foreign policy, and that is from a policy that was so-called US-driven, towards a German foreign policy.
The situation is made more difficult by the lack of coherent and unified European policies.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just getting their act together, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or in the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
Demonstrates a willingness to engage with national interests and positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other great powers, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the stance in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has a large presence in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
So they have to be careful not to scare the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It does matter.
I don't want to put too much weight on it, but it's not a one-sided relationship.
But it is a major factor in German thinking.
Did Germany's relations with the U.S. deteriorate when Germany abstained on both important decisions, for example the vote on Palestine?
I think there's a lot of sympathy in Europe and even in the United States for the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic a turn of events as Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
This signals that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has made it clear that it is for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have existed as a result of American domestic policy always.
I think the Obama administration has a pretty good grasp of the European position.
But, of course, given the political situation there, he can't take that position publicly.
I think the differences in opinion are really not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand and its position as the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a larger line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
That's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take on the lead role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
If you look at the European crisis, for example, whenever Germany takes on a bigger role, anti-German sentiment is created.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be acceptable to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
The US influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling the vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more uncomfortable - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are Chinese together
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
What is an Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name that is fully registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
It shall nevertheless enjoy protection until the actual owners of the trade mark have brought proceedings against it.
And even then, it's unclear if they'll get the law.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, which specialises in infringements of intellectual property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The counterfeiters need a few more letters to get their badges.
Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci, for example, and instead of Prada, they get Prada-Kny.
German companies, like the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied in this way.
Pattloch is opening the register of the Beijing stamp office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese firm had its trademark, Zegna DF Puma, protected there, a name that also parasitizes the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are the masters of the world in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several storey shops, where counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
But Pattloch's cases are different, because he is acting on behalf of his clients against the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a trademark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an affiliated brand.
This word is targeted at "Bang Dakuan".
That's what they mean by women who chase rich men.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any guilt.
"It's hurting business, we have to deal with it", says Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive status is gone, the damage to the image is immense".
The financial losses and legal costs for the affected industries are in the millions, especially for expensive samples.
According to CLSA, a market research company, China is the third largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing one, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, erasure of questionable entries in the register of trade marks can be difficult to achieve and costly.
The trial can go on for up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court rejected the lawsuit because the name had become a "market reality" after a long time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, the plagiarer still has to pay because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are known cases involving graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, which had recently taken over the German concrete mix pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that looks like a Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, and Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few staff and space.
But last year, it was reported that "the work process had returned from emergency to normal".
For example, the number of unresolved objection procedures fell by 22%.
Fifty-seven thousand of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
However, the Office still has 81,500 complaints to deal with.
It 's expensive to do something about it .
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
That's a record, and it means that China is now leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the 10th time in a row.
This is also the case for the number of all valid trade marks - there are 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected on fees.
Simply put, each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
The case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows that it is costly to bring a dispute against this.
This company has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for over seven years.
The Germans did get his illegal production of counterfeit auto parts stopped.
However, the counterfeiter retained the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have forgotten about it ourselves, because in Germany surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich company's objection.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg won the law, but he continues to fight his opponent in the dispute to this day.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will be brought to a successful conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "It is extremely costly to govern, and it takes a lot of time, money, and nerves".
The internal costs are incalculable, and the firm's archives have even had to search through centuries-old records to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty a "high six-figure sum in euros" to settle the dispute, but in vain.
"You can see what this means to us", says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East is threatening to spread to Europe.
And that's if the copycats are gonna get their hands on the unregistered marks.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to apply for the Freudenberg footwear and leather mark in Germany.
The group had long since abandoned this business, but it was nevertheless able to avoid registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
He and Attorney Pattloch are advising German businesses to be very careful when doing business with China.
Rather than rely on international trademark rights, Wentzler says, foreigners should "register anything worth protecting in China, whatever it might be".
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg were to lose its trademark in the final act of its drama, it would probably have to pay the other party the royalties for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in a contentious segment.
World AIDS Day: singing, helping and playing
In Heidelberg, the Iimbongi Congregation is trying out - and in Swaziland, orphans whose parents have died of AIDS are rejoicing.
A story of connection that spans far more than 8733 kilometres.
First, there's the kicking: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, women's paddle boots, and men's loafers look for a beat on the floor and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then, slowly, the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor, and soprano - press, pause, and interfere with one another.
The 29-year-old conductor of the Fiat Hopf almost lifts it from his textile shoes, as he combines his vocals with his trained wild gestures.
It's Monday night, and in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
It came from 50 singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human geneticist to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text and, furthermore, in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and parts of Swaziland.
Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that some 34 million people worldwide are living with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans whose parents died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 orphans whose parents died of AIDS in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend secondary school.
You can take out a patronage for 15 or 20 euros a month.
He guarantees the child's tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "praiser" in the Zulu language.
No one can speak Bantu in this room, just sing.
For nearly a decade, he has been training the choir to sing in this foreign, soft language, and occasionally he brings them back to where they originated: southern Africa.
At an altitude of 5,730 miles (8,733 km) from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the strength of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some in simple mud huts or thatched huts, and a large number of them are children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents to HIV.
And this is shown in a small picture of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in their bodies, and it's not uncommon for them to die in their early 30s.
The village was discovered by the congregation during a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, the members of the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a complete education, they have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was a private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But just a year later, a chorus of associations was formed, "Voices for Africa", which has since been caring for orphans whose parents died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most commonly reported viruses of SPI are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The mucous membrane and sclera are parasitic SPI.
Who are among the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
Sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently in heterosexual adults include chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections fall into this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, we have a high incidence of human papillomavirus in adolescents.
How has the number of infections been increasing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases have to be reported.
The number of people infected with syphilis more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms are indicative of a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may cause genital ulcers, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and so they go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce dangerous infections, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infections from feces and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially in cases of frequent sexual partnerships.
With early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and their subsequent consequences prevented.
Through patronage, charitable donations, and not least the fees the choir earns from singing throughout Germany, some money is raised.
"We have already sent about €200,000 to Estonia in total", says Annette Lennartz, the association's president.
The money from Germany is managed in the village by Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can make a living.
She also makes sure that orphaned children find a home, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu call the old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken in as many as 14 orphans, provided them with a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children arrive at school on time each day in their uniforms.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to the shelter of Khanyisile, a lonely woman paid by the community as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa has established a sewing school, set up two chicken houses, and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get tested for HIV.
It's not a given, but even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone keeps silent about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Quite strange, actually, in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his extravagant lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned way of life is to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
The culture is different - unprotected sex".
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Band travels to southern Africa once every two to three years, singing songs of grief, struggle, hope and self-confidence that many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the Negro language - such an award brings not only a feeling of cheer and joy but has already brought tears to many of the wild frontier soldiers.
The road always leads to Esteni, where the singers visit the children they have the patronage over.
Although this village is hardly on the map, it is well known in the valley of the Ezuloya River.
"Go to Esteni, there is light", people say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers from here, to the singers in the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Straße, you see that the light is shining here too.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury.
The MESSENGER spacecraft has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The MESSENGER probe has found evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 12 inches long and perhaps as much as 65 feet thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or even asteroids that have hit Mercury.
"We're not linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on this planet", said the lead scientist working on the Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and tiny robots like the Phoenix, unseen by Earthlings, are taking part in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, a small window into the infinite distances.
This image is from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, including the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition of the term.
This infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars, the oldest stars appearing as blue dots, the most difficult to identify being the pink "newborns" in the birth hall of the stars.
This star-forming region - scientifically known as W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, some 6,500 light-years away.
This changing glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer space telescope.
The ring is made of material that the star shed during its dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are being formed from gas and dust.
This image of the galactic cradle was taken by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.
The Pleiades constellation, also known as the Seven Sisters, is visible to the naked eye at night.
But the telescope makes the colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may appear to the observer in this infrared image as a red eye.
It's 700 light-years away from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the Earth continent earned this nebula the name North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography produces an extraordinary coloring.
This interstellar baby has been captured in all its glory by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they came to be is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps it's the remains of a moon of Saturn that vanished without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble Space Telescope: the spiral galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, depending on their coloration, become works of art.
The image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula, thousands of light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name triphid comes from the Latin word triphidus, meaning "three-sided", because the dark dust lanes divide the star's hot heart into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonous, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are polarizing and are bound to collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
For those who don't like technical abbreviations, you can call it the Southern Windmill.
This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a slice of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
This nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810 by scientists.
This stellar nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The cradle of the stars is always giving birth to new growth.
Also, this starry cloud, bound to the Rosetta Nebula, is constantly giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a tiny black hole, there is no dust yet, just gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, and before Galileo, Galileo used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are deeper and deeper.
The world's largest telescope was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
In the United States, Arizona is home to the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to peer into space through two mirrors, each measuring 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on La Palma, one of the Canary Islands, is huge, measuring an average of 40 feet [10.4 m] in the mirror alone.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet, it is about 35 feet [11 m] in diameter.
The disadvantage of the inexpensive design: the telescope is hooked at an angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light stream.
This is equal to the world's largest mirror telescopes, despite the mirror's relatively small diameter.
Using the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists are searching the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope is 1,000 feet in diameter.
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can be aided by any computer owner who will contribute their computing power.
A view of the observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope stands here and lives up to its name.
This telescope with its four mirrors can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
A European ultralarge telescope is also planned for ESO's Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters (141 feet) high and to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
The images can be expected in 2018 at the earliest.
The two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each measuring ten meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru Telescope and IRTTF to look into space.
A new giant telescope - with a 100-foot- [30 m]- diameter mirror - is also to be built on Mauna Kea.
You can admire it in the picture here.
But the most important images from space are those that the Hubble Space Telescope provides.
He has been providing images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets - especially those that are habitable - since March 2009.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of the mission, 1235 candidate planets had been identified.
This image documents the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket first in 2018.
The primary mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
But there are no reliable data for that, because the Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated that Mercury is frozen for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, launched in 2004 and the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day and you'll live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to see the Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Tracing in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to a Biblical age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Trace-seeking in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Riding the Talysh Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The microbus roars along a road with many bends along thickly wooded hills, treacherous rivers, and simple country houses.
Everything is green and juicy, it's almost like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of whom little is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The last stop is Lerik.
The town boasts monumental Soviet-era architecture that is out of place in the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists do not come here, and it is very difficult to get there from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku.
It takes eight hours to travel 200 miles [323 km] because the road is single-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to the oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world next year", says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the lives of nearly eight dozen Talish people from the area, who are over a hundred years old, are documented.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
He fathered a child at the age of 136.
The controversial star of the museum, however, is the sheepherder Şirali Müslümov, who was said to be 168 years old.
But there is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems highly questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayev explains.
This man was supposedly married three times and had 23 children, and at age 136 he was said to have fathered a daughter.
So, did Şirali Müslümov not make a mistake in his age by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Germany, had heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also many elderly people in certain areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and there are also an extremely large number of very old men in Sardinia".
However, due to the lack of supporting evidence, no scientific proof of age can be given, especially when the matrices are missing.
A glass of butter every day
The fact is, though, that people in the area around Lerik live past the Bible age remarkably often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why, then, are so many elderly people living here in the South?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains it by the special genes of the Talysh.
The museum's director, Fatulyeva, believes it's all about the food.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy does not seem plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the primitive way of life that keeps people young?
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the floor with the butter mill, which he tirelessly rocks.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaev's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents by now.
Two little kids are jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for the guests, which is served in the typical "armadu" belly cups.
Mirzaeva's white teeth form a perfect row, and under her scarf she hides a long dark blond gown, which her son proudly unfolds before us.
I always washed my hair with milk so it didn't look like me and kept the color.
"I also never used shampoo", says Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate what came from her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peaches.
I've never once in my life bought groceries at a supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst since World War II.
But things improved when "dear father" Geidar Aliyev took over.
Propaganda sounds strange coming from an old woman.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan don't suffer from deprivation.
Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (about the same amount in euros), which is a good living wage by local standards.
And perhaps Mirzaev's long-grayed son is right: "Old people are highly regarded in our culture".
They live in the midst of a large family, and they are loved, cared for, and they are happy.
Unless it's a reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The term "human rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The unrestrained demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country's deep divisions.
There is a heated debate about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president spared no expense.
We need to create a transition.
"And for that we succeed, I am responsible, before people and before God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the nation as a whole, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
All those who are still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition are afraid.
Fear of a "God state" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said almost apologetically that he had temporarily limited the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his own jurisdiction to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians or the world.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
The 234 paragraphs that the 100-strong Constituent Assembly, with its Islamist majority, rushed to approve in a fifteen-hour night marathon, are partly cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the proposal states that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use this vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this is illustrated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters pertaining to Sharia, one should consult al-Azhar University, which is the most prominent Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on all Sunni Islam.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislature, which would bring the de facto revocation of judicial authority to the judiciary.
There are many things to be explained in the draft constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of military courts is to be maintained.
These courts were used under Mubarak to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, as many as 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The proposal also states that the state should protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values".
This is so legally vague that this paragraph could even allow the state institutions to control the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, it means nothing but censorship.
And no paragraph in writing explicitly defines equality between men and women.
However, another paragraph forbids to slander or defame the Prophet Muhammad and his emissaries.
But it remains unclear what the defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the formulation that "no human insult" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke on the legal profession enough in this case?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this bill, which Morsi will be putting up for signature and presenting to the Egyptians for a popular vote, according to his words, "very soon".
"The revolution is back"
For weeks, opposition has been building against the Islamist overwhelming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual numbers in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday night, vowing to destroy the constitutional charter before it takes effect.
"The revolution has returned and we are winning", said Hamdín Sabbahí, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, declared that the draft constitution belongs "in the dustbin of history".
Through the short message service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition member Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished", Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they will not oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared a protest, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafist supporters attended, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They called out to Mursi, "Clear the land!" and assured him, "The Koran is our constitution".
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably spark a civil war-like state.
The followers of Mursi clearly did not want to take any risks.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is going.
The majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, excites Hafiz Abu Sa'd.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And the new constitution now does not even mention the words 'human rights'", he complains in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's expansion of power to all three branches of government forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it", complains Sa'da.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which watches the clash of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be his revenge.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control".
Norway lobster: The world's most stinky fish?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be tied to a local appetite for the exceptionally stinky fish?
Have some overripe cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
So you get the paralyzing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's greatest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a beautiful view, and there's an omnipresent smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout that's been fermented in water for up to a year - depending on how bad you want the fish to stink.
As darkness falls and the cold begins to set in, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather for a festival dedicated to this, how to say, the best, most compelling food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small fish bones and drink them with large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk", says Havard.
The drink can smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that's been on a long bus ride.
The rakfisk is a product of a very different time in Norway, when poverty was rife and, because there were no refrigerators, fish were packed in airtight barrels with water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well-fermented, they were drawn out and eaten - no doubt numbed by alcohol.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their homeland in search of work, most of them emigrating to the United States.
The current population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by the large number of jobs, high earnings and extensive care systems.
The people of Sweden, an old rival that was not so long ago much wealthier than Norway, are flocking to the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as an important, indispensable, albeit rather smelly part of the Norwegian past.
It's one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) each.
Norway is often left out of the global news - and most of the population seems to be content with that.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children, is still spoken of with disgust here.
Instead, the shooting is being called the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway's present wealth is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says our waitress Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes is the prototype of Nordic prosperity, as she serves the plates with the rusty rakfisk.
We are, as you say, a considerate people.
Her English, like most people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't like to show off. We don't like to show off.
Norway treats its oil wealth very carefully - with the exception of a small percentage, most of the money from the industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else was throwing money they didn't have at the world in the years leading up to the global financial crash, the Norwegians had their strings tied tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And eat the crabfish", he adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in line in the snow for something to eat - I've had enough of the rakfis.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else, and it's deliciously juicy.
But tonight the stinking fish are here again.
The hotel where I stay is one of many places that serves rakfisk for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather, the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live TV broadcast in which the presenter with the butterfly is surrounded by a plate of raffles.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Howard. "This is our score.
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, possibly covered in aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a rough start
As Mexico's incoming president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is especially bad right now.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected blocking several key routes to the capital and causing road chaos.
But the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential jersey and take over the leadership of the nation.
They face a difficult task.
Mexico has done well economically under outgoing Felipe Calderón, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence", President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the American president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader vary even in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in a good way.
Citizens credit him with developing tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built, a huge improvement over the bumpy, potholed roads that used to be here.
His name is also on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change", says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state lawmaker for President Peña Nieto's party, the Institutional Revolution Party (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economic sphere that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vincent Fox.
Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations from Enriqua Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects the opposition's characterization of the new president as a man of no substance.
He's a very straightforward man, very biased with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman and most importantly, he's a good listener.
But on the other side of the state, that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Tucked under the highway overpasses, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help crack down on drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, with violence against women particularly acute.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been dumped in empty places next to a huge landfill.
During Pena Nieto's time as governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics say that during his time in office, Pena Nieto failed to adequately address the issue of female homicides.
And in the worst case, they blame the leadership for turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of a run-down neighborhood, Irine Buendia shows me a photograph of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her tears.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if someone had washed her body", recalls Mrs. Buendia.
He had signs of the blows and was already in post-mortem rigidity.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which has the only word on it: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me like I was some old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right with so many mistakes and omissions", he says.
The Sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his term in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was as governor", says PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of any ill-treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's claims of mistreatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's time in military custody in the town of Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the case based on Manning's treatment in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Army prosecutor Major Ashden Fein, cross-examining Private Manning at a preliminary hearing at Fort Maede, Maryland, contended that the records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing of the defense's motion to dismiss the case against Manning for ill-treatment in custody, which is a punishment in itself, took place the day after Manning testified that he contemplated suicide in custody.
An Army Intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while on duty in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Correctional Facility, where he was held in a high-security facility from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and took notes on his answers.
When asked about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning's officers directly asked how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems verbally and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they had not noted these problems.
"They wrote 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them", Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with the committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed in a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The military said it used this restraining order (one-stage suicide watch) for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regimen... so I could enjoy the increased quality of life I saw", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday that he was captured in Iraq and transported to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once fainted from heat.
He said that being kept in the dark about himself and the world around him was very distressing.
"My world has shrunk to just the base of Arifjan, the cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most of the day (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell with no company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, a set of tops, some clothing and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light outside the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned the other way in the night, they would wake him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in his deposition Thursday, that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover his blanket during the count.
In Friday's hearing, Judge Manning said that he had reasoned from the orders of his guards that he had a blanket to cover himself with, but admitted that no one had ordered him to put it down.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could have used a belt from his underwear or his earrings to injure himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his badge, and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that if he is convicted by a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense said they plan to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight the other charges because they're too extreme.
A hearing is scheduled to begin this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the detention terms as warranted.
The Pentagon issued a statement saying that Manning was being held in accordance with the regulations governing all arrested prisoners held in maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawfully causing intelligence documents to be posted online, transmitting information of national security concern, and theft of public property or records.
If he's found guilty on all charges, he could be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who leave; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely broke through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and all my life I've been called "Mexican".
It's an ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Italians".
So I ended up with the label "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of a conversation in that language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment this week when the newly elected Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House.
The agenda included the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are just as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to move to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, at gunpoint, to cede half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are ubiquitous.
So the minute after a U.S. representative says something even slightly critical about Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans are interfering in their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will step onto the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who the country offers opportunities to, and others who don't.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or a grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person matched the profile -- dark skin, poor education, poor village background, and so on.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream now, going to good schools and having good jobs, we can never forget the fact that we're living the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may be fuzzy sometimes, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And yet we know that many of the Mexican elite, the ruling class, don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a humiliating reminder of defeat and they see us as a second-rate race that's not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is nothing but failure in their eyes.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't be caught behind the silk curtain, living the good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans don't like that.
Even though she's a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, a lot of Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they're part of either.
We love to listen to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico, they look at us like we're Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to complicate matters even more, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "temporary ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country and pressure our political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Well, you know.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still feel resentment for the way their family members were treated in the much more recent past.
I'm not going to.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such misfortune is futile.
Amid the usual pointless speculation about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and rockets from Gaza first landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even as Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the region's unfolding chaos.
It may cause their fight to be bloodier than ever before.
However, there is reason to believe that this could break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little cause for optimism at present.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds, this week's fighting has intensified the fallout on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim that they forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite killing several Hamas leaders and locking up the 1.7 million residents of Gaza in one of the most desolate and crowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another slice of Palestine that is currently ruled by its bitter rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the resurrected regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has now joined Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Hamas cheerleaders say the Islamic crescent is wrapped around Israel, north of Lebanon where Hezbollah is in power, through Syria where rebels who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism can topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
And above all, in the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be eliminated by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will reach the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in the box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its worth and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unflappable as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively peaceful from suicide bombers, in part thanks to the wall that encircles the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined forces with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the campaign for the January 22 elections, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be launching rockets like their compatriots in Gaza?
Better to keep them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their minds.
Even if the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries do not have much love for Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
That President Mursi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and could be the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of Palestinian self-determination is creating a powder keg that must one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is making the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza that are occurring every few years to suppress Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper are saying: two states, where Israel will cede territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that stopping the firing will give outside pressures at least a little more leverage in getting this thing done.
Egypt, which must work with Turkey and Qatar to stop the flow of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with a swap of land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside must also push for a Hamas-Fatah agreement.
That would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's pathetically shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the ugly cigarette pack laws have come into effect
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, display warnings for smokers and diseased body parts.
Australia's ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws, the first of their kind in the world, came into effect, and the logos and colors of the labels were replaced by common olive-green boxes with hideous pictures of diseased body parts and images of children and newborns who have become ill as a result of their parents' smoking.
Aside from the various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes from Saturday onwards is the brand names printed in the same small print.
It is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by making the habit less appealing.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by age 26, there's a 99 percent chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even very young children can be seen to understand the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell them with their product", says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that show, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that the law would increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"There are going to be serious unintended consequences of this legislation", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will import many more of these products to be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-run company, said that demand for the silicone cigarette wrap used to cover the unpleasant packages rose from almost zero sales two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal of the laws to the Australian Supreme Court.
Ha stated that Zico sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and was expecting new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible obstacle, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you're a marketing executive in the tobacco industry and you're left with this little space to promote your products, the online space is the ultimate place to be", says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted the increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is this just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and went to the trouble of making this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to deal with the new regulations rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries does significant business with Australia.
The Commission will take a decision on the SOW in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now they have spread to over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Images have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and put the box back in", says Victor El Hage, buying a box with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack store in Sydney's city center, says that the single boxes make it harder for him to line up his books.
"It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours", Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we'll close the shop,'" he said, and he put his hands together.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for your next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and child-development experts are increasingly coming forward with praise for boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to be bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And given that most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don't get the chance to enjoy the boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
- I know.
And not .
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that had come about with the advent of more leisure time.
But according to Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history", he said.
A Latin inscription on the walls of Pompeii, dating from the first century C.E., was found relating to boredom.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting to do something that would satisfy me, but not being able to".
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything but wants to be.
He says that in apathy there is no compulsion to do anything.
He says that the core of boredom is "a disruption of the attention process associated with a bad mood and a sense of time passing slowly".
Nostalgia can be very depressing.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have an interpersonal relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, whereas people who are depressed see the problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in a nearby room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while a third group did not hear it at all.
Those who listened to the TV program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they weren't sure why, and they attributed their trouble to boredom.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or compelling task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, if you are doing something boring, "such as finding faulty parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you not to get bored".
In fact, he said, we now know that squatting and yawning, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to move around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", said Professor Fenske.
We've all had boredom at times -- my flight delayed, the speaker buzzing, the movie particularly long.
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980's.
The scale includes questions such as "Many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all".
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally uncaring.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and while doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said that they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knows that "adolescence is the peak of boredom", which is largely because children and youths are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?"
Sometimes, research shows, it doesn't, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble, or abuse drugs as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nudity is the brain's way of telling you that you should do something else", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, you'll feel good about it.
But if you watch TV, it will bring you pleasure for a short time, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he's not bored anymore, but he's not learning how to entertain himself or drive by himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this self-control is transferred from one situation to another", the professor said.
Your child is not just learning to entertain himself but is gaining greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her, either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable being out of reach of the constant drubbing of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood has agreed.
"We blame her for needing to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful", he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy leisure.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated", he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise is off".
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a vocational-education college student and football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing felony charges for what will soon be legal statewide - possession of several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day, he was driving with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After an officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was issued a citation for possession of narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia - misdemeanors for which each fine is $100 - and was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals", Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug cases depends more on the place than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offenses have already been dismissed here and in Washington state, which has passed similar measures.
The police department has stopped charging adults 21 and older with possession of small amounts, which will be legally permitted after the law comes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado counties have said they'll continue with existing marijuana cases, and still charge people for possession.
Meanwhile, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
"This is moving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Even the regulators in Washington state are raising their eyebrows.
And they're looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's a good guide", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than design what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can proceed", he said.
The Washington law, I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which also leaves a one-year vacuum during which there will still be no state licensing system, but legal possession will exist.
And there are tangled mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, such as how to balance a state's directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition on hemp trading within 330 yards of schools, parks, playgrounds or child care centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor will no longer prosecute offenses for possession of small amounts of marijuana by any citizen over the age of 21 and that the police will "with immediate effect" stop charging people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the city's laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In northern Colorado's Weld County, District Attorney Ken Buck is taking a more hard-line view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them face additional charges.
"Our office is obligated to prosecute criminal offenses that were crimes at the time they were committed", Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County where voters have rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer charge adults with possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all of the ongoing possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the conflicting reactions across the state to this great state green experiment revealed deep divisions among local officials.
For district attorneys, it's a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal", he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are well on their way to becoming national test cases for drug legalization.
The defense and state agencies are planning new limits on legalized sales while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to make the sale and cultivation of marijuana a federal crime.
Marijuana legalization advocates are hoping the Justice Department will bow down.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients who use it that garnered attention, the federal government has mostly kept medical marijuana shops in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states open.
While drug enforcement agents are unlikely to break down doors to seize a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana businesses to be allowed by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado towns are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new marijuana businesses, although it will be another year or so before any businesses can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the western part of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it's likely to go into effect next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we're issuing a license to somebody and then we have a big federal issue", said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our people voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a Conservative".
It's not just today's college students who are being attacked for their views.
I can't remember a time when I didn't dream of going to Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at what I thought was the world's greatest center of learning, a modern-day Greek-style symposium motivated by the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And yet, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of entering Worcester College, where I was going to study history, I packed my bags and plunged into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I quit because I objected to having sex with students in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson brazenly stated that I left because I was forced to drink from beaten-up cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm bringing this up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students on the center-right are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of conservative students called for the same equal rights protections as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Junior College (JCR) claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and made to feel unwelcome".
They are asking for a position on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they can express their views freely.
Their plight was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student politics, which conservatives portrayed as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver-headed cane.
At other colleges, conservative students say that they are being treated like "scapegoats" because of the higher tuition.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "leftist influence on the universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting us".
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant", while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in the JCR membership's attitude toward people on the centre-right.
"It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion as well as to the well-being of the members", he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a one-member minority.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and cripplingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most fervent.
A year earlier, the university voted to deny an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher over cuts to higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have made even Stalinists tremble with fear.
During the first few days of the first week, when the new students are interacting with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the soup that was coming.
I found that not only do professors tacitly approve of the picking of conservative students, they willingly participate in it.
The timber-framed offices were brought in by the policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture was on the translation of an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I was pretty tough.
Professor Pitt, the little man with the face of cake dough, was very gallish.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, if you're not too busy with social activities", Professor Pitt growled.
I went back to my room, crushed.
I was sitting alone at dinner at school when I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
It was a sophomore named James who identified himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a conservative is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen are pretending to be Labour.
Later, at a local tavern, I made a cowardly attempt to pretend.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick has proven unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who (ironically) went to Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are infected.
The other students took notes with it.
I was dirty, I was dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt like the gays must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
I'd have to turn into a Labour and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me have developed into a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speech-writers.
He was barely there.
He hated the place for its provincialism and pettyness and for its tendency to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began to commute from Oxford to my parents' London home, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dream moods.
Even my communist friends always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes turned grim.
Try it again.
I'm sure it was a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
A friend of mine, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week, in class, when another history professor declared with all seriousness that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was blushing with shame, I admitted that my "parents had brainwashed me" and called them "old fools".
The relief was only temporary.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for the Murdoch newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crept inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a grinning weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and toxicity in an educational institution.
But even more tragically, it was Oxford that not only produced 14 Conservative prime ministers, but that to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation as a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design" exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other celebrity clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition by Valentin Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which presents more than 130 models of high fashion created by his atelier over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle", he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but it could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which will be open until March 3rd, is filled with private correspondence and photographs signed by the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek princesses Marie-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian cream".
There's nothing wrong with liking royals.
"At least they don't put a cigarette butt on a great carpet, like some of the great pop-music celebrities do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains his guests with plenty and elegance.
"We were all very pleased to be invited to his Gstaad cottage", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star".
Valeria Mazza is playing Valentine
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentinian model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been many years since we went to dinner with him after a show in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decor, the food, the music, everything was turned on and his spirit was felt.
He made everyone feel important and loved", recalls the top model, who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art", he concludes.
The parade of nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of true love reversed.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been rebuilt into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passageway that offers a change of role: the visitor turns into a model and walks down the aisles to observe the "audience" of dreams worn by Valentine's masterpieces such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Night", or the wool and fur coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
Among the models' audience are Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurne and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that a first Valentine's Day is like a first love, "you can't forget it".
"I remember it perfectly.
It was pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection of 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he made for me", says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' muses.
"I prefer him to others because of his femininity and his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Ferri.
"I really like the colors he uses, they make the face look a lot brighter and more sparkly.
The proportions are perfect".
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget the first time she dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up in Italy, she longed to be an adult and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
She finally made it to the late '90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentin for the occasion of a wedding at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with a sash, a high-waisted skirt, and a top with no sleeves.
It was a dream come true", says Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless", explains an Italian aristocrat whose life alternates between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg has laid out the designer's wedding dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have inside".
The "King" of Fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her marriage to Pavel Grek in 1995.
To create this silk dress of ivory color with beads, twelve different types of necklaces, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long hem, it took four months of work and 25 "holek" (the designer's name for his sewing).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the foremost authority on the trade press, these dresses represent the high-fashion milestone of the late 20th century, "the return of the high society clientele".
Valentino, dazzled over the years by elitist savoir-être, is now the best example of it.
Knighted as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest decoration in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Legion of Honour, he accumulates as much honour as any of his client's husbands.
"I was always attracted by his elegance, his calm, orderly and perfect appearance", admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace on him".
If the princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: sulfur haulers in the Kawah Ijen area
For four euros, porters in the Indonesian volcano area risk their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people who think their work is hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, they must dig to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulphur gases escape from the Earth's interior and, on contact with the air, solidify.
After he has cut large blocks of sulfur, weighing up to 150 pounds [70 kg], he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It is only 800 feet [2,386 m] to the summit of the 8,500-foot [2,386 m] volcano, but it takes the exhausted porters more than 40 minutes to make the ascent at a torpedo-speed pace, as they maintain their balance and carefully balance their steps to avoid slipping and falling into the abyss.
They know that any slip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners at Kawah Ijen make five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
When they are up, they are being photographed by tourists, who are photographing them as if they were monkeys in a circus, tiring their heavy baskets to a scalar that the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 6,500 feet [1,800 m].
The company, PT Candi Ngrimbi, has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian Rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used to make lighters, firecrackers, cosmetics, dynamite, and even sugar bleaching.
"We usually carry 70 kilos, so we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
He takes three hours to drive one way and is destroyed at the end, but he can make 138,000 rupees ($1,750) a day.
While this may seem like a negligible amount for such an inhuman effort, it's three times what he would have earned on the field.
"The daily wage of miners here is very high, for example, for coffee harvesting, they pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and the 14-day wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", explains a porter who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.2 euros) a day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as compelling as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu and took her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, shortness of breath, persistent cough, and eyes irritated by toxic gas.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, where sulfur has already begun to take its toll, despite his face being protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, bad breath, a constant cough, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases leaking from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French", promises more than decent English.
This charming and intelligent young man, who could be a tour guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, is doing the job of a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up at two o'clock in the morning every day because the sulfur keeps boiling at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Through the surrounding darkness, Anto climbs into the crater and lights his way with a small lamp that he has attached to his helmet and that he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry on their shoulders baskets of sulfur from the crater floor
Although the company has a high income, it has not mechanized the sulfur extraction to save costs, nor does it provide any equipment to the self-employed carriers with such effort.
In fact, they do not even get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the photography surcharge, which, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) ticket, is collected by the park rangers from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, not for people", complains Madrusin, a 42-year-old butler who has worked in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
He can lift up to 110 kilograms and assures us that he will keep working "as long as he can", because he needs money to educate his three sons, aged between 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here, because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns their throats and stings their eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the thick fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so stubborn that no one complains of suffering from serious illnesses . . . but it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain, and shoulder injuries caused by the weight of the baskets.
At 53 years of age, the Unaik, who balances his basket on his back, can only carry 50 kilos.
Each day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is then transported by three trucks along a steep path through the bush to a warehouse in Tamansari, 11 miles [18 km] away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because I've been a volcano all my life", Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
The eldest of his five sons, aged 30, also earns his living by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the unending misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by the human mullahs of Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on career stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm a married patriot, you're my wife, and you're a patriot, so let's do our civic duty and start a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a commercial for menthol candy, but nevertheless - or perhaps because of this - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local allusions like "let's put the pot in the oven" to mock the birth rate in Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency that produced the video, hopes that this ad will help them to notice the problem in a humorous way.
The agency's artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to make people do "their civic duty".
"It's all about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing our population, so we felt that this was a topic that we needed to address.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things like promoting pheromone perfumes or having dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they weren't entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like rapping, to solve this problem".
1.2 children
The one that doesn't take it lightly is the Singapore government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leaders and strict social controls.
The fertility rate in Singapore, in terms of population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered the recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department of the National Population Bureau, says it is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the delay in marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decline in Singapore's birth rate.
While there were efforts within immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this provoked resentment among the local population.
Some Singaporean websites show an open xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence.
After the election, there was a push to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health care expenditures, and immigration policy, there have also been some unanticipated consequences in Singapore's case.
The government is trying to stop so many small houses being built.
It began to affect the real estate business, for example.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has begun regulating the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments are 46 square meters and have been a great success in terms of sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may encourage a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developer EL Developers, claims that their "boot boxes" are selling far faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, and they sell days or weeks faster than houses with more floor space.
So they're much better for our cash flow".
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously restricted from offering too many small houses in one project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could be aimed at increasing the nation's birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district suggests they won't have much of an effect.
"People are always stressed, houses are expensive, education is expensive, so many people put it off", says a young official.
"Let the others have children.
But for me, it's important to rely on my own money and time", says another, in his early 20s.
Men and women cite career stress and the cost of living and education as reasons for not having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is ultimately Singaporeans who have the final say in starting a family.
Offline privacy is private as well as online.
It's private.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any interference".
What's privacy to someone under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the danger he is exposing himself to by posting things on the Internet that he would almost certainly not tell anyone in a normal communication?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be 'something entirely personal' on a personal level and 'username and password' on a social network.
"My biggest secret is not to go public", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret, my mom might know about them, but not the whole world", he says.
"I put nice pictures on Facebook or pictures of us playing.
I also go there to talk to people I know.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that would embarrass someone", he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene, nude, or criminal photos or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 of his friends on Facebook and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends", he says.
Without hesitation, he says that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and on the latter network he admits that he doesn't know 20 people from his friends list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music", he says.
According to this boy, none of them asked him for anything, not even an address or a phone number.
"If they press me or demand it, I simply delete it from my account", she admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
These boys are no strangers to what we now call cyberbullying.
"Friendly social media user was blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was", he says.
The victim didn't log off from the account, according to Josh.
"She just activated her private mode".
Then it explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of people he knew in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if I didn't like someone or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate of the Department of Education and Training, believes that in order for children and adolescents to navigate social media correctly, they must understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform.
He states: "The Internet began as a means of information retrieval, but the advent of social networking changed the rules of the game".
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate student of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these terms to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the age of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are still learning ourselves", he says.
She explains that it is a difficult subject "because we ask them to distinguish between what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
Also, to be environmentally prudent, at a time when what they want most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences", she adds.
She says that the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to ask thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work", he adds.
Marrielos Porras goes on to list some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, "Would you like it if someone posted your picture like you posted a friend's?"
Do you know what other people are saying about you?
When you tag people in photos from the party, did you ask those people for permission?
And one more: does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to make them realize that they have to behave in an online environment just as they do off the Internet.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the internet, people are guided by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be true on social networks", he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first grade teacher, and educational consultant, explains that it is essential for parents to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If they understand the insidiousness of each, they have a good basis for discussing with their children the consequences of setting up an Internet account.
For example, on age or what is allowed to be shared or published", he says.
Guardia feels it's important to remind children of the traditional rule "don't talk to strangers".
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration is not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the issuing of the Lima Declaration, which was approved and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th UNASUR Heads of State and Government, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Office, who initially stated that the document would be published after the summit, said that it would be published later on the website of the Peruvian government.
They further stated that the content was made public by the Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Press access was restricted throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential meeting was broadcast in the press room without sound, with the message "confidential meeting, sound transmission prevented".
The limited information available to journalists was provided by spokesmen for some governments who were present, but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of the presidents attending, which provoked the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets, who demanded more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with the "concluding statement" from the summit, but this is only the statement of President Humala, and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the Americas of the South-Países Árabes (ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, despite being eagerly demanded by the press.
The official ASPA website states that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that all journalists had access to the news, but they completely blocked the flow of information.
The Summit ended, among other things, with Chile and Peru jointly committing to accept the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
President Ollanta Humala of Peru and President Sebastián Piñera of Chile met in a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will start hearing defense arguments from both sides on Monday to hear the dispute initiated by Lima v. Santiago.
"We will obey and execute the sentence that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court", said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts", Piñera added, greeting President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia this week adopted the Bogotá Pact, expressing its abiding by the international court's ruling on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which Colombia considered to be completely wrong.
The Summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the recall of then President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and closing the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, which informed that 16 agreements had been accepted and activity was planned for 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residency agreements are being extended".
He reported that actions are being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines and low-cost internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not be a winner, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our peoples a better future", Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections between the different places of South America, especially the rural and border areas..., so that our countries are better connected and create new economic links", the Peruvian president said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and its transverse axes from the coast to Brazil, and the other two are for better connections with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the Summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region, one that is integrated and has good neighbourly relations.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice ruling on the maritime border dispute contested by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow", Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country", he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and thoughtful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are meeting in Mexico on Saturday, where they are expected to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
The EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence matters.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe on integration
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which "South America, in this case, really must learn from Europe".
Correa, who was attending the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, Peru, said on state TV that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one nation".
In this sense, the project advocated the creation of a South American citizenship, which is supported by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place between the members of the Andean Community, but there are still regressive areas that want to return us to the past", he warned.
Among other things, the Ecuadorian president expressed his agreement to the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the trial in progress".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be questioned on Swedish territory for an alleged sex offence, and "Swedish law allows for the interrogation to be carried out by videoconference, which could be carried out from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health could deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, but nothing serious", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition is in danger of deteriorating, "because he is confined to a small space, "without the possibility of moving out into the open air.
It would affect everyone's health", he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks have been held with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We don't negotiate human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been conversations all along.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings before various European bodies", he said.
He said, "If the UK issues a release tomorrow, it's all over".
And if Sweden can interview Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as is readily permitted by its legislation and as has been done in other cases, this problem will be over tomorrow".
Correa took advantage of the situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, making it clear that he does not tolerate "understatement, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemies of a free press are not us, the vile and perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail", he said.
In this regard, he expressed his satisfaction that neither such journalists, "nor the bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie, rule Ecuador", and he said that if reelected, "he will continue to make changes in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay's membership in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupism wrapped in legality", because in fact "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also said that he considered "quite appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently admissible.
"This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be considered in their broad outlook in order to overcome them and to be able to move forward".
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile before the same court, expressing the opinion that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international instance if both countries commit to accept the verdict, however harsh it may be".
Regarding the possibility of running for a third term in the next presidential elections in Ecuador, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has stated that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
"I personally have never been interested in power, but situations as unjust as the socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility", he said.
"If I win, it will be my last term as president and then I will retire from politics.
If we lose, I'll be the same.
I've made my decision", he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chavez had gone for a scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the president's health", he explained.
The head of state of Ecuador today attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when his test came back positive for HIV.
"It was like being struck by lightning", she recalls, reflecting on a moment of truth that the doctor tried to "slightly soften" but apparently failed.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on himself and started to learn about it, and with such dedication, he celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is without doubt one of the longest-serving patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he joined in 1994 after several struggles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of uncertainty, few treatment options and greater stigma.
At the time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say good-bye to him, "because he had a cut".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, many people are unaware of their illness and come in only after the virus has wreaked havoc with the body and weakened the immune system, and they become casual victims of infections.
Thirty-one years after the AIDS epidemic, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great achievement that the life expectancy of a patient who is started on treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, with this information confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectious disease specialist and HIV/AIDS specialist, explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence but that survival and full life expectancy depend on the degree of immune system impairment of patients diagnosed with the disease, with those who do not take drugs better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live to 75 years without problems, if he continues to receive treatment", the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth noting that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Joint Programme of the United Nations on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far this year as of May.
Why do people keep dying from the effects of disease?
- "I don't think the problem is in the treatment options.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
We haven't run out of drugs in at least the last 12 years, and the problem is that patients come in at a very advanced stage because they don't know the disease, which is the late stage of the disease".
It adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come in with some co-infection, and the only thing we can do to make a difference in the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease early, and therefore to offer screening tests on a large scale to all those who request them".
His proposal is in agreement with experts and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in the state of Jalisco, as well as with patients like Fabrizio, who came to a private laboratory to get tested just because a friend had done it, and despite his young age, had already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous disease that is one of the common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know any more.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather do three times a week", they say, but that's not my case.
I've changed for the better, I'm healthy, I'm exercising, I'm on medication".
To this day, his parents only know that he had cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but I take care of myself and the other person responsibly", says Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO journal to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today on World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested, if they're at risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, that's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them know that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible".
This message sums up the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who researches HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that do this, "they've actually increased the condom distribution, they used to give us one or two, now they give us packages of 100 condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who don't have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are teenagers.
"What do you want for it?" is a common question filled with irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists, and health-care workers that adolescents want to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, not just behind the counter, but in the dispensers of public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It is not promoting promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying for beer and a motel", as Governor Emilio González responded to a question about whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
The best thing is to make condoms available to those who are already having sex", he said.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This condition ranks fourth in new and identified AIDS cases in Mexico and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that some 50,000 people may be living with HIV, since for every registered case, there are four to five people who are unaware of their disease.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debts of Grupo Vitro as established by the bankruptcy in Mexico, sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country and solvency problem.
It seems that the corporate restructuring procedures that Mexican law allows are not applicable in the Land of the Stars and Stripes, despite international agreements.
The approval of the ruling issued on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Halem in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves in practice a Mexican company defenseless against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the United States Supreme Court for the leading Mexican glass manufacturer to appeal against three of the irregularities.
For a start, while the judge in this case argues that creditors should follow the United States' insolvency law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings provide for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, it would show a lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law, which is arbitrated by the American Law Institute, was created for this purpose.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the voting of the branches from the internal corporate structure, whereby the indebtedness of the parent company Vitro towards the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is permitted by Mexican law.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose corporate debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Bankruptcy.
Moreover, it is true that even after the branches' votes had been counted, the creditors - who had been suing Vitro in the United States, i.e. the 'soup' funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have achieved a majority.
In the ballot, they would have got about 45 to 37 percent.
The Court of Appeal disregards that assertion.
On the other hand, the Court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, against the background of the severe economic crisis that hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm of Gonzáles Sada will appeal to the Court of Appeal for a new trial, so that the trial is conducted in full, that is, with the participation of five judges, since originally only three judges voted.
If he fails, he will seek a review of the process by a higher court, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
What is significant in this case is that the court omitted to mention a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae detailing Vitro's conduct under the Bankruptcy Act and pointing out that the company had taken it easy by relying on agreements signed by both countries to confront that Act with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
A blow to both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
The overall assessment
For months, the Mexican aviation union's criminal complaint against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who was charged with fraud, had been lying unnoticed on the table, and according to the pilots' union, the container had already been filled.
The agency, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing them of obstruction of justice.
According to it, the Control Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that businessman, in which he withdrew 198 million pesos from the IXE bank in the name of Mexican Airlines from the Fideicomiso F/589.
The funds were most likely used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Administration.
As is known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Martha
A group of local and international ecologists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens met at the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend to approve the creation of an association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon March in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a huge commercial and distribution center with products from the "land of the great wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees of 150 companies in the lower part.
The Canacintra (National Chamber of the Transformation Industry) had already succeeded in uniting the governors of the southeast zone to oppose the monumental complex, which would have partly devastated the protected areas and which is the origin of all resistance to the industry.
The end of the ACTA affair
The Senate's motion, which the government did not consider and which demanded an explanation of the terms and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), has lost its relevance.
This is despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, the developer Homex is putting up investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical series that offer interest payments every 28 days.
Competival is born
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet has created an association with the trade name Competival, which will target the software services market in Central and South America.
The business investment will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, a basketball world champion, has been involved in the indoor sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke in 2008 left him in a wheelchair, Reyes had been involved in the sport for more than 60 years, as a junior player, a player of the National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, and president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in my life in basketball, including several simultaneously, such as being president of the BSN national league in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and president of the federation", Reyes recalled when he visited reporters from Primera Hora newspaper at his home in Bayamon, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house, almost entirely decorated with photographs and memorabilia from his long career, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all the guards, those that commemorate his tenure at Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the team of Los Vaqueros since 1967, either as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I was out of the league for one year, 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
"Cuco" Ortiz took over the team, and he was a great leader", Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here and at the time was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, telling me, 'I have a grown-up player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brings Bayamonu a championship win, Gausse will then contribute to the next one.
Gausse enjoyed the championship, but only remotely, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At the time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and enjoy Mincy's place in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in an Olympic qualifier in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we would have had the bronze had it not been for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final throw", Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, like the one who beat the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was very similar to the way we won bronze at the World Championships.
That team not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramón Rivas, Fica López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had the youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The men's team that may not have been a perfect team, but that was able to win a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the 1995 Olympic qualifying team in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players who were eliminated due to a brawl at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold against all odds.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No Puerto Rican has ever achieved the level of success that Piculin has.
Not to mention his record in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work very much from a young age.
What is your greatest accomplishment in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you fail to prove?
There were things I wanted to do, like regional divisions of youth categories.
Like the Ponce boys playing in their own area and competing against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Kids travel a lot now and play too many games, which is unnecessary.
I also see the benefits of mandatory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What are you doing now?
Mostly I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos of music from my time, I enjoy my grandchildren, and I occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
The actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, is best known for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series Dallas, in which he played a man who acted recklessly and was vicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new series of Dallas, died Friday afternoon of complications related to cancer, according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by Dallas Warner Bros.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved most", his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who played his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death in a Dallas hospital", her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, gentle and talented, and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest", Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
A year before Dallas aired, Hagman made a name for himself on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted sitcom I Dream of Jeannie, which ran on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a genius) played by Barbara Eden and takes her to his home to live with him.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film appearances include the critically acclaimed The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that brought him to stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities surrounding them ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot Ja'far?" campaign, which was supposed to raise expectations about the thrilling story of the Hangman's character being nearly murdered, not only caused a huge amount of speculation from viewers around the world, but also risked millions of dollars at the box office.
That helped this episode set a new record for viewership.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the MASH series in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy glutton with a charismatic smile: a sly businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to have his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), an alcoholic, committed to a mental institution.
"I know what I want to have on J.R.'s headstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the one thing that didn't work.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers around the world and in the hearts of all of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new series of Dallas aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second series have been completed and the sixth is in production", the TV station reported.
Immediately following Hangman's death, there was no immediate comment from Warner or TNT on how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who had starred in such classics as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950's, Larry tried his luck on the New York theater scene, and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the celebrity-packed city of Malibu, California.
In 2001, he published an autobiographical book, Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm someone", he told the Prensa Asociada agency at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became involved in promoting organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to help fearful patients.
"I counsel them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they go in for surgery and afterward", he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of, "don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be fine".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
A course exploring "the end of the world" begins
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charme decided to teach a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long count" of the Mayan calendar, which is supposed to come on December 21, was seized upon by many as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what lay ahead in the next few months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget collapse that some have called "debt Armageddon", and a growing conflict that is dragging Israel into the place where Christian end-of-the-world theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charme told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you analyze what's going on in the world today, like if we had 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means good to the apocalyptic mind.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, an academic assistant named Barry Vacker is teaching a course on "Middle Ages, Culture, and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas spread over time", he says, "and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students are analyzing apocalyptic-themed movies and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, plausible and impossible", says Vacker.
On the main campus of Penn State, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, a graduate assistant in art history and anthropology, have teamed up to create a course simply called The End of the World.
"We don't connect '2012' because we always count on the possibility of re-arranging the course in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must study, do projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the evening of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched out to two hours", said Restall of his high-performing course, which had 35 students enrolled.
Weeks and weeks before the semester started, we got emails asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I never heard of a class where that could be taught", he said.
"I'm enjoying this".
But no student interviewed, let alone the professor, said he believed in the December 21 deadline.
"Our first project was about Mayan predictions, and we're kind of refuting it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar", Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back centuries, where people respond to changes in their environment with predictions of the end of the world.
The Internet has fueled this speculation.
"That's not what people think about", he said.
It's happening in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond to a question about a course there on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, hinting at an exception to the highest authority.
We have the Pope's mercy.
Restall noted that many doomsdays have been talked about over the years, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors alike.
A few said that they were planning to attend the "end of the world" celebration.
"I'll probably call some friends to have a laugh", explained 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
