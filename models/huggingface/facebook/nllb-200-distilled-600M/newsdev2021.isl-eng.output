Biden leads the speculative minds in three key states
With only 100 days left in the election, Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, is using the power of three major swing states.
CNN reports today that Biden is in Florida, Arizona and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is favored with 51% of the vote against 46% of the vote for president.
In Arizona, Biden is 49%45% in favor, and in Michigan, Biden is heading for a win-loss streak, leading by 12 points, 52%40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn to all these states, and actually more.
Trump is currently facing a coronavirus epidemic that his countrymen are increasingly accusing and saying most of the longstanding inquiries the government has made have been bad, or very bad, at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has been badly affected by the protests and riots that erupted in the wake of the George Floyd bombing.
Apparently, Trump and his administration have been wrong or wrong about those things.
To challenge Trump's crown, he is now under serious criticism for ordering federal law enforcement officers to break up protests in cities where city or government are Democrats.
It has created a huge fury among the city's residents and the anger is spreading to other Americans.
Pictures of federal police kicking protesters in unmarked cars have also not helped the U.S. case.
The Lincoln Project advertisement is very much looking at this, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very little vote.
In fact, Trump defeated many states with very few votes and won the election with a minority.
Michigan, for example, won by just 10,704 votes.
That's less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all the views that political analysts say are valid are showing the same results, Biden has made progress.
A new CNN poll in Arizona shows that Biden's shot has now been pulled from the survey's check boxes.
CNN and Quinnipiac University's Florida studies are saying the same thing.
Fox News, which is well on the right and has declared its support for Trump in 2016, has published reports on the same subject in its media.
The president's last hope, according to the questionnaire's findings, is that Trump could hope to reinstate surveillance in key positions within the swing states if the campaign focuses on the economy.
The US economy has suffered a severe blow following the Covid-19 pandemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic crisis to the coronavirus pandemic.
That is, a large majority of voters seem to blame Trump for his poor response to the coronavirus pandemic, but they trust him more to deal with the economic crisis that is raging in the state at the moment.
So far, Trump has been having a bad run in the election debate.
In the wake of the unrest that has raged almost continuously since the video was unintentionally shot, with four police officers beating up George Floyd, Trump tried to steer the debate over law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order became his signature.
It seems to have failed, as I said before.
As opinioners become more critical of Trump, more and more Republicans are likely to say no to Trump and express support for Biden, or someone else, who is Biden without specifically naming him.
They do this because of the convention in the United States to vote in multiple elections on the same ballot.
Thus, the voter can simply label the other party in the presidential constituency, and allow it to be applied as a vote for all other candidates of that party on the ballot box.
Thus, Republican candidates for reelection are tempted to separate from Trump's campaign and achieve independent results in the election.
The Dakar Boxing Olympics postponed to 2026
The Olympic boxing games were due to take place in Dakar next year but have now been postponed until 2026 due to the coronavirus pandemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal reached an agreement on the matter.
However, the celebration of the first Olympic Games in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested for the well in Nantes
A volunteer at the cathedral in Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
According to prosecutors, Le Monde said the suspect, a Rwandan refugee who served as a church overseer, admitted to setting the fire.
The man's lawyer told another media outlet that he was proud of his actions.
Among the things destroyed by the fire were a 17th-century organ and historic church windows.
The 39-year-old volunteer, who has not been named, was arrested shortly after the well on July 18, but was released.
He was then brought back for reporting yesterday and placed under house arrest as a result.
There's no way out of this
I am very welcome at the home of Baltasar and Christian Samper in Copenhagen.
The purpose of my visit is a new visual art exhibition by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireyu, which will open on August 1st in the Houdun on Little Kambi, Snake Valley.
This is the first time the two of them have shown up together.
I'm being led down to Baltasar's studio where a great painting blows up.
Large and childlike images of early kernings but also of flying creatures; eagles on one side, birds on the other.
From the study, it's out in the garden of the home.
"We had a horse here biting the grass", Baltasar tells me.
The horse works much better than a slaying machine on these hills and hills we have.
Mireya is with us, Christian and Baltasar, and she tells us how her work is related to the works here.
Introductions, combined with works of paper and sculpture.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, where I'm working with light and stuff, she says.
It's been a year since that idea came up.
There were certain works I was working on that I would have liked to show there, but they were stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When Dad started painting and I saw where he was going, I changed my mind", says Mireya, "but Baltasar's work has a strong emphasis on Icelandic folklore about women's rights and wives".
"When I saw my father painting these paintings with the boys, I felt that I was the one who was going to make jewelry associated with them", says Mireya, but she works with Inga Bjarnasyni's goldsmiths at the Sign store.
So I'm making a bet out of the jewelry.
Last year, Mireya attended an exhibition of 72 artists at the Academy of Perception in Snæfellsnes, including the Little Kambi Sound, and found the building fascinating.
"This is a new space, an old loading room that is being built", says Mireya, who spoke there to art critic Baldwin Sverrisdotter, who encouraged Mireya and Baltasar to put together an exhibition.
She wanted us both to show off, and we thought,
Why not?
This is a good idea.
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and attended the Barcelona Academy of Fine Arts before traveling the world to promote his art collection and study.
He came here to Iceland in 1961 and he loved his country and nation.
Shortly thereafter, he returned, met his wife, Christian, and has lived here continuously since 1963, a period of 57 years.
Baltasar is a prolific artist, having had dozens of solo and Christian exhibitions.
He is best known for his large murals, including the frescoes in the Flatiron Church and the frescoes in the Cathedral of the Assumption.
"What affects what I do is the bitterness of Iceland and no other place", says Baltasar.
This low sun and these shadows that fade and fade.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, you can work here".
Mireya is the oldest of Christian and Baltasar's children, born in 1964.
"One thing I knew, it was clear, that I wasn't going to be a model", she says, "and she asked if she wanted to follow in her parents' footsteps".
So I went to high school in math and physics and did everything I could to get out of it.
Then I realized I was on the run.
"You'll have to give up", says Mireya, laughing.
Like her father, she has shown extensively around the world.
Much of Japan, for example.
All the children of Baltasar and Christian have gone the artistic route.
"I call it a virus", says Mireya.
There was no way out of this.
Numerous Icelanders have been in a grey area when the air traffic was lifted
The Minister of Social Affairs believes that Icelanders were in a grey area when the airline cancelled all flights in the middle of the night.
He then said that laws for firefighters to enter residential buildings would be considered after the well on the Brotherhood's street.
On 17 July, Icelandair recommended that all 38 aircraft employed by the airline be terminated while the airline's nuclear fuel was still on board the state-owned aircraft.
The Icelandic authorities were in agreement with the Commission's proposal to extend the period of validity of the agreement.
Nevertheless, the Icelandic people never stopped flying and sleeping in sunny beds after their resignation.
However, Minister of Social Affairs, Assmund Einar Daðason, says that he believes that Icelanders' decision was in the green and that it was a step towards the right of the wage earners.
I think this is a certain right that should protect wage earners.
When you're in conversation, when you're inside the mediator's office, that's not the way to go.
It's perfectly clear to me that this would not have happened.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that people were entering a gray area there what this touched", says Asmund.
He will not speak out because other companies are going the same way as Icelanders.
There is also now a dangerous debate that it is only natural to go ahead and build up this system to reduce this right and therefore I am completely against it.
On the morning of the blast, Mr. Asmund was also asked about the government's response to the well at the end of June, when three people were killed.
The Minister says the investigation is now on the board of the Housing and Human Resources Agency, to which he has made his recommendation.
 Under current law, firefighters are not allowed inside residential buildings.
I've asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development to look specifically at whether there is any reason to make any changes to the law.
I am ready to make the necessary legislative changes to reduce the likelihood of this happening again", says Asmund Einar.
The full interview with Asmund can be heard in the player below.
The US has said increased pressure on Nord Stream 2 contractor
The US government has made further attempts to force European companies to discharge the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, according to Welt am Sonntag, which witnesses conversations with people familiar with the matter.
According to the newspaper, officials from the U.S. Department of State, Treasury and Department of Energy have contacted European contractors to ensure they are aware of the implications of continuing the project.
A total of 12 officials must have had at least two online meetings with company representatives in the last few days.
Witnesses of the talks said the Americans had in a strange tone emphasized that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
"I consider this a very, very serious threat", one of the three told the German media.
These threats are in line with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's remarks last week, warning that companies involved in the project would be better off "acting now" or risking sanctions under Section 232 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy company Gazprom, which oversees the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In an interview with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the latter company said that the US' attempts to dig up a "significant infrastructure project" were a clear invasion of the European continent.
Earlier this week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved an amendment to the Defense of Marriage Act designed to expand U.S. sanctions against companies involved in the construction of Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
According to one carrier of the legal framework, the settlement may be directed to companies that pay for or provide ships, insurance, port facilities or connectivity services for such ships, as well as those offering a certificate for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the US' attempts to disrupt European energy by imposing sanctions on Nord Stream 2, and some have even called for Brussels to work on utilities.
Moscow's advisers have also strongly criticized Washington's move, calling it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would come up with a new plan for how the project would be completed if Washington officials kept the new sanctions under stress.
Undergoing further transfers of public bodies to the country
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs plans to move more public institutions out of the country in the near future.
The Department of Housing and Human Resources will be relocated north of the Saudi Arabian Peninsula in the autumn following a decision by the Minister, but experts within the Department have previously stated that they do not plan to move to the north.
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said in Bragisandi on the Balsag this morning that it was important for rural areas to have public institutions moved there.
This is followed by a great deal of value that also creates diversity.
It's nationally important, we're trying to build everything around here around the country.
Employment creation, monetary creation, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some kind of natural exploitation and this type of work as public jobs, are very good supporters of that development,' says Asmundar.
Creates greater diversity, creates better conditions under this resource depletion and currency creation of the nation.
Asmund's decision to move the fire protection arm of the Housing and Human Resources Agency has been fiercely criticized by its staff and the National Association of Fire and Emergency Carriers.
Six well-trained men who work in the department all live in the capital area, and none of them plan to move their cattle to South Africa.
I think it's quite clear that if there's a political exchange of views, how hard it should be to do this.
My view is, and has always been, that we should take radical action to better distribute public works,' says Asmundar.
We see that our neighbours, the Nordic and the Danish, have been doing this successfully.
He is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
I think more policy decisions need to be made about moving public jobs overseas, just like I was doing with the Housing and Human Services Agency.
He takes the example of the relocation of the Food Centre in Selfoss, Landmælinge Iceland to Akraness and Unemployment Protection on Skagaströnd.
 There is a workplace on Skagastrande today that is very important to that community.
I think we should take a step further into this creature.
I'm preparing a further step into this creature.
Faster shipping.
In his 50s, he was arrested in Seattle.
Systemic racism and the US president's decision to send federal agents to cities to quell the riots were widely condemned yesterday.
Fifty protesters were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police used explosives and pipe bombs in a mass protest yesterday that the police described as a non-violent one.
21 police officers were injured and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months have passed since the start of the protests against systemic racism in the United States after a police officer beat up George Floyd.
The blaze was used to demonstrate solidarity with protesters in Portland.
There has been a sharp clash between police and protesters since the president of the United States sent federal agents to the area, who have driven unmarked vehicles in disgrace to the authorities.
Thousands gathered in Portland over the weekend, using police targas and rubber balls as they clashed with protesters.
A 47-year-old child of miracles
U.S. reality star Kenya Moore is making a good start by empowering people who need to keep up with technology.
Moore, who is best known for her appearance on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, gave birth to her first child at age 47 after a technicality, calling her daughter the miracle child.
"It's been almost my whole life after having a baby", Moore said in an interview with People.
"So I know the anguish that people, especially women, feel, thinking that I might not have a baby".
Moore realized she was running out of time when she became pregnant.
I didn't want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
"I was waiting and after I got pregnant, I looked up and thought goodbye", said Moore, who did not meet her grandfather until she was 46.
A year later, they had a daughter.
The reality star says her daughter is a child prodigy in more ways than one.
In addition to being the oldest of the most primates, Moore's daughter was born a month and a half before the day was set.
Moore went to the imperial court, which proved difficult and took much longer than the traditional imperial court.
"I call it the miracle baby because it was a baby that everyone said was almost unlikely to have", Moore said in the interview.
Feds arrested in Mizoram with the equivalent of 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The heroin's domestic value was about 15.5 million rupees, and it was smuggled from Myanmar, police said.
A man and his son were arrested with a 1.9-pound heroin in Hnahthial province, Mizoram, near the Myanmar border, police said Sunday.
The heroin was sold at a domestic price of about 15.5 million rupees and was smuggled out of Myanmar, police said.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with drugs on Friday night in Ngharchhip village, police said.
They also lost about 280 grams of heroin, equivalent to about 1.5 million rupees, when they crossed the border, on their escape from the police, officials said.
According to police reports, this is believed to be one of the largest amounts of heroin ever used in the state.
The defendants were charged under the relevant provisions of the Narcotics and Psychedelic Substances Act 1985.
Even though the border between the states and Myanmar is closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, no deaths have been reported from drug smuggling or other precautions, police said.
Assam Rifles recently seized 25 trucks loaded with bethel nets smuggled from Myanmar, worth some 40 million rupees.
Doctors run 35 kilometers with makeup
British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 miles [35 km] in a face mask to show that oxygen levels did not decrease when wearing a face mask.
Lawton is a physician at Bradford Royal Hospital, where he has worked during the Great Depression.
To reject the oxygen-depleting theory and encourage people to wear a mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back with a mask.
Before launching, he founded a GoFundMe collection for The Trusell Trust, which caters to food providers in Bradford and across the UK.
I'm a big supporter of anything that keeps us safe.
"I've been struck by the misinformation that people have received about facial masks reducing people's oxygen levels", Lawton said.
Lawton said that he had competed in the triple jump before, but that during the Great Depression his endurance had diminished.
Last Monday, he ran the 35 kilometers.
"I never took off my makeup (no food or drink) and my oxygen levels plummeted 98% every time I looked", Lawton tweeted at the end of the race.
Prince Joakim still in the hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now in a stable condition at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France.
The prince underwent a brain operation yesterday after being diagnosed with a blood loss.
Prince Jehoiakim's condition is still stable.
The prince was blessed to have his hands on the professionals in time and is well-pleased with the events.
It is too early to say how long he will be in the hospital at this time", says Lene Balleby, Danish Information Officer at the Royal Danish Hall of Fame, in a written reply to the Danish state broadcaster.
Just a few days have passed since the royal family celebrated the 18th birthday of Prince Felix, the youngest son of King Joachim.
The wedding was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, the Château de Cayx in Cahors, southern France.
The family was still there on vacation when Joakim was admitted to the hospital yesterday.
Joakim, 51, moved to France last year, where he attends the Ecolé Militaire Military School, the first of Dana.
He then works as a defense linguist at the Danish embassy in Paris.
The French Crown Prince is a strong end to his father, the Prince Henry, a Frenchman and his wife, Princess Mary, as well.
Sells the apartment she's lived in for 30 years
Actress Susan Sarandon has put her home in New York City, USA, up for sale.
Saradon has lived in the apartment for the past 30 years and raised all her children there.
The house where she lives, Sarandon, was built before World War I and is in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.
The property is valued at a modest $7.9 million, or about one billion kroner.
The apartment is 560 square meters and is located on the 7th and 8th floors of the house.
Sarandon originally bought the house in 1991 with her ex-husband, Tim Robbins.
When they divorced in 2011, Sarandon took over the house.
Sarandon and Robbins had Jack and Miles together, but before that she had a daughter, Eve.
All three children grew up in the apartment.
It has six bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms.
The apartment is bright and beautiful and furnished with a very beautiful design.
Utah plane crash: Child and two adults killed in a backyard fire
Six people were on board a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed in the backyard of the city of West Jordan on Saturday afternoon, according to Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Three of the passengers were killed, including 43-year-old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his 9-month-old baby, and 36-year-old Milda Shibonis, according to West Jordan police.
The pilot's wife is in danger and a 2-year-old child has a serious bruise.
A 12-year-old girl was treated and released from a nearby hospital, West Jordan Police spokeswoman Jennifer Worthen told CNN on Sunday.
A 72-year-old woman who was in the house that was hit by the plane is in danger of death, the police department tweeted Sunday.
Three homes were also damaged in the blast, according to Tauni Barker, a West Jordan city spokesman.
The cause of the breach has not yet been determined.
The case is being investigated by the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board.
Gottlieb argues that the unpredictable spread of the coronavirus in the community makes it very difficult for schools to open in the fall
Washington  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warned Sunday that it would be "very difficult" for schools to open in the new academic year if the coronavirus spread seamlessly within these communities.
I think school authorities everywhere need to look at how the distribution is within the community.
If the virus spreads unchecked in the community, it will be very difficult to open up in that situation", Gottlieb told Face the Nation.
With fall due to begin in the coming weeks, the Trump administration had urged school authorities to open their schools to students and offer classes five days a week.
However, President Trump's and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's attempts come a week after Trump warned that the coronavirus pandemic would likely worsen before he recovered, and confirmed that school districts in the worst-case scenario could have to postpone school opening for a few weeks.
However, on Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance on how to safely open schools for students.
The guidelines call for ensuring distance between people in schools, advising students and staff to use facial protection and dividing students into targeted groups to reduce infection.
But the Centers for Disease Control did not issue a rule for school administrators to close schools if the coronavirus outbreak spreads, which Gottlieb says has been "unfortunate".
"With this uncertainty and no specific guidance on how to open schools, I think more parents will be careful", he says.
This is why I think it's very important to get accurate information about which metrics are accurate, which the CDC didn't include in their guidelines.
Gottlieb said school districts should consider the proportion of positive infections in the community, local prevalence and test rates when deciding whether to keep schools open or switch rates for online instruction.
If between 5 and 10% of the sections give a positive result, the problem becomes more problematic, but above 10% the problem is whether to close school districts.
"This is a sign that the epidemic has taken hold in the community", Gottlieb said, adding that this would make parts of Florida, which is in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, difficult to open for school classes next month.
Coronavirus outbreaks have spread to more than 30 states and the District of Columbia, but the peak of the epidemic is in the so-called solar belt off the southern coast of the United States.
Gottlieb said, however, that there were signs that cases were starting to slow in some states, including Arizona and Texas.
But even though Gottlieb had said there were clear signs that the rate of warming was slowing in some states in the solar belt, coal has been warming in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana, and Illinois.
Many governments have imposed a policy requiring people to wear masks in public places and have stopped targeted re-entry to track the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said that governments should consider closing down children, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other places offering indoor entertainment, and setting up rules on makeup to overcome the pandemic, which are measures that will allow governments to avoid re-imposing the strict restrictions imposed at the beginning of the pandemic in March.
In addition to making makeup mandatory, various governments and companies have mandated people to wear face masks.
McDonald's, the retail giant, is the latest company to make face protections mandatory, adding to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and others that have set their own rules on wearing makeup.
Gottlieb said he expected more companies to take up the mask, especially since the risk is considered high.
"If we can really control the epidemic when winter comes to a park until we get a pill or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, then we can do it with a mask, it's relatively simple, something we can all do that doesn't directly change our lives and allows us to keep what's really important to us, like keeping some businesses open and bringing our kids back to school", he says.
Although Donald Trump last week did not say he wanted to make masks mandatory nationwide, he last week urged Americans to use face-to-face protections, telling a White House press conference that they would have an impact.
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson:
Crystal Palace fans were given a ticket for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the club's chief executive, announced the attack by the manager Wilf Zaha's desire to leave the club.
The club has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now appears to be on the rise, but it has previously been linked to Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Now that he's 27, it's time to find out if teams in that class are still willing to pay higher sums for him, especially during the financial uncertainties of the sport this summer, after a season where Zaha scored four goals and made five appearances for Palace, which caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the final game of the season, Hodgson said that "the timing was expected" regarding Zaha's possible departure after confirming that the attacker had "clearly indicated" that he saw his future elsewhere than at the club.
There are three years left on the attacker's contract with Palace, and last year the club announced that £100 million would be needed to get him fired.
Hodgson's team finished the season with seven straight losses and a tie on the final day of the season, which led to the team's drop to 14th place.
Zaha only found the net once from mid-December to the end of the season with a long shot in the loss to Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for a sale last summer he tried to get rid of the company but no offer fought to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha replaced the agent in January, which seems to increase the chances of getting out of the company, and in the coming weeks it will no doubt be his job to secure a transfer.
Zaha is the most minutes played in the Premier League for Palace this season and was the only player on the team under 28 to play 1100 minutes or more, which shows how much reconstruction of the team could be necessary to undertake with the funds available to the player.
The coronavirus-prone state of Texas faces a major threat of tsunami in the Pacific Ocean
Weather forecasters have forecast "humid flooding" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna hit twice, bringing heavy rainfall and winds of up to 40 feet per second.
When it reached shore on Saturday, it was classified as a first-level storm (the lowest of the five-levels) and has now been downgraded to a tropical storm, but rainfall could still be as low as 150-300 mm on Sunday and winds could reach as high as 26 m/s.
Some areas have already received up to 230 mm of rainfall, including Cameron County on the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first tropical storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be safe at prices: "This is not nearly over yet. We still expect a tidal wave".
In the past few weeks, Texas has seen a huge increase in coronavirus infections.
Governor Greg Abbott issued a hammer bill for 23 counties that will be affected by the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston and Brazoria.
All the fights are a huge challenge.
This challenge is more complex and even more challenging as the fallout passes through an area that has been hit hardest outside due to COVID-19, Greg said.
The first landing was at 5 p.m. on Saturday, about 15 miles (24 km) north of Port Mansfield, about 100 miles (210 km) south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far away, in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in southern Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville, were without power Saturday night.
The Corpus Christi Emergency Department has set up parks near intersections to allow access if flooding crosses streets.
US President Donald Trump said in a tweet that the administration was monitoring the engine and the Douglas missile, which was heading for Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast of Corpus Christi, said that the approaching storm had added to her anxiety about the global catastrophe.
This 67-year-old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems related to chronic lung disease.
She said, "It's almost like a double shell for us.
I think a lot of people have become weak.
We're gonna get through this.
They're all good and strong and stick together.
Heatwaves on a Sailing Float in the South
The southern harvest has been unusually successful in the summer, and the weather has been favorable to farmers.
Most are finished with the first stroke, the second stroke is wide-open, and then some are expected to reach the third stroke by the end of the summer.
The weather has played with Sunni farmers and other people in the country this summer and has not wasted the time on the farmers' tones.
So the harvest has been successful.
Victor Augustson, a cowboy in Birtingaholti in Hrunamannahreppi and a clerk in a logging house is happy and content.
Well, it's just been going really well, I think the farmers just sounded pretty rough, it's been going really well, it's been a really good weather the last six months.
The sharks are very good at the end of the harvest and the quality of the sharks is good overall, says Victor.
The winner says that the growth is taking place, not least among cowboys, in flat-beds or outdoor areas, which has been very successful, but it is by far the most done in the roller coaster.
It's vivid, yeah, yeah, it's actually been really comfortable for the last six months or three weeks, it's been so dry and good, and then it's so comfortable to deal with this.
It matters, it's less stressful and you can save for tomorrow sometimes what you could do today, so it's brilliantly comfortable.
But you think some farmer will hit three times?
Yeah, I could totally believe it, the first ones.
We started on June 17th, it could be that the first ones had to take three things.
Early Rescue for Wolves - How to Prevent Injury
The Englishman Adama Traoré, who plays for Wolves in the Premier League, is a very fast player.
His enemies have been able to seize him to ensure that he does not get past them.
This has resulted in several dislocated shoulders, but now the wolves have come up with a solution.
The Sun is reporting this.
In the Wolves game against Crystal Palace, they saw a patient smear something on Traore's shoulders.
"This is something we had to do to protect Traore", says a source inside Wolves, but what was being carried on him was child oil.
 Making him a traitor makes it harder for the defenders to grab him and so we can prevent further injury.
His brother Traoré first dropped out of the team when Wolves played Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has been knocked out four times, most recently against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News by Prince Harry: A friend of the Duke of Sussex objects to the confirmations of a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott told Sky News that the content of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was no different from the gossip stories, the only difference being that the book was in-depth.
The former soldier wants to see more of the positive things that the couple have done, such as their charitable work.
Stott said: "I find what is written there to be nothing different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in the inner book".
There is a historian who tells us, but it is not proven that this came from them.
"I feel this is just another attack on them, just like the gossip that haunts them".
"I realize that they are in the spotlight and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish it was more about all the good they have done and their charity work than their personal concerns".
Of course, they never get away with it because of their position.
The support of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex overshadowed other members of the royal family, according to an expert in royal history.
Dr Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family would not have been able to use the star-studded Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to their advantage.
She added that the system of power within the royal family was fixed, but that public interest could not be controlled.
She also said: "The fact is that everything they did to support the queen tended to blame other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem".
They're incredibly popular.
They had fewer marriages than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a giant wedding, Anne had a giant wedding, too.
But although Harry and Meghan's wedding was smaller in some ways than William and Catherine's, the news coverage was equally large, due to the worldwide interest in the couple.
Donald Trump admits he often sees his anger on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often sees his tweets that drive unrest.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the US president said his unlikely tweets  which each contained white supremacist content  would get him into the biggest trouble.
When reporter Dave Portnoy asked him if he saw his posts, Trump replied, "Often, too often.
It was like that in the old days, before this happened, you wrote a letter saying that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and you said, "Oh, I'm so glad I didn't send this, right?"
But we don't do that with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you're gonna get a call   Did you really say this?
I say, "What's the matter?" and you get a lot.
Last month, Trump caused outrage after he re-posted a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida calling an elderly couple White power! or white elected.
And in 2017, Trump re-published three anti-Muslim posts, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the right-wing Britain First party.
The president told Portnoy that the renovations that would have put him in the most trouble
Trump said, "You see something that looks good and you don't research it, you know, and you don't know exactly what's on the helmet, which is small and you don't expand it, sometimes I've found that it's almost always the refurbishments that get you in trouble".
The president often shares his pride, his frustration with his opponents and his conspiracy scores with 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him get through the so-called "fake news" in TV shows and newspapers, which he says is a speculation of falsehoods.
But the president's own lies have often been undermined, and now Twitter is labeling Trump's posts misleading.
GPS systems may be unsafe
Many countries are developing a different technology than GPS.
According to a technician, the reason may have been to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. military.
The old Loran system has been renewed for life.
GPS tracks us at every turn.
We use it when flying, sailing, driving, land surveying, in industry, and in recreation.
Others point to the fact that it is a military device owned by the United States Army, which first opened it to the public in the 1890's.
GPS uses a satellite dish 20,000 miles [20,000 km] above the earth, and therefore, it is not affected by natural conditions.
But it's very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily disrupt the reception of these signals,' says Simon E. Þorsteinsson, a professor of engineering at the University of Iceland and an expert in risk management and telecommunications security.
He also says that it is easy to send false signals from the wrong location, such as in military situations.
The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense.
They have assured the public that the system is up all the time.
But they can certainly put it out if it went into the mind of the president's very expert mind to make him do this, then he could probably do it", says Simon.
Many countries have therefore begun to consider other systems and location technologies.
Both Russia and China are operating their own satellite systems, and the European Union is crushing Galileo's location system.
The Galileo system is primarily built for civilian use.
It may be more precise and is, of course, under the control of the European Union.
"It is not one government that governs it completely, but many", says Simon.
But many have also started to look back at the old lorry technology.
It's based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until GPS took over.
The Loran signals are transmitted at very long wavelengths from the lower reaches of the Earth.
"There is a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system, because it makes it a little more difficult for other laws to interfere with it, much more difficult than interfere with a satellite system", says Simon.
But it's probably safer to have access to most location systems.
The real employee of Congressman Vern Buchanan died of the coronavirus
"Gary was a professional fingerprint maker and a decent public servant", Buchanan wrote on Facebook.
He touched so many lives and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget his life experience, his sense of humor, and the joy of helping others.
Buchan's office issued a tenth-page statement earlier this month stating that Tibbetts had not had any recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had been with Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the start of the global pandemic, more than the 411,200 cases in New York, according to state health officials.
State health officials' data show that hospital admissions have increased 79 percent since the U.S. National Day of July 4.
The evidence also shows that at least 50 Florida farming districts reached their limits on Saturday.
'We let you know because this could have an impact,' DeSantis said in June.
MYTHING with the police and the law enforcement of this could have a profound effect.
Flight from the Horned Plain to Cape Town
The turkey, the rosy-tailed deer, the round-tailed deer, the vix, the glittering brown-tailed deer, and the weeping willow are among the birds that have made their way to the island in the summer.
The website of the South Eastern Bird Observatory provides daily brief information on the birds, their whereabouts and sometimes their species.
They are many of Iceland's birdwatchers.
To illustrate, the number of people who like the Icelandic bird species Facebook page is high.
The group has about 14,600 members.
It shares pictures of birds, and Iceland is obviously rich in good photographers who have the patience to photograph birds.
The Brunette Wolf is one of them.
Binni, as he is known, is an employee of the Southeastern Bird Conservation Center and the Southeastern Natural Resources Department, and closely monitors the bird life of the area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich Iceland's biology and play an important role in it, whether it is a large bird or a small bird.
The Bird Watch Centre was established in 2005 on the birthday of Hálfdán Björnsson on the Orebsk Islands, with the aim of keeping the birds in the air and continuing the remarkable natural research he had undertaken since 1940.
"Half-dano was 13 years old when he started to get information about birds", says Brynjulf in an interview with The Guardian.
 We at the Bird Observatory are not doing exactly what Halfdan did but we are building on his data by counting and labeling birds.
Halfdan was a farmer and a polymath, born March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects, and birds.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost a year old.
His half-sister and siblings in the Quikers sparked interest in Icelandic nature.
One of those is Bear Hostage Arnarson, a resident of the Bird Conservation Center.
Raised in the Plains of Reini in the Southwest, Bear was given a rich natural heritage by his neighbor, the Quicksand Peninsula.
But what exactly is the Southeast Asian Bird Observatory doing?
Every March, the Bird Watch Center sets up a special bird network in Einarslundi, a remote area just outside the Harbour in Hornafjord.
The birds that come into the net are marked according to a standard.
The network is down around May 10th, when the time of the fire starts.
The Internet is on every day, at least from about 6 a.m. until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds that enter are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter asks in amazement.
Yeah, we'll share this with each other, me and Bjöss.
"We have to work for ourselves now, so this may be a big puzzle, but somehow we can do it", says Brynjullf.
The network is then re-established for the period 1 August to 10 November  on all days, weather permitting.
Between watching the net and when they are not up, the werewolf and the bear mark crab, sponge, and various birds as they reach them.
They also carry out special tasks.
One such project, in cooperation with the Iceland Institute of Nature, is to collect forest meters of birds.
The forest mitter stings the birds at their wintering stations and brings them home in the spring.
This happens just before they leave, and that's why these targets are not big when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another shelter when he needs it.
But enough about miles.
When asked how the birds in Southeast Asia have been this summer, Brown Wolf says that the crocodile's warp seems to be doing well, since it overlies the head of a worm.
The crocodile's head here is at the South Pole, and everything is going well.
But there is no more warp in the Christmas tree, where a few years ago there was a huge amount of warp.
He says that a few years ago, over a thousand crickets were born there, but now they can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
When we look at moose and waterfowl, I feel that in recent years, what we see in them has decreased.
But of course, there's always a change between years.
What explains such a big change is that, according to Brynjolf, the food supply is likely to be the most important factor.
It's all about food.
Then human works can also have a say in the origin of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to be doing pretty well in Southeast Asia this summer.
"One thing I think is positive is that the cattle are growing again after a big fall", says Brynjuulf, "while the cattle have grown tremendously in the past few years and decades".
From the spotlight, it seems that the mary earl is planning to do well in his field this summer as last year.
The forest and the forest were declining slightly, but Brynjulf says it will not be revealed until the autumn how this summer has affected them.
But let's get back to the flip-flops.
They often attract a lot of attention, especially if they are very fibrous and even lumpy.
These two interesting events feature one of the most popular summer attractions: the Rose Garden.
"Annaras have been relatively calm in the summer", says Brynjulf, but notes that the village is now home to grey grass, and then round pigeons have been seen and are beginning to swarm here.
When the wolf and the bear are caught in the trap, they also mark them, just like other birds.
The brands are international and are exported worldwide.
The birds' wintering habitats, vertices, and routes are all available for various purposes.
"You can even see how long they've been on the air", says Brown Wolf.
This information is useful in many ways, including when it comes to measles infections on board a bird flu.
There's always been a growing knowledge.
If anyone else in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the Southeast Asian Bird Conservation Commission, the information is sent to the Iceland Institute of Nature Conservation.
We've been recovered from Cape Town, South Africa.
They found a crane we had marked.
One of our remains was later found in the United States.
One bird is the Brynjulion, especially the brain, and that is the spider.
"The cloud is our bird", he says, pointing out that the Bird Conservation Centre and the South East Nature Conservancy are monitoring its decline, which has become very destructive and is now in crisis.
It is difficult to explain what caused the collapse of the system, but one theory is that the sponge made a seafood that was previously taken from fishing boats and released into the sea, but that it is now being used much better and influencing the sponge.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
"You're not going to make me say no", says Brown Wolf, laughing, adding: "Since we're also chasing birds, we're going to have to go further".
But certainly the Southeast is unique when it comes to bird life.
This area is like a land drawn from Europe, but then the birds spread out.
It is very interesting to see birds and reptiles here, but there are fewer birds of prey than anywhere else in the country.
It is not far from the fjords and glaciers, so an area like this is well suited for bird watching.
But what about a brown wolf?
He thinks for a moment before he answers.
It's a difficult question.
'Twenty-two is my bird's end, I've found nine of the ten that have been found in the land,' he replies at last.
I find it most fun to take pictures of a horse's mouth now.
So it's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen here before or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe.
But that's what they've done, buddies Binnie and Bjoss.
If you want to follow the work of Binna and Bjössa at the Southeast Asian Bird Conservation Centre, you can follow their work on Facebook and the website Birds.is.
Saudi Arabia  The sunshine of the future?
Tourism has grown tremendously around the world in recent years, and now Saudi authorities want to get their hands on the cake.
The government plans to spend about 60,000 billion Icelandic kroner to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be the way Icelanders are used to in a sunny Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women will not be allowed to wear bikinis.
But how can tourists be attracted to this Islamic country?
For example, a new city will be built with white beaches, a moon (of course man-made), drones, and robots that serve people.
The Guardian reports that Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, wants to invest in this investment.
The money will, of course, be put into the country's oil reserves.
The crown prince says that it is not up to debate that women should be allowed to leave their shoulders and knees covered in public places, but admits that creating a tourist paradise in the country is not an easy task because it is too hot when the sun is high and winds are not reliable.
But you might wonder if it would also appeal to interested tourists if they could not afford alcohol.
Francois Bozize, formerly deposed as president of the Central African Republic, announces a presidential bid
Former Central African Republic president Francois Bozize, who was ousted from office, announced on Saturday that he would run for president in December despite United Nations sanctions and an arrest warrant for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his candidacy in a speech to a large crowd of supporters at his party's parliament, Kwa na Kwa (Friends, Only Work), in the capital Bangui.
This 73-year-old former military commander and general was seized by the authorities in 2013 in a rebellion by a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels from the north that plunged the majority Christian nation into a full-scale civil war and a severe and protracted humanitarian crisis.
'The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction,' Bozize said in a speech that was critical of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first came to power in a 2003 coup and served as president for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for crimes against humanity and inciting genocide, but he has not been arrested since returning from exile last year.
It is unclear how the arrest warrant or foreign sanctions affect his case.
In January, Bozize said he would ask the United Nations to lift sanctions imposed in 2014 for alleged support for the armed Christian group Anti-Balaka.
Touadera now runs the country with the support of a large UN peacekeeping force of more than 13,000 military and police personnel.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to run for a second term, but his candidacy has not been confirmed.
The first round of the election will be on December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups that are generally said to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violence has declined, and bloodshed, often caused by resource conflicts, continues to occur, but most of this diamond-rich country is not under government control.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale's position at Real Madrid is illegal for everyone, says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, Real Madrid midfielder, says Gareth Bale's position with the Spanish team is "unfair to everyone".
Bale didn't play in any of the team's last seven games and he played a small part in the La Liga celebration of Los Blancos, and now this summer has come the patty that the player is supposed to hold off and let his contract run out, but the club hopes to get him off the track.
'There is no way to avoid that the situation becomes unresponsive for everyone,' Kroos told Lauschangriff's Endlich was mit Sport.
He wasn't bought to play him as little as he is now.
I think he actually wanted to leave last summer and that the club actually said yes but then said no later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked if the situation had adversely affected the atmosphere at Real, Kroos said: "Not as bad as I thought I would be".
He's a great team, I've known him for six years, and we've done some important things together.
Chinese give Smoke City 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the coronavirus
Chinese Ambassador Jin Zhijian delivered 2,000 face masks to the mayor of Smoky Town last week.
The occasion was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese Embassy on July 22.
The weekly news first came in.
The purpose of the mayor's visit was to pay a second visit to the Chinese ambassador to Reykjanes City, where he visited the city council and met with the mayor.
According to WikiReport, there were discussions on developing friendly cooperation between the City of Smoky and the City of Xianyang, but the city began cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is a key to this friendly campaign, but Xianyang City Council wanted to donate masks to support the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
According to the news release, the masks will be used in sensitive facilities and workstations in Smokey Town for both employees and other visitors arriving there.
The accompanying image shows the flags of Iceland and the People's Republic of China, the emphasis on the facial mask, which says "Everyone is behind, except for a brother".
Thomsen wants to leave KR - He's trying to cut his salary
Tobias Thomsen is planning to try to get home to Denmark from the Icelandic champions KR next month and says he will find interest from Danish 1st Division clubs.
Thomsen has played for Iceland since 2017 and became the Icelandic champion with both Val and KR.
However, this 27-year-old attacker says that he has missed Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jakobsdotter.
Denmark's contract with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that the Danish club will have to negotiate with KR for a purchase price to get it in August, before the start of the new season in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
Yeah, I know the Danish section starts again in late August.
Of course, that means I'd have to cancel my contract with the KR, but I've told them I miss Denmark, and they fully understand that", Thomsen told bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with coach Runar Kristinsson, who had shown the station full understanding, and Thomsen said he did not think the purchase price would be much of a problem.
I've also had conversations with two teams in the Premier League after the league was over and they knew where they were going to end up.
There has been some interest already regarding the upcoming season, so it may well be that I am going to Denmark before the Icelandic league ends", said Thomsen, adding that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark that could buy his contract with KR.
It's not entirely clear now, but there's been interest.
I also need to find the best option for me and my girlfriend, who's from Iceland and is coming with me.
This depends on a number of factors, Thomsen said, saying he was looking primarily at the port of Copenhagen.
Thomsen said the KR didn't have to worry about not getting all the training and games, even though he missed Denmark.
KR knows what it takes from me and that's that I do things 100 percent.
I can totally overlook that I miss Denmark when I'm training or in games,' said Thomsen, who clearly says he will lose his salary by leaving the Icelandic championship in the next Danish league.
I'll probably have to cut my salary just because of the coronavirus crisis that seems to have hit Danish companies a little bit more than Icelandic ones.
But I'm also a student, and the only solution might be for a company to get me a job.
Most of the League 1 clubs have a sponsorship deal.
I'm studying sports management through the players' association and I'm finishing my bachelor's degree", said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the starting line-up for two games in the Pepsi Max League this season, but made history in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year, scoring seven goals.
KR is tied for the top spot in the Pepsi Max division and is in a good game, but the team is facing KA at Akureyri today.
Taking on the coronavirus on board a bus, the driver lands in a hot rage over a face mask
The video shows passengers and drivers aboard an Arriva bus in Liverpool grappling with makeup.
The driver heard a woman explain that it was not his job to tell passengers to wear makeup.
The driver said: "It's not my job to tell everyone to wear makeup.
Witnesses reported this incident: "A man and an older woman began to recognize her and a lot of confusion broke out".
The driver had to step out of his seat and asked what was really going on, and he told one woman that she wasn't even wearing the mask properly.
"The woman then stepped out of the carriage and said she was going to report the incident".
Arriva's spokesman said: "The safety of our customers and employees is as important as ever.
Our customers are as usual obliged to wear masks when using public transport (exceptions apply).
Explains guidelines and labels for customers regarding this and all other distance rules on board in the street walls, on social media and on our website.
The public transportation bill has been in effect since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus worldwide.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often in roles
The actress is taking part in a new struggle to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment industry.
The event coincides with 30 years since the United States' Bill of Rights for People with Disabilities was signed into law on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of people seeing themselves and their lives reflected in a secondary way on screen.
"Nothing can replace personal experience and sound printing", she says.
 That's why it's so important to hire the right actors for the right role.
Spencer discussed the impact she had on seeing horny people on screen when she was a little girl watching the show "Good Times".
The series, which ran on CBS from 1974 to 1979, was completed by Norman Lear and paved the way for the first comedy series to feature two parents who were both of African descent.
The hunger strike pushed Yoho aside after an incident in the House of Representatives
WASHINGTON (AP)  Independent Christian organizations seeking to end hunger said on Saturday that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the organization's board, and that he had done so, following what they called the attack on Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Democratic congressman Ocasio-Cortez of New York accused Yoho, a Republican congressman from Florida, of using a low-key, male-friendly cocktail, he said, when they met on the steps of the Senate floor last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words that were quoted, but a witness testified that the words had been as she described them.
Bread for the World said in a statement that the organization's board met with Yoho on Friday and asked him to resign to reaffirm our commitment to stand with women and vulnerable people, domestically and internationally, leading us to a world of greater racial participation and greater justice.
According to the Bread for the World website, their "Christian voice" pressured Congress and governments to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
"As Bread for the World is an independent Christian organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty through reliable public policies, it maintains the respect, dignity, and concern that Jesus calls us to show when dealing with people in authority, wherever they may be in the political arena", states the statement.
"Our attitude reflects recent actions and the words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral standards imposed on our board members".
At the time of the news, Yoho's spokesman had not responded to an email offering to respond.
In an incredible speech in the House of Commons last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically recalled the incident, speaking out against what she called male racism, which "compatibles violence and violent speech against women".
More than a dozen of her colleagues accepted her statement that the incident was an example of overly aggressive male behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion about dating and that the victim had been hurt, isolated or attacked.
He said he was sorry for his "fast response".
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is in her first term as a senior member of parliament and has received both praise and criticism for her cleanliness.
Yoho, 65, is one of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives and will be in the White House at the end of his fourth term.
Wait till the 98th minute of the final by scoring the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingard had neither scored nor put up in the Premier League this season, until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final.
Lingard had not scored in the Premier League since his double against Cardiff in December 2018.
He joined Manchester United as a permanent player today as the team faced Leicester in the Champions League final.
With seven minutes to go, Lingard caught the ball from Leicester's goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and scored the eighth goal.
Jesse Lingard's long shot.
Real Madrid players exempt from the rules of the game
Zinedine Zidane and his Real Madrid students will be able to face England in their second European Championship game against Manchester City without having to go for two weeks of booking.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain will have to go on a two-week hunger strike to start the spread of the coronavirus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of the highest-level sports teams.
This was confirmed by the Ministry of Sports to Sky Sports.
The Department says that individuals who are exempt from the rules will only be in restricted areas, at closed doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, coaches, medical staff, and media workers.
The Madriders can therefore face Manchester City on August 7 without spending much time in England, but they are 2-1 down in the singles after losing to Santiago Bernabeu on February 26.
The winning team will advance to the eight-team final, which will be held in Portugal.
Extreme poverty and the nationwide imposition of trafficking in human beings
From reports of overcrowded hotels and campsites, to judge, at least until Sunday, it is clear that Icelanders have been able to travel domestically this summer.
Those who have landed have also been extremely fortunate with the weather and the weather service has been on the one case that summer has only been clean, say, gracefully, until now.
But now it's suffering from the biggest travel market of the year so far.
Although it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, events that have attracted large crowds in the regular year are now being cancelled.
Just mention a national holiday as an example.
The weather will of course play a big role, but now the climate is looking green all over the country, but especially in the south and southwest.
The weather agency predicts a cooling off from Thursday night until at least Saturday night.
For example, long-term marriages are not sacred truths here in the North Atlantic and can of course be adjusted.
In his forecast on his weather website, Bliku, the meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson says that a decline is expected in the commercial human market.
He says: "The cooling of the ceilings, with the associated cold, which too often also reaches the surface, causes clear air from the southwest to approach, only to be drained by wind and exhaust.
And of course, the clear air that flows north here.
One publishes a prediction card in support of his prediction, saying that a small wave from the Americas is heading east, bringing with it summer-hardy air.
As it approaches, it reaches the flowerbed in the form of a drop in air pressure and a considerable summer blight.
The Great Depression, the European Accounting Centers on the left of the map and the US GFS on the right are quite contemporary with this development.
The signs of the decline will soon spread across Spain late Thursday and early Friday with a severe A-side and rainfall throughout most of the country.
The mean temperature of 985 hPa is followed.
This is followed by a fairly warm weather in the North and East on Saturdays and even Sundays.
However, it could be a sign of sympathy.
A man was seriously injured is a car with cattle grabbed in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A car was hit by a car.
The 34-year-old driver was seriously injured in the accident, which occurred at about 1:50 p.m. today.
He was taken to Wexford Hospital, where he is in a critical condition.
Police tech is searching the scene and the bridge has been closed and the subway has been opened.
Several cattle were killed in the attack.
Police are urging all those who were on the road between 1:45 p.m. and 2 p.m. and anyone else who may have witnessed the incident to contact Wexford Police Station on 053 916 5200, the police confidential number 1800 666 111 or other police stations.
The most wanted actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I was shot in it like a love-shot", says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the lead actress of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so impressed with the actress that she went to the show's studios and waited for her for hours just to say hi.
When Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir, owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, watched the twentieth-century thriller Law and Order: Special Victims Unit like many Icelanders, she sang for the series' lead actress Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her encounters with the actress in the series "Tales of Love in the First Season".
When Birna was a teenager, at the age when many began to develop an extreme love interest, she did not experience it as her peers did, for she was struggling to prove her own teachings.
She seemed interested in boy bands and young magical heartbeats from movies, but she had no interest at all.
I was cutting pop albums and hanging pictures on the wall of the Backstreet Boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian.
She says that it is sometimes said that when people leave the closet, they go through a secondary chain of events.
We spend our teenage years blowing down these teenage hats, these shots and stuff.
I think that was one of the things that attracted me to her", Birna says of the actress.
And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm and I was just shot in her shoes.
It went off the rails of the actress when she was stationed in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Earl Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie there in town and got Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Godjónsson, to help with the bags.
We were working in a 30-person workshop and we were spending quality time with strangers.
It's a natural atmosphere when you spend so much time together each day, so it was all about nothing.
It is said that one day Birna is a big fan of Mariska.
One of the women on the cast says that her friend knows the actress because he was on the cast.
Birna could not stop thinking about the fact and regularly asked her new friend how her friend liked working with the actress and if Birna could get to see her.
'She tells me to stop it, she doesn't know if she can let it happen,' Birna says.
When the film is finally finished, the group is shaking, and Birna tries for the last time to convince her to try and arrange the meeting.
She had already had some glasses and said she'd just fix this.
A few days later, Birna texted her and asked if something was going on.
The woman doesn't answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up to a long-range message.
I look at the phone and scream.
When I woke up, I said, "I've got to go to the bathroom and I've got to get my hair done and go downtown".
The woman had written to Birna that her friends, actors, and Law and Order were staying at a hotel in Times Square.
I don't know when they start or when they stop, but that's the name of the hotel, "good luck", says the message, and Birna dresses up in a suitcase, asks the receptionist where the bags are going, and takes the elevator up to the 45th floor where the group has gathered.
Birna comes to her and waits for a woman on her team to come and ask this uninvited woman if she can help.
I said I was looking for Jason and asked my wife to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived.
When the friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna and asks how in the past she managed to get all the way to the finish line.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and begs to be allowed to meet Mariska.
Yeah, I don't know.
"Sit here", says the friend, and Birna is getting tired.
She has an extra on the show next to her and they start chatting.
"I say to him, 'I'm a fan, but you are?' says Birna.
I played this like it was the most natural thing in the world.
Time is running out and Birna is waiting.
The actors regularly show up when the show is over, they get a chat and Birna looks around looking for Mariska who is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is sorry to leave.
Birna begs him to get his hands on the other employee, but she doesn't seem to be going anywhere right away.
The surprised friend accepts and approaches another employee.
He brings in his other friend and says, "This is the woman from Iceland who definitely wants to meet Mariska".
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend arrives running to Birna.
He says, "Hurry up.
It's an unusual situation today, there's journalists with her so she won't stop.
She's going straight in the car with them so you'll have to take the bait and go down and find her wheelchair.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up.
So I look to the right and lose my face. Birna starts to walk down the street with the elevator to Times Square.
There she finds about forty wheelchairs, some marked and some not.
However, when she does not find Mariska's wheelchair, she becomes desperate.
I feel like I'm getting a little overwhelmed because I've been doing this for half a day, but I'm thinking, well, I tried.
It was fun.
Vondauf takes Birna back to the hotel where she looks in the window the magic wand looking at herself with the eyes of a teacher and it becomes clear that Birna failed her plan.
Birna settles down with fate and it starts to rain.
I'm going under a shield to protect myself from the rain.
So I look to the right and lose my face.
No one else but Mariska Hargitay was there in the panties she wore to the show and Birna knew the meeting, but Birna could barely move because of mental retardation.
I look at your body and your hands and I think now you have to move.
Now you must go towards her.
Birna does, and she's gonna kick her ass in the shoulder.
She's looking at me and I can barely say anything.
But I just say hello and say hello, Birna's going to cry.
I'm from Iceland and a big fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you".
The conversation didn't go much further because Mariska's car is in and it's floating on her.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, "I have to go, but it was so nice to meet you".
Birna says goodbye to the cult, looks at the car driving away, and then it breaks down.
I called Erling and Gunna and they thought this was gonna fail.
But I was crying from excitement and joy.
I say, "Yes, I met her. You should meet me now".
"We were drinking soda and teak", says Birna.
She's not looking at anything, although she admits she probably wouldn't repeat the game.
It's like once in a lifetime, spending that much time and energy making it happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman.
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Hrönn Björnsdotter in the series Stories of Love in Series 1.
The police didn't spread the virus
There is no reason to worry that the coronavirus could be carried by alcohol used by the police.
This is what the Metropolitan Police Department's traffic police officer told mbl.is.
There have been reports of people worrying that the same mouthpiece is being used for all drivers when police get in, hit a traffic jam and blow everyone in the way.
The police say the purest of cleanliness is possible.
"These are not really special mouthpieces, but we're using a cup that people blow in", says a police officer.
"Some people want to put a stop to this, but we tell people to keep a distance of a few dozen centimeters.
Asked if it was far enough, a policeman said so.
Try to be positive, use the police, then use another measure.
The one with the mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
The flour: Among other things, anise can be added to reduce the workload
The connection to depression is not accidental.
According to the American Anxiety and Depression Association (ADAA), people with anorexia, a condition characterized by abdominal cramps, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and dizziness often experience anxiety and depression, which can lead to worsening of symptoms.
This is because the spleen is partly controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress, explains the ADAA.
If the temperature does not decrease, it may be a matter of food tolerance.
A judge tries to stop a ruling that the children be released from immigration custody
In her ruling on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee overturned the expected deadline, saying that U.S. immigration and customs authorities would not be required to release children unless one of the three ways outlined in her previous order could be done.
Gee, however, also highlighted this in his order that immigration and customs authorities carry out their previous duty to release the children without unnecessary punishment.
Three ways Gee recommends are to untie families held by immigration and customs authorities, put children in the hands of a custodian, or untie families from federal court orders.
Shalyn Fluharty, the director of Proyecto Dilley, a law firm that provides legal services to families in detention, condemned the decision and told her to leave it to immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to continue holding children.
"I think the problem is that children are being held indefinitely and they are not released unless the immigration and customs authorities agree or families agree to be separated", Fluharty said.
The family is held at three immigration and customs authorities locations in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley), and Karnes County, Texas.
Children in these settings are between the ages of 1 and 17, according to lawyers and legal representatives.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Babysitting, said in June that since there were no or poorly enforced rules on child molestation and social distancing, it would be necessary to remove children from these workplaces.
969 people in immigration and customs custody have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and are in isolation or surveillance as of July 23, according to immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 have been confirmed in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in family detention centres.
In total, more than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will consider the legislation on the independence of the governing bodies
The Prime Minister does not say that it is unusual for the life insurance funds to set standards in their investment policies for the rights of working people.
The comments of the Governor on the need to ensure the independence of the directors of the credit institutions, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
Following discussions with the Icelandic Air Transport Association and the termination of all airlines, the VR Board of Directors stated that the directors appointed by VR to the Board of the Icelandic Air Transport Association were either fraudulent or voted against the participation of the Icelandic Air Transport Association in the Icelandair's expected share offer.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, said that the board members would be replaced if they did not follow the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his statement three days later and the VR leadership too.
Asgeir Jonsson, the central bank's governor, told RÚV news on Friday that the independence of the directors of the life insurance funds must be ensured in the approval of the funds and possibly through a change in legislation.
Prime Minister Catherine Jacobs's daughter says it is important that the governors of the life insurance funds are independent, but she already believes it is protected by law.
"The Governor of the Central Bank, who is of course with the Financial Supervisory Authority, who is involved in this, has said that the regulatory framework around this independence needs to be examined in particular, and we will of course take that into consideration if anything needs to be done there", she says.
Catherine says that the law requires that life insurance funds set ethical standards in their investment policies.
It should address the social and moral aspects that they want to emphasize in their investments.
I also felt that it was not unreasonable for the private sector to set standards for the rights of workers in their investment policies.
But I think it's normal for such decisions to be made through consultation rather than through individual investment criteria,' says Catherine.
'Transaction at the Olivet Bridge is unbearable,' says the mayor of Árborg
Helgi S. Haraldsson, chairman of the City Council of Árborg, says the traffic jam that forms on the Olive River Bridge on Selfossi daily is completely unbearable.
He hopes to have a new bridge over the Olive River auctioned in the fall.
Now that Icelanders are traveling around their country and there is a lot of traffic on the country's highways, daily traffic jams are created at the Olive River Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the town.
Long lines form at the bridges and may require the driver's patience to wait in line.
Well, that's totally unbearable, it's a traffic jam here and not just on Fridays because it's just happened on weekdays too.
There are long begs, sometimes quite high on Hellishide for those who want to get here on their way east and those who are coming west, so it gives the impression that we need to get a new bridge no later than yesterday", says Helgi S. Haraldsson, mayor of Árborg.
Helgi says that the Árborg City Council recently met with the Director of the Vegagerða and designed the Vegagerða, and that meeting was very positive.
If you've ever been optimistic that there's been work on these issues, I think I can say that now because there's really been work on this and we should be able to see a new bridge being offered this fall.
But is there any advice for the drivers who wait on the Olive River Bridge every day during the summer?
Well, the fact that you can go through the Tribulation and through the Eyre, it's faster than those who are going east on the bend, you can't tell them to go to the Lyngdals Valley, but those who are going to the riots should use the Mosfells Valley, the Senate and the Lyngdals Valley.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, the president of the City Council of Árborg, who says the traffic congestion that is taking place at the Olive River Bridge at Selfoss is intolerable.
Long lines form each day at the Olive Bridge, and drivers often have to wait long enough to cross.
Then the only way to do that is to take a deep breath and think positively.
The future of the coal mines in north Brisbane is subject to planning
The city said that in addition to being a vital habitat for koala beans, maple seeds, and the grey gas shark, the area was an important link between the Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek natural areas.
Commissioners have appealed the City Council's decision to the Planning and Environment Court, arguing that the construction would comply with the 2014 Urban Planning Act, would meet an unmet planning and community need and could proceed without undue impact.
These planned projects are met with considerable opposition in the vicinity.
The Commissioners argue that, although the proposal is fully in line with the scheme, it could be changed if it fails to meet the requirements rather than rejected.
The project also includes a number of stages, including a service center, child care facilities, and 39 apartment buildings.
Over 120 public submissions were made at the time of the consultation, and most objected to the proposal because it was too large and unsuitable for the area.
The Brisbane City Council minority leader said the city would have to buy the land to protect the coal mine.
Adrian Schrinner must stop harming taxpayer funds in a fight with the commissioner for justice and buy this land to protect Brisbane's wildlife, said city councillor Cassidy.
 These are one of the most important coalfields in the Mountain to Mangroves Natural Area and are home to a large number of coalfields.
Schrinner said this week that the city wanted to keep the local coal miners safe.
'We found the proposal unsuitable for the area,' said Schrinner.
I understand that this is now going through the judicial system and obviously we hope that it will lead to a positive outcome that will help preserve the world's information.
Schrinner said that mapping the location of the koala trees was a joint responsibility of the city and state governments, but that the government was responsible for the detailed maps of the location of the koala trees that local authorities support when they accept applications for treatment.
Sunshine: The next step is to get something done
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Man Utd, was hoping for a fight with the team securing third place in the Premier League today.
The team will therefore play in the European Championship next season.
United needed a draw or a win against Leicester today and the result was a 2-0 win for the Red Devils.
A good chance for the players to finish third based on the situation of the season.
I think we the Stakes have probably gotten over the mental fence by winning a game this big, as we've lost two playoff games this season.
We knew we needed a final today, now we can have the next chapter where these guys are winning titles", Solskjaer said victoriously.
Manchester United still have a chance to win the title this season, but they play in the Europa League in August and are so good that they have reached the eighth round of the competition.
Armistice begins at midnight in war-torn eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine  The Ukrainian army and the opposition forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a full ceasefire that is set to begin at midnight and which representatives hope will be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
Opposition officials said on Sunday that they had ordered their troops to cease fire and issued a ban on the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly said that they are preparing for the ceasefire.
If it continues, it would pave the way for the implementation of other provisions of the Minsk Peace Accord, according to a statement by the Office of the President of Ukraine earlier this week, where the ceasefire was called a timely measure.
The goal of the Minsk Peace Agreement, concluded in 2015 for the annexation of France and Germany, was to resolve the conflicts between Ukraine and the separatists who enjoy full Russian autonomy, but the conflict began in 2014 after Russia's accession to the Crimea and its support for the separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine celebrated the ceasefire in a telephone call on Sunday, stressing the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris summit in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern over Kiev's call for a review of the Minsk Agreement, saying that the resignation of Ukrainian President Vladimir Selensky on the Minsk Agreement's "extreme nature", which he reiterated in this call, should be reflected in real action.
However, Selenskiy stressed the need for more frequent action to free Ukrainians held captive by insurgents in eastern Ukraine, the inland Crimean Peninsula and Russia, according to a statement from the President's Office.
Under the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only gain control of the borders with Russia in the territories under the Secessionist control after it has been granted wide autonomy and elections have been held in the territories.
The alliance withdrew from the fighting, but the Ukrainian army and insurgents have continued to fire.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for further talks, support for the Minsk Accord was revealed and the peace process agreed to resume.
Selensky, who won the 2019 election with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to gain control of the border before the first regional elections, but the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be implemented without amendment.
The new non-proliferation agreement was reached on Wednesday with the support of a trilateral cooperation group, composed of representatives of Russia and Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and was thus welcomed by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday Mass of St. Peter's, Pope Francis also recalled the arms race, saying that the people needed to trust and lay the groundwork for a very necessary and long-lasting peace with the people.
Police: Man shot to death in a protest in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  A man was shot to death in a protest in Texas as he approached a car and the driver of the car dropped his weapon, police said.
Katrina Ratliff, a police spokeswoman, told reporters early Sunday that the shooting occurred just before 10:00 p.m. at a protest in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
The car had flooded, paved a road, and then accelerated toward the protesters, witness Michael Capochiano told the Austin American-Statesman.
The man, who was carrying a rifle, Capochiano said, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then went off the rails, Capochiano said.
Ratliff told reporters that initial reports suggested the victim may have been carrying a rifle, adding that the suspect was in custody and willing to cooperate with police.
According to news reports, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protests were streamed live on Facebook, where the car was floating and several shots were fired.
The first victory of Blika in July
Breedlip won their first division title since June 29th, when the team beat the I.A. 53, in the men's Pepsi Max division at the Copa Vogue Stadium tonight.
The Scammers are losing their third straight game in the league.
After winning their first three games in the league, Breedablik played five games without a victory celebration and had lost three straight to the I.A. tonight.
It was to strike or kill for Blika who were putting great force into the game.
Alexander Helgi Victorson led the team with a legally binding dismissal on the 11th minute after Krist Kristin Steindorson had sent him through the IA defense.
Six minutes later, Christ doubled the lead after the most lavish preparation of the Son of the Hostage of the Elder from the left corner.
The first half saw no land or beaches for the contestants, who were given a huge opportunity by local superstars to connect their shows.
The Blitz were in full control of the field and scored the third goal in the 36th minute when Danish coach Thomas Mikkelsen scored the cornerstone of the Gunnlaugsson High School.
Then Kristin Steindorson scored his second goal and Blika's fourth just three minutes later.
But the story of the first half didn't end there.
The players were given hope for the latter when Hrafn Haraldsson scored from the white field shortly before the game, but Kwame Quee had then cracked Victory Jonsyni in the Blika tie.
41 was therefore the place for the Broadcast when the half-flat gall.
Only three minutes into the second half, the Scammers scored again.
The only other player left was a lone, uncontrolled player at the Blika goal line, who could easily control the ball at the corner of the safe Lord Haraldson's corner.
However, a breakthrough within the IA brand happened just three minutes later when he broke on Alexander Helga.
The wicket was decided and Thomas Mikkelsen scored out of safety to cross the 52 mark with only seven minutes left in the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, the Skaggs shot again.
Then, under pressure from Victor Jonasson, Anton Einarsson, the goalkeeper of Blika, gave the ball to Victor's feet from where the ball was thrown.
An incredible 53 came with less than 10 minutes left in the second half, but the March tie was delayed.
Despite the good odds of the teams to score goals, including the two deadly Kwame Quee from the Breedabliki, they were not more than 53 victories from the Breedabliki final.
Breadeblik won their first win in a month, starting on 29 June, and finished the season with 14 points from third place, two points from Val, who is the top seed, and three points from top team KR.
KR and Valur both have a game inside Blika, though.
The A's have to settle for a third straight loss in the league, but the team is 10 points clear of the 8th seed, 5 points from the fall.
The dog community is safe despite White House announcements
The producers of the Dog Club yesterday announced that they would not stop showing the baby stuff in the near future.
The announcement follows White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany's comments that the series, which includes law enforcement dogs, were victims of "cancel culture".
The Canadian producers of the show responded quickly to McEnany's comments, suggesting that their fans should not worry about the future of the Puppy Show.
Several television series about police work have been taken off the air in the United States recently following protests against police violence.
The dog club is not included, though it has been promoting the subject on social media.
At a White House press conference on Friday, McEnany said that Trump is the president of the United States against the "culture of prostitution", especially when it comes to the police.
The term refers to when a statement or action by an individual or company provokes a harsh reaction on social media and is called after the person is engaged in a protest.
We saw a few weeks ago that the puppy show, the children's stuff about the cops, was stopped.
"It's the same with the show Cops and Live PD", McEnany said Friday.
She added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego has withdrawn its legal tender, but no evidence is available for the claim, according to Lego's defense counsel.
However, it is true that the reality shows Cops and Live PD were recently taken off the air in the West.
Both are also subject to a penalty for showing actual police work without the permission of the persons appearing there.
29 Years Together - Sometimes with a breakdown and a dry spell
Family therapist Kristín Tomásdóttir answers questions about family, children, and love in Family Hour DV.
This time, she answers readers who have never been lonely.
We've been together since we were 15, we've been together for 29 years, and we have two kids.
We had no choice but to be together and we felt good, but we both felt like we were missing something.
We've never been with another person and we have no comparison as to how this could be different.
This has sometimes led to disagreements and distrust regarding whether the other person is looking around, thinking about estrangement, or even divorce, and making changes.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is the kind of snare that always hangs over us.
Any advice?
Thank you for your excellent question, and I am so glad that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings about the relationship.
What would scare me is if you were thinking about this in either corner, couldn't discuss it, and even took some step that you could look at later.
Everything on the tables, isn't it always best?
A strong self-image is the most predictive of future happiness and the stronger you are, the more likely you are to have a stronger self-image partner.
The reason relationships that begin in adolescence do not always last a lifetime is often because people grow up in the right direction, but in cases where sexual influences occur, individuals can become stronger than many others.
As your relationship begins to develop during your most challenging years, you may conclude that you have grown together and have had a positive impact on each other's self-image.
We're supposed to be opposed to the relationships we're in.
The way I speak is contrary to the way you listen.
How I look depends on how you see me.
Connections shape who we are.
Could you turn the figure around and think, what do we have that others don't?
What makes us so special over these many years?
I'll admit the benefits may be much higher than the odds.
You've been shaping each other for years, and for a long time, you've been shaping up to a millimeter.
There's more to it than most people can say.
What's that worth?
You talk about feeling that you've lost something, but it's important to remember that big changes like divorce and a new relationship also come with fish that you're not necessarily excited about.
You may miss out on starting over, learning to be alone again, meeting new people, and starting families.
This will be followed by new challenges, new challenges, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this doesn't just come with a pale cloud of happiness, anger, at your age, it can become a daunting task, which may never be as successful as you've already done with each other.
Is it worth it?
Would it not be wise to focus on what you can do to increase tension, unpredictability, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the back.
There are many things you can do to deepen your long-standing relationship.
What experiments can you do in this regard?
What do you need from your husband that you're not getting?
What can you give your spouse that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is a significant increase in dislike for different forms of relationships, and couples have begun to define their relationships in different ways, such as open relationships, multiple relationships, or deciding to temporarily break up.
I'm not telling you what to do, no one's an expert on your solution, but maybe it would ease this heavy load on you if you looked at it and thought about the solution.
What do you need so much for the loss of faith and fear?
You've been together for 29 years, which means you've been doing a lot together.
Use that as strength and hold hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to send their questions and concerns to Kristina by e-mail at: maritalbandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in Family Hour, of course anonymously and in full confidence.
Missed the Cup and Broke It
Despite his extensive experience of raising bikers and celebrating titles, Branislav Ivanovic missed out on a glorious prize attack in the festivities after becoming Russian biker champion yesterday.
Ivanovic won numerous titles as a Chelsea player between 2008 and 2017, but then returned to Russia and joined Zenit.
He has now become Russian champion for two consecutive years and yesterday secured the championship with a 1-0 victory at Khimki, where the winning goal came from the winning goal of Artem Dzyuba in the 84th minute.
The Russian Cup trophy is made of glass and when Ivanovic, Zenit's boss, dropped the cup to the ground, it broke, as you can see.
Ivanovic and his teammates did not let it go and continued the party until late into the night.
This is war!
Coleen Rooney speaks to lawyer Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie's The Apology with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend herself against allegations of vehicular injury against Rebekah Vardy.
After conversations between the football teammates went deep, their knowledge of the game was expected to be dramatically resolved.
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in the infamous injury case Johnny Depp to defend herself in her so-called Wagatha Christie affair with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday claims that Rooney had asked David Sherborne to defend herself against allegations that she had sustained injuries against Vardy, with claims that personal information had been leaked to the media by her Instagram account.
The news comes days after evidence was brought to the Supreme Court that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, suffered physically and mentally as Coleen Rooney confirmed.
The paper reports that the mother of five children, 38, suffered severe seizures and anxiety disorders, so she was afraid to leave the house, and that Vardy, who had arrived seven months earlier, had been hospitalized three times... because of the anxiety that may have led to the procedure and its consequences.
In addition to being Depp's lawyer in his injury case against The Sun, over allegations that the actor had barred his wife, Sherborne, 50, takes up the case of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their private case against the Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After the two football fans' failed talks, those familiar with the matter expect a dramatic settlement in the courtroom.
"If you thought the Depp trial was a video game, don't ignore the football fans' upcoming war", said one source.
This is a real war, and Coleen is not giving up, and neither is Becky.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone using Rebekah Vardy's Instagram account had leaked a story about her to the newspaper.
She was named Wagatha Christie after clarifying how she spent five months slowly limiting the number of friends who could see updates on her Instagram stories, until only Vardy's account was left.
Coleen then claims to have posted a fake story on Instagram, which was later published in a gossip newspaper.
In her case file, Vardy, who denies any involvement, claims that she was turned into a bloodthirsty prostitute after Rooney published the allegations to the Council of State, with the aim of causing great harm and immense suffering.
Coleen's lawyers have questioned her claims, saying that the evidence of her suffering is only presented to the media and draws attention from the facts of the case.
The host said, "Becky's story is a misnomer, it's all a hoax".
It is the lawyer Paul Lunt of the Brabners Law School in Liverpool who is handling the case of Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy is with the Kingsley Napley Law Firm in London, it's unknown if she's hired a lawyer yet.
Spokeswoman Coleen Rooney declined to interview.
Biden's campaign denies Fox News Sunday an interview a week after Chris Wallace interviewed Trump
In an interview with Chris Wallace last week, Trump questioned whether the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, would handle the flood of questions Wallace had thrown at Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question, at least not for a while.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden's polling team had told Fox News that he was not available for an interview.
"In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, would be in a similar situation", Wallace said.
 This week, we were both interviewing Biden's election team and they said the former vice president was not vacant.
"We keep asking every week", he added.
Trump's election team has been criticizing Biden for months for avoiding election meetings and press conferences while he is interviewed during the coronavirus pandemic.
While Biden recently resumed his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to sue the former vice president for assaulting himself at his home in Delaware.
Biden's willingness to attend public events, however, has not diminished his performance, as recent statistics show Biden has a strong lead over Trump both nationally and in the mainstream.
Real Clear Politics averages indicate that the president was 7 percent down in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 percent in Michigan, and 6.4 percent in Wisconsin.
Trump won all four states in 2016, and he's tied them to the Republican Party when he won the White House race.
In the latest Fox News Poll, Biden is ahead of Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, outside of the checkout market in any case.
The reports also suggest that Biden has a slight lead in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other major contenders in this election.
And research suggests that states that once trusted Republican protections, like Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which the incumbent president is running for a second term in the White House are often a vote for that president  and that seems to be the case now in 2020 in the Trump-Biden battle.
The most preparatory issues have been the coronavirus and the economy in crisis and the performance and history of the president in both categories.
Kanye West and his mental health crisis
Musician Kanye West today apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for making a statement that he over-exaggerated.
A psychotherapist's boss thinks he's putting his creative powers in the brain, but psychiatrists say it's important that people take medication to keep the disease in check.
Not only is rapper Kanye West one of the most original and influential musicians of all time, he is also famous as the husband of reality television star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has largely been spent in open tents.
He attracted a lot of attention when he announced earlier this month that he was running for president of the United States, giving a heartfelt and uncompromising speech.
Later, a special tweet from him appeared, stating that his wife was trying to get him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later posted a statement on Instagram asking people to show understanding to her husband and family; he had mental illness, and it was difficult for his loved ones to help him if he didn't want to seek help himself.
He has since publicly apologized to her.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of the population has mental health problems.
Ferdinand Jonsson is the chief psychiatrist at a London hospital, and he knows the disease well.
This disease can cause such an incredible amount of distress to individuals and especially to their families and loved ones.
This violence or mania can destroy relationships and jobs and cause untold sorrow.
And then the other side, depression, is often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice that she had to say this.
And it's just human and human, says Ferdinand.
Head Unnsteinsson, chairman of Mental Health, has himself been a fan of Kanye West's mental needs.
If we are four strings of earthly double bass, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And it is so super creative, super powerful, and clever in its powerful connectivity, because you become aware of this connectivity that we who have been given the opportunity to try to go beyond the limits of the universe know so well.
Kanye West doesn't want to take psycho drugs, because he thinks they're from his creative mind.
He has discussed mental health issues, including the album Ye.
The man says it's his choice not to take medication.
 Some people think it's the creative element that is embedded in this uncanny connection and the supernatural creative power of fire that it has, but so are the natural chains of so often great suffering, and the oil bubbles and the dark basements and darkness.
Ferdinand, however, says that it is important that people with mental illness receive treatment.
If you're a big fan or a maniac, you're not making great stuff, you're just on the side.
And just like when people go into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by the condition, he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medication?
"Finally", says Ferdinand.
 And especially working with someone to find the right shorthand and this way to balance the most beneficial and destructive medicines that are remembered for him and his talents and creative power.

Delhi Metro is building the first pillar of the fourth phase of construction
Delhi Metro has reached a significant stage in the fourth phase of construction. The first pillar was erected for the road between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being laid, workers said on Sunday.
The pillar was erected in Keshopur and on the upper part between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step in the fourth phase of construction. The first pillar of this stage of the railway expansion was laid for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, said the DMRC in a statement.
This "significant" project was achieved despite a severe shortage of workforce and other organizational challenges due to the global crisis, workers said.
The average height of the pillars on this road is 10 meters.
However, the pillars will be 20 metres high at Madhuban Chowk, where the road crosses Route 1, and 25 metres at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the road meets Route 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the bridge will be 28 metres high, the highest in the history of the Delhi Metro, the statement said.
The highest point of the railway system is at Dhaula Kuan, where the bridge to Route 7 reaches a height of 23.6 meters.
In the context of civil engineering, columns are vertical stress-bearing man-made structures that support the alignment of two ends of a track.
They form vertical man-made structures that carry the elevated railroad bridges.
These railway columns can be seen on the countless highways that line the Delhi subway system.
The number of pillars now plays an important role as a marker for the address of the Delhi metropolitan area.
The 28.92 km long journey from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an extension of the Magenta Road and will have 22 stations.
21.18 km of the route will be raised and 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction on this section began in December last year.
On July 17, work began on the underground section of the road when construction of a skid bridge at Krishna Park Extension railway station began.
On June 24, the DMRC began preparations to build a U-boat that would later be installed in the raised section of the route.
In the fourth stage of construction, 61,679 km of the new line will be built on three different lines with 45 stations.
These new components will provide connections between the parts of the rail system currently operated by the Delhi Metro.
Of these, 22.35 km will be underground, while the rest will be raised.

India, the third worst-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic after the United States and Brazil, has gradually increased its COVID-19 immunity rate and has performed more than 420,000 tests in one day, the health ministry said on Saturday, saying this was due to the increase in laboratories.
The global catastrophe has killed more than 633,000 people worldwide since its outbreak in China late last year, infecting more than 15.5 million people, according to AFP news agency.
A sick ambassador wants a gun, a car and a vest - said the submarines are the memories of the deep
The US ambassador to the country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is reportedly carrying a firearm in the CBS News today.
CBS News reports: "Despite being located in one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been a victim of security concerns since arriving in Reykjavik last year".
CBS's 12 diplomats, executives, and former officials, as well as individuals familiar with the matter.
Gunters' conclusion was to demand that the U.S. State Department request permission for the ill-manned ambassador to move arms here on the land.
He also must have requested a guarded car that would travel with him between Iceland and Stungu vest.
The U.S. State Department declined to comment on whether any threat to the ambassador's security was present, but officials from the U.S. government said that the ambassador had been told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Although the advertisement for life-saving measures was published in Icelandic newspapers, CBS reports, it is in line with the ambassador's demands.
According to CBS News, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the matter with CBS.
So far, the U.S. News Agency has told its representatives here in the country that there has been no wish for the country's government to do so.
In addition, CBS reports that Gunter has been accused of carrying weapons that would antagonize the host nation, Iceland.
The senator was rewarded for his generous support of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
He used to be a dermatologist in California.
Since Gunter took office in May, he has reportedly created a "possible" working environment at the embassy and has already had seven deputies, known as Deputy Chief of Mission, deputies of the ambassador who are also diplomats.
All were experienced diplomats from the U.S. State Department.
The first was sent away by the messenger because he did not like his appearance.
I've been preparing for a whole year and learning Icelandic.
The next one only appeared in six months.
Afterwards, a rotation of the staff was created, and the idea was to let Gunter mate with most until he liked one of them.
Furthermore, CBS reports that Gunter wanted the embassy staff to walk the bottom of the ship and to have dug it out of the way in front of the State Department in Washington, D.C.
D.C. State Department officials are well aware of the situation at their embassy in Reykjavik, but have been keen to take the brunt of the embassy's lack of control in light of Gunter's connection to the White House.
Gunter is also said to have had trouble following the State Department's orders in Washington, D.C., and is said to have refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 pandemic.
He left the mission in the hands of his staff for several months.
Is he said to have intended to work from his home in California unless directed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo himself to return?
♪ Finally back to the drawing board ♪
Having finally received the order, Gunter sailed back to Iceland in May.
His new assistant, Michelle Yerkin, arrived this month.
CBS has not received an answer to their request to the U.S. State Department.
The State Department refused to comment on CBS, nor on the DV request.
Gunter is one of the many political appointees of the Trump administration who has attracted attention for unusual behavior in recent months.
For example, Woody Johnson got a strong reaction when he came across the day he was trying to move the British Open golf championship to a golf course owned by Trump.
The South African ambassador has also denied the charge of running her number two and attempting to appoint her son to the post.
42% of the U.S. ambassadors are political appointees.
30% were political appointees in the Obama administration, and 32% in the George W. Bush administration.
Protesters and police in Seattle together because of Trump's plans to send there federal prosecutors
Seattle police used explosives and pipe bombs on protesters who lit fire in workhouses at a juvenile detention center on Saturday, following public outcry over President Donald Trump's plans to send federal police officers into major cities.
Repeated explosions swept through the streets of Seattle, Washington, and smoke exploded from the scene where protesters had set fire to motorhome buildings on a construction site near the juvenile prison.
Protesters ripped through the roofs of cars and broke windows in wheelchairs.
The police attacked the protesters, some of whom held up raincoats to protect the pepper springs that rained over them.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting police officers, obstructing police operations, or refusing to leave the area.
Poland will withdraw from the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence Against Women
Poland's government says it will withdraw from the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence Against Women.
The Istanbul Compromise is the world's first binding legislation aimed at preventing violence against women, but Poland's Justice Minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, described the text as "harmful" as he demanded that schools teach children about gender from a sociological perspective.
Ziobro said this weekend that on Monday he would begin preparing a formal process for the country to withdraw from the agreement.
This ideological aspect relates to attempts to change education in schools and leisure work, that it is about learning, attitudes and persuasion of the young Polish generation, from the conclusion that our view is wrong, that biological gender is obsolete and that everything is really about social culture sexuality.
Ziobro considers that the provisions of the Convention on the Education of Children and Young People and Family Relations in the context of LGBTQ people are unacceptable.
We also support the LGBT issue in the family-related debate, because it is the view held in the air by left activists or groups of gay people who want their views to be legally binding, he said.
The European Council said on Sunday that it was "unfortunate" that Poland was going to withdraw from the agreement.
In Warsaw, about 2,000 people, including women's groups and other rights groups, demonstrated outside the offices of the right-wing organization Ordo Luris, which supports the country's withdrawal from the treaty.
"We will not be victims", they called.
Protests also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention on the Prevention and Combat of Violence against Women and Domestic Violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a Desert Hall engineer, died aged 81.
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of the Quarterback Package Empire that includes his father Lee and brother Richard, and the first engineer admitted to the Nascar National Park, died Saturday.
He was 81.
Pettys' family didn't give up his cause of death.
No word yet on his execution.
While other members of his family were renowned for their skill behind the steering wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Steering wheel" for his skill with the screw.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven NASCAR Championships, and also built engines that secured victories for Hall of Fame teammates Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
"The board was one of the most accomplished engineers in NASCAR history", said chairman and CEO Jim France.
He brought the power that helped Petty Enterprises achieve its greatest success in sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the skin, he also played a variety of roles behind the tent and did what was necessary to get his vehicles on the road to victory.
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the racetrack when he was young and his knowledge of mechanical engineering soon became a key factor in Lee Petty's 54 race wins and three championships.
He raced 26 times in the NASCAR Cups from 1960-64, was in the top five seven times and in the top 10 16 times.
However, he soon decided to focus on what was happening underneath the wheel rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a good omen for his older brother, who rode his engine on his triumphal march.
Richard, then known as the King, won his first championship with the Captain in 1964 with the Plymouth Motorcycle.
They won again in 1967, then two years in a row in 1970 and 1971, and won three more titles before the 1980's ended.
With these seven titles on the back, they shared the record for most titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
"Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and during his career at Petty Enterprises he helped build one of the top teams in NASCAR", Winston Kelley said in a statement.
Although Petty's wins are recorded as 212 of his total, he's claimed well over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his rivals.
The manager will forever be remembered as one of the greatest engineers in NASCAR history.
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, wife of Maurice Petty for 52 years, died in 2014.
He was also the uncle of former driver and media personality Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, team manager of the Formula One World Championship.
"While we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and accomplished pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be preserved in our memory, kept up in the air and preserved for the foreseeable future", said Kelley.
"We send our deepest condolences to the Petty family.
Continuing to be held in a prison cell
The police in the capital had a lot to do today.
Among the tasks the police were given was to arrest a man at the police station on the Avenue of the Dead this morning.
He had recently escaped from prison, but he refused to leave, was arrested again, and disobeyed police orders to commit a crime.
"He earned himself a continuing stay with the police", the police diary says.
Other police missions include reporting a body attack in Breidholt at 11am this morning and having two men executed for it.
Then the police had a woman in a shopping mall in Copenhagen who had been sitting there as a beggar but had no money to pay the bill.
The average price of gasoline in the United States rises by one cent every two weeks to $2.25 a gallon
CAMARILLO, California  The average price of 87 octons of gasoline has risen by just over one cent in the past two weeks and is now at $2.25 a gallon.

Nationally, the highest average price of 87 octane gasoline is in San Francisco Bay, where it is 3.27 gallons.
The lowest average price is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where it's 1.79 gallons.

Sala Pedro of Chelsea confirmed and teammates greet him with a song in the dressing room
Chelsea manager Frank Lampard paid tribute to quarterback Pedro Rodriguez after he played his last game for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old agreed to extend his contract temporarily to finish the season at the club, but will eventually be transferred on a free transfer to AS Roma.
The Spanish international, who joined from Barcelona in 2015, has been a regular in Lampard's squad this season, having made just eight first-team appearances in the Premier League and making a total of 21 appearances in all competitions.
The West London club's manager in black confirmed Pedro's departure after the club secured a place in the top four with a 2-0 win over Wolves, as the club entered the classroom to play their final game.
"Pedro has played his last game for the club", Lampard told Sky Sports.
The boys paid tribute to him in the dressing room, and that is worthy of recognition considering his career as a whole and his association.
It was his last major league game, but he's been putting his sights on the team.
I would like to thank Pedro warmly and wish him success in the continuation.
He'll stay here for the rest of the game, but with him, a great player will go off, and the social spirit I witnessed after the game was quite special.
Pedro posted a farewell message after the game on his Twitter account, where he wrote: "My last game at Stamford Bridge.
I want to thank every single fan for their support over the years, the club for giving me the opportunity to be in black, and my teammates.
You will always have a place in my heart.
Let's go to the FA Cup now!!!
The Big Blue Mountain.
Pedro, who previously played as a forward for Barcelona, is leaving Chelsea after having been with the team since winning the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte, the FA Cup in 2018, and the Europa League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
Another arrest was made
A man was arrested a second time at an awkward time this morning after refusing to leave the police station after his release from custody.
The man was arrested overnight for drunk driving and was held in a prison cell for the night.
When he was released this morning, he refused to leave and reported to the police several times.
He disobeyed the police's strict orders to commit crimes and thus continued to remain with the police, according to the Metropolitan Police Journal.
Restaurant that adheres to the two-meter rule
It's amazing to see restaurants stick to the 10-foot rule to keep their restaurants open and respect all the rules that have been set.
Here are some pictures from the outside world, where the atmosphere is slightly different from here on the mainland.
Armies destroy camps and capture the refugees in the Zamfara Kingdom
The airstrikes conducted by the HADARIN DAJI air division have destroyed the new camp of a group led by the so-called Dangote in the Doumborou forest in Zamfara State.
Lieutenant Colonel John Enenche, a defense official, said the airstrike, which also killed several civilians, was carried out as a result of a HUMINT operation and a number of air traffic control missions to confirm.
Enenche, a lieutenant, said that the scouts had revealed that members of the village had fled their former residence in a rocky mountain in the forest with their homes, motorbikes, and hundreds of chairs.
Enenche said that in the future, the air force had sent a special convoy of fighter jets and armed helicopters from the Nigerian Army to attack the area.
The attackers fired sharp shots at the area and shot down several of the security guards.
Many others who were seen trying to flee the area in the midst of the turmoil were subjected to further attacks.
In addition to praising the air force of Operation HADARIN DAJI for their professional skills, the Air Force's commander, Sadique Abubakar, a flight attendant, urged the local community to give up on airstrikes on the Vikings.
The military commander ordered them to continue their air operations in support of land operations, to rebuild all the fortifications and restore calm to the northwest and central regions of the country.
Suspicions of the First Coronavirus Myth in North Korea
The North Korean state news agency reported yesterday that the first COVID-19 case was likely reported in the country.
According to the report, the infected man fled the country three years ago but returned to North Korea last week.
The man was in the border city of Kaesong when he was diagnosed with the coronavirus, and the city has been isolated and a roadblock has been put on residents.
North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un called an emergency meeting with senior officials to discuss the response to the bad news.
State-run news reports said Kim ordered the seizure to be carried out by the "maximum security measures" to start the spread of the virus.
He also suggested that an investigation be conducted into the man's unwittingness to cross the well-guarded border between the two Koreas, and warned that those responsible should be punished severely.

Serbia wants to increase its military aircraft in the wake of rising tensions in Balkan history
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its military and seek to buy more military aircraft as tensions ease in the Balkans, the Serbian president said on Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said that some negotiations were underway to buy a fleet of weapons, accusing the United States and other Western countries of having the arsenal of NATO-member Serbian neighbors, as well as Kosovo, formerly a province of Serbia.
"The United Nations, the Turks and the Germans are thinking well of their beloved bomb", Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said the United States had recently handed over a number of vehicles to Kosovo's security forces.
During a visit to the Serbian military's military intelligence unit, Vucic said his nation could not compete with NATO's proposals to disarm its neighbors and that's why we've come up against ourselves.
Vucic did not specify what type of military aircraft Serbia was planning to buy, but government-backed media say his government has officially requested the delivery of 20 US-made warplanes.
Washington has not responded to the request from Belgrade and if it is rejected, it is likely to buy Russian Sukhoi-25s.
Serbia, which maintains a military neutrality, recently received a state-of-the-art air defense system from Russia, which has also developed weapons, attack helicopters and armoured vehicles.
China, also an ally of Serbia, has handed over drones to the state for military use.
U.S. officials have openly discussed sanctions against Serbia if more weapons are brought to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of nearby NATO member states.
In the West and in neighboring Serbia, people are concerned about the Russian and Chinese arms deployment in Serbia.
Tensions are now rising in the Balkans, but they were plagued by civil war in the 1920's.
The Atlantic Treaty Organization had ordered Serbia to stop Serbian bloody actions against the secessionist Kosovo-Albania in 1999.
Despite its formal bid to join the European Union, the populist leader Serbia has strengthened its political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, along with Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: The incidence of this preventable disease can be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
New research suggests that a certain kindness may be beneficial for the heart muscle.
What is it, and how could it reduce the risk of heart attack?
Scientists have collected a collection of coronary artery disease spanning five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) are three: heart attack, heart attack, and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include heart failure and high feeding.
Sugar contains heart-healthy nutrients, such as flavonoids, methylxanthin, polyphenols, and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.
Good cholesterol, also known as high-density protein, accumulates seed cholesterol  a type of cholesterol that narrows the heart's arteries  and transports it to the liver.
Bad cholesterol (low-density protein) is broken down in the liver and then excreted from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dosage or type of chocolate consumed.
It is unclear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or other cocoa sweetener.
The results were based on an earlier study that found that eating coconuts (found in chocolate) reduced the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve exercise.
Activity refers to the extent to which the blood circulates oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carries waste products away.
No lifestyle factors were reported in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said that those who admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to gain a healthy weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and experience less stress.
"Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system", she added.
Coles is trading plastic toys for books in a new collection scouting campaign
"We really listened and it was a very important part of the project preparation", Ronson said.
 We do not believe that people want to recycle the books  we believe that they will want to have them, but they can return them to their homes if they want.
Ronson said the new ad campaign had been in the works long before COVID-19 came to light, and despite the crisis, she believes the timing of the new campaign was "broken" by how much time parents now spend with their children.
While reporters have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of repeated toy collection campaigns in the largest supermarkets, Ronson says there is no sign of fatigue yet.
"We have not seen anything like this yet, but we are always looking at it", she said.
 We process a huge amount of data, week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we leave behind is consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes who paved the way for the collection campaigns on board the Little Shop in Australia, but the first in mid-2018 was the driving force behind the largest quarterly sales of the wholesale market since its inception.
Woolworths followed up with Lion King Oosheis, which also helped the supermarket to increase its sales, and now the environmentally friendly Discovery Garden campaign offers customers free herbs and flowers for vegetable planting.
However, the new collection campaign may have less impact this time around as UBS analysts predict increased sales at major retailers in Australia for most of fiscal 2021.
Ronson said customers could expect more diverse collection campaigns in the future and that campaigns aboard the Little Shop would likely be more rare.
"There are a lot of global collecting campaigns we look at and we are increasingly seeking inspiration from other countries", she said.
We need to do that to ensure we do better and better with our customers.
Planned to go five rounds around the country this summer
Light artist and producer Jón Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been increasingly under the spotlight in Iceland since the end of the Great Depression.
Jón completed his Bachelor's degree in Business Administration at the University of Reykjavík a few years ago, but now works in travel and marketing for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early in Jonah's life, or in April, when he traveled throughout the West Bank and stayed in his car.
In the past year, he's been around the country five or six times.
In addition, he has made countless day trips back and forth.
What journey has it taken?
For someone like me who's always on the fence and has seen everything, it's hard to name a favorite place.
It's more the weather and the social environment that matters.
I've been through a lot of things lately since those roads opened in June.
These trips are always successful because there are so many adventures to reach.
The last trip there is probably the year's favourite, but then we took 25 of us together in 5 big cars up the River Plate and from there to the Atlantic Ocean.
What's in store for you this summer?
It's very exciting for me the next time, but I was finishing my shopping course with DIVE and now I'm taking shopping trips here and there around Iceland.
So I was adding a brimstone to my daughter's box so I'd be more out to sea than I was before.
I'm going on a 10-day solo trip with everything I need on my back, but it'll be revealed later this summer where I'm going.
Otherwise I'll be on a lot of hives the next day because you can't see that area all year.
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
It's always hard to pick one place, but Christmas Valley has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
Every summer, my family and I would go to a place in the roots of the Americas, and since then I have always enjoyed the area.
I feel safe to say that I have been there over 100 times.
What place in Iceland do you recommend people visit?
I'm going to bring one from every corner of the country, but they're: Moose wolves in the South, Steppe in the East, Aldey Sea Falls in the North, Red Sands in the West, Snow White in the West and last but not least...
What is essential in travel?
"I'm not going ashore unless I have the following in my car: good vaseline, hanging room, rafting knife, hunting knife, turkey, cold box and Ethiopian... those who know me know what I'm talking about".
Searching for 24 calm people who are feared to have drowned off an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  Malaysian authorities said on Sunday that they were looking for 25 peaceful refugees who are believed to have drowned after they jumped off the tourist island of Langkawi, in northern Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official with the Malaysian Coast Guard, said that early police information showed that only one of the 25 calm men who had jumped off the boat had managed to swim to land.
The survivor sought help from police late Saturday and has been detained while the case is being investigated, Zawawi said.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees have fled Myanmar because of military action, many of them living in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims make up the majority of the population in Malaysia, which has long been a hotbed of both sides promising refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said two ships and airplanes were used in the search.
He said that the Coast Guard also reminded local seafarers and authorities in neighboring Thailand to assist in the search.
He didn't give any further information about the boat.
Last month, Malaysian authorities detained 269 peaceful refugees and found bodies aboard a boat suspected of smuggling off the coast of Langkawi, but they claimed he was deliberately damaged so he could not return to sea.
The Malaysian Coast Guard later said that the 269 individuals had been transported from a larger ship with dozens of people believed to have died and that their bodies had been dumped at sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia could not accept more peaceful refugees as it is facing economic hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic.
He said, however, that those already in the country would not be sent back to sea.
More than 2 million illegal immigrants live in Malaysia, as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers, including 101,000 internally displaced persons registered with the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Aswan residents collect, guard and return a chocolate farm to Sudan by car
A truckload of tons of chocolate headed for Sudan crashed into the international airport between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the street corner of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver collapsed due to heat.
The townspeople rushed to help the driver, who was lying there, and rescue the alarm that had broken.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, explained his position so that the driver was on his way to our village; we could not just stop.
We are to help people in need, no matter where they come from.
He added that villagers had taken an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the farm of the van, valued at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said villagers have been on the scene from morning till evening, saving as much of the farm as they could.
"What we felt was most important was saving the driver's life, protecting the farm and reopening the world", he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and home cleaning, Bahr said, adding that they just wanted to make sure he got to and from the village safely.
There were already breaches in Congress, and the coronavirus could make them worse.
"The global crisis itself is a call for our elected representatives to provide the leadership and vision we expect in difficult times", says a report drawn from a series of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication studies at American University, and Mark Sobol, an author and expert on organizational development and management.
 But we also face other debts related to the heritage of our nation and the racial confederacy that has ruined our country since its founding.
The study examined the known chemistry of the poor state of parliament: a lack of real inter-party connections, a schedule that limits opportunities for communication, excessive inclusion of power in leadership positions, repeated demands for a quartet, speculation about inter-party cooperation, the negative influence of the media that are active all day, the fact that the most important elections for parliamentarians are often primaries and, ultimately, the silence of minorities.
It is also warned that the Internet will become more accessible to Congress because of the global crisis, as a system that allows for local elections in the House of Representatives without congressmen having to travel to Washington could add to the problems.
If the idea of a remote conference were to be established, it would be a serious setback for efforts to increase inter-group communication, the report says.
"The global crisis has forced the Parliament to move most of its activities online, and we certainly understand why", the report says.
But even though it was necessary, such a thing should not be interpreted as virtue.
The document says that the parliament needs more than less communication between members, face-to-face.
They need to know each other better, have courteous conversations to find common ground, and build trust-based relationships that can lead to greater understanding and resolution.
The call for courtesy was especially relevant this week when Republican Senator Ted Yoho of Florida attacked Democratic Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez of New York with horses and his Republican colleagues to attack Republican Senator Liz Cheney of Wyoming with hostile words.
Senator Val Demings speaks about the vice presidency, let Trump hear it for the next few days.
Senator Val Demings (Democrat, Florida) was not shy about discussing her interest in serving as Vice President in the possible Joe Biden administration and expressed sincere gratitude for being nominated for the position.
This honored member of the Congressional Black Caucus interviewed BlackPressUSA on the live broadcast of the #FIYAH! Live show and told her story, her acting and her commitment that has brought her to where she is today, beginning with the words, "You know my whole story.
Demings was one of four House of Representatives prosecutors during the January Senate hearings of Donald Trump.
Whether or not the Senate impeaches Trump, he will go down in history as the fourth president to be impeached.
In an interview with NPR from his Capitol Hill office, this former House of Representatives prosecutor said, "Was it worth it?
She added that despite the disappointing decision, the Democrats would have had to follow suit regardless of the outcome.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that she opposes Trump's treatment of Rogers Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (and other crimes) and his treatment of other offenders convicted of similar crimes, she said, "Blessed are your friends who have lied and cheated to cover up your crimes".
Deamings tops Joe Biden's list of potential vice presidential candidates, which also includes CBC Chair Karen Bass (Democrat, California), former Georgia State Senator Stacey Abrams, Senators Camelo Harris (Democrat, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Democrat, Illinois), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice, and several others.
However, she noted that only one person would decide who would run for President Joe Biden in the fall.
That's Joe Biden.
Then she put her hand to her mouth while she laughed and whispered to those watching the live broadcast, adding, "If you want to call... please do it for me".
There is no doubt that, regardless of the political code of conduct, this period will be viewed in history books as a time of evolution in American politics and attitudes.
This didn't happen at Demings.
She recalled how many women come to the office for vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through what's left of the glass roof, especially for women of African descent.
"These are exactly the opportunities I have worked so hard to create my whole life for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don't have enough money or that they are of the wrong gender", she said.
The senator pledged to ensure that the Democratic National Committee and Biden's election team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many voters as possible.
"I'm going to call Tom Perez (DNC chairman) and I'm going to put this on top of my list", Demings promised.
She agreed that this should be done now rather than later in the campaign.
When she responded to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's words that Trump might refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial that said the president was preparing to achieve himself, Demings was moved: "No matter how much I strive to achieve myself, I was left to be ignored".
But who would ever do it but Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It shouldn't be possible to get away with breaking the law and ignoring the constitution in this job.
I think he hates the job, but he can't afford to lose.
I can totally believe the president won't want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if it does, I just want to be on the team that makes it happen.
Footwear for Children
There are glass glasses for children who want to drink with their parents from an early age in glasses that will fit their meals in better days.
Now there are probably some parents who celebrate or those parents who have been given the opportunity to play childish shorts with scratches.
But children do not look in their parents' mirrors, for they look more exciting to see on their feet.
This is the glass we discussed at modernhouseessentials.com, a website that stores various gold coins.
The glass has a good firm, stable foot and a good heat tolerance - so that children can enjoy the soup, whether hot or cold.
Each glass is about 150 ml.
Those who want to take a closer look at the glasses can visit the website HERE, but glasses are available these days for a small price of 3,400 ISK.
Alibaba and Jack Ma went to court in Gurugram because of the former employee's love affair
Gurugram, July 26: Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been sued in Gurugram after a former employee of the company claimed he had been fired for protesting the scrutiny and fake news in the company's software.
The case has been heard in Gurugram District Court and private trial judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a statement to Alibaba, Jack Ma and more than 10 others, asking them to appear in court on July 29, according to reports.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, is seeking $268,000 in damages, according to court documents.
We support the company's commitment to the Indian market and the wellbeing of its employees, and its policies are in line with applicable law.
We cannot comment on the prevailing case law", said UC India in a statement.
The lawsuit also includes lists of sensitive words containing keywords in Hindi and English on board the India-China border and the China-India war alleged in the lawsuit that UC Web uses to encrypt content on its systems in India, Reuters reported.
Last month, the Interior Ministry banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, including UC News and UC Browser, as tensions between the two countries escalated.
A New York City fire marshal says it's perfectly fine to exclude a white firefighter from a medal of honor.
A New York City Fire Department diversity representative says it's "very okay" to keep a white firefighter off the honor guard so that all of the victims can be black, according to a recent report.
White Firefighter Daniel McWilliams has filed a racial discrimination lawsuit after being removed from the group of victims at a memorial service in November 2017 to honor the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, the brotherhood of black firefighters.
The fire department's chief diversity and access officer, lawyer Cecilia Loving, further argued the decision in a hearing with the New York State Department of Human Rights, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of three firefighters in the Department who in a landmark film saw the American flag raised at Ground Zero in the days after the September 11 attacks.
According to the friend of McWilliams, the Fire Department had selected him to be one of the recipients of the memorial service.
To be a guest at this ceremony was a great honor and privilege for McWilliams, according to CNN's lawsuit.
However, when he attended the ceremony, he was meant to be a part of the funeral of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, who allegedly had asked that all the masses be black.
She then asked McWilliams, a 29-year-old New York City firefighter, to help in another way.
Among the things she allegedly asked him to do was to escort unchanged citizens and to remove the firefighters in their traditional attire.
McWilliams claims in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she would remove him from the honor because he was not black.
She confirmed it was, he said.
Wilson, who has been with the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the 9/11 rescue mission, will replace McWilliams with one of the Vulcan Society members.
McWilliams claims he left the memorial service to deal with further embarrassment, humiliation and scorn, as friends and colleagues heard what happened between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, a black woman, testified before a court, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked her: "So asking everyone to be black in honor is not discrimination?"
"No, it's not", said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was okay to pray that everyone was black in honor, to which she replied: "Everything".
Loving explained that it was okay to swap a white person for a black person to enhance our distinctive and different backgrounds to create pride, solidarity and support for each other.
McWilliams first filed a racial discrimination lawsuit with the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the New York City Fire Marshal, New York City and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams proposed his love affair, Wilson's supporters had avenged on him and threatened him.
At some point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams and said, "I've heard of you, they told me you'd behave like this, and now you know who I am".
Sullivan wrote in a letter that it would have been "horrible" to exclude McWilliams from the honorary oath at the Mass and the sign that one thing did not apply to all firefighters.
"If you're a black person and discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you're most likely to get a reminder", Sullivan said.
According to the lawsuit, Wilson was given an hour's counsel for her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives a severe punishment, Sullivan wrote.
"The New York City Fire Department has developed policies and procedures designed to please members of the Vulcan community who behave in a racist manner, forgive their actions and serve them... and this needs to stop", Sullivan also wrote.
He took a passenger by and brought back money
One was arrested in the city center after attempting to rob a pedestrian and try to collect money from a neighbor.
The man was kept in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the city centre.
The knife was made up and a report was taken by the correspondent.
About 80 cases entered the police station in the capital city from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. and were held in a jail cell this morning.
Police stopped a driver who had towed a bicycle house on Kjalarnes, where the bicycle equipment was in very poor condition.
The wheelchair was parked and the owner intended to provide a transportation facility to move it into the town.
Then the police stopped the drug production in the City.
Two were arrested in connection with the case and released at the end of the report.
There were also reports of individuals setting fire to aircraft in the City.
They were finished avoiding the scene when the police arrived at the scene, probably aware of the shame as there is still a considerable distance in the grid.
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand the apology of Putin
Thousands of citizens joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday to protest the arrest of the governor of the province of the same name in eastern Russia and the deposition of his heir, who has never lived in the province.
Former governor Sergei Furgal, who used a popular crowd and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and detained in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering the murder of three merchants 15 years ago.
Last week Furgal was officially removed as governor and his 39-year-old party brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, was appointed in his place, to the little favor of the locals.
Degtaryev is said to be untrue and, worse, unconnected to Khabarovsk and called on the citizens to apologize his way the quickest.
They're cold, Degtaryev has left like wind to the people's ears.
Yesterday's number of protesters was slightly lower than the first, or 15,000 to 20,000, and the demands were the same as before: the release of Furgall and the apology of Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia.
"We want the governor to be released, because we believe it is very likely that his arrest is illegal", AFP news agency quoted 30 protesters, Alinu Slepov, as saying.
It claims that the Kremlin emissaries had Furgal arrested to defend their own interests, not the interests of the province.
The police in Khabarovsk left the protesters unaffected despite the claim being a clear violation of the convention due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In Moscow, however, police arrested at least 10 people who had gathered in Pushkin Square to show support for the Khabarovsk protests, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgals's faction, the Free Democratic Party of Russia, is a faction of the hardline Nationalist Party, and is considered by political critics to be quite loyal to the Kremlin government on most issues.
However, the same political analysts inform the BBC that Furgals' victory in the provincial election two years ago  was a major and uncertain  was a significant blow to Putin and the United Russia, and although it suggests that the Kremlin's grip on the eastern territories was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 and taken to Moscow, where he awaits trial.
He's accused of ordering three murders between 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were in front, but the third went out into the deep.
Sarah Rainsford, a BBC reporter in Moscow, says Furgals' followers, who use a popular home-based service, are convinced that the charges and arrests have political roots.
They want to know why the government has been waiting to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged offense.
Trees were caught when the bear Hanna raided South Texas
Hurricane Hanna intensified into a tropical storm after landing on the southern Texas coast on Saturday, July 25, but authorities warned that the storm could still cause human-induced flash floods.
The U.S. Weather Bureau said heavy rainfall is the biggest threat in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico as the storm moves west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter, telling Storyful that he took it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disabilities taking part in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman trained as a dressmaker, visits 250 homes every day to diagnose people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid-infected area in Chennai, where there have been reported about 10,000 cases.
Her workday starts early, 7:30 a.m., and ends about 4 p.m.
She measures the temperature of the residents, asks about their symptoms, and teaches them the importance of wearing a mask, washing their hands regularly, and keeping distance from others.
Her work has even resulted in the timely diagnosis and treatment of infections in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 employees in Chennai City who handle the household appliances but are not healthcare professionals.
The project has reportedly contributed to a 50 percent decrease in the daily number of positive cases in Chennai, while it is increasing in other districts of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says not all residents are co-workers.
She adds: Most coworking spaces are open when a woman with a disability approaches them.
Some will be upset, though.
This is not to be concerned, though.
I feel like people should be safe.
When I get back the next day, the people are all over the place.
It helps to build good relationships.
And there are more women like Shanthi staying in the city's hostel for women with disabilities and putting the fight against Covid-19 on hold.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also disabled, has also taken part in the program as a overseer.
Although Kavitha has a custom-made bicycle, she walks to meet people and keeps her elevators.
"I'm pleased", she says of the decline in infections, but she adds: "I want to see them drop to maybe 100 a day.
I'm sure we can do that.
On the first floor of the guest house where the two live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball player in a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, send all the data from about 40 women to a web server in Chennai.
Matilda says she's not afraid of getting the coronavirus.
When we help others, God protects us, and he adds.
When asked what steps she takes, Manimekalai says: "I wear makeup, keep my distance, and often wash my hands.
I also drank Kabasura Kudineer, a siddha drink that boosts my immune system.
A few months ago, when the coronavirus first hit Chennai, these disabled women were saving their time and skills to make masks for the city's health workers.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao, the hostel's director and director of the Dorcas Research Institute, who runs the shield, says: "They adapt to the needs of every moment.
They used to need makeup, and they didn't leave their mark.
Now that the community has intervened, they have responded to the call.
The coronavirus outbreak in Tamil Nadu has now reached 200,000 after 6,989 new cases last solar cycle, but it is also the highest number of infections reported in a single day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died and 7,758 have reached the end of the solar cycle.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to get to the last of the teenagers in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a teenage boy in Helensburgh are now trying to compile a timeline of his last trips.
The body of 19-year-old Kirk Allan was found at his home in Johnson Court at approximately 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and police confirmed Sunday that he had now been charged in connection with the death.
He'll be in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police Chief Steve Martin said: "Our thoughts are with Kirks' family and friends during these difficult times.
The police will continue to work with the community and provide support.
Our research continues to point to a full picture of what happened, especially Kirks's last days of travel before his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death.
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox relate their experiences of discrimination
In recent weeks, it has become clear that many questions about racial rights in South African sports are still in the pipeline.
Building relationships need to take place and action is needed to ensure that everyone is welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former Proteas cricket star, let his former white teammates know about it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black teammates were "quota players".
Prince said the Proteas' black players have been officially named "quota players" by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though the black players on board with Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada achieved the highest standards in the sport, some people were still involved in the quota discussion.
Prince, now the head coach of the Cape Cobras, posted this statement on the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) website on Thursday night.
The aim of the organisation is to advance the fiery debate on historical racial rights in South African sports.
Like I said when I was on social media, it's not my intention to come and drag people's names down the drain, but these are real events...
You do everything right, but you still get infected.
Paul Roberts, a former musician and architect who became a programmer at NASA, now works for a software company.
He and his wife, a former Methodist hospital nurse who considers herself an optimist, held an online hobby and attended a Comic Con event years earlier.
Once a week, they play the beautiful Uno game with their two daughters, their daughter-in-law, and their seven-year-old granddaughter.
"They are incredible nerds", says Roman, 38, of his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, is aware of the dangers of global warming. She has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, which may put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a long-term lung disease and a vaginal disorder that keeps his neck open.
'We've been so careful, very careful, and kept ourselves away from people,' Sheryl Roberts said.
Her husband began working from home in the spring, when the plague ravaged Washington State, New York City, and other areas across the country.
Paul has been to the supermarket once during his school hours, and their only real date in the last few months, Sheryl says, was when they went to look at wildflowers through the window of their car.
Their youngest daughter also went with caution.
But then she came home from work one day in mid-June, feeling that she was allergic.
She soon developed a fever, headache, and decline, and lost all of the sense of taste and smell that is typical of the coronavirus.
She said, "I don't know what's going on, Mom, but I was wearing makeup, I was wearing gloves, I was washing my hands", Sheryl said.
You do everything right, but you still get infected.
Elaine Roberts, who tested positive for the coronavirus, did not become seriously ill.
Her parents, however, made matters worse.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to cough and then cough, just like their daughter, and they got so hot and a lot of work in their bodies.
Then he became very sick, very fast", said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he was beaten.
She carefully checked his oxygen levels.
It was low, and she asked their eldest daughter to accompany him to the emergency room, for the second time in two days.
The former royal couple found it to be a hound in the Queen's Christmas dress, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry of Great Britain found their grandmother, the Queen of Great Britain, to have been haunting them in her Christmas presentation.
In their new biography, Finding Freedom, they meet those in the movie theater who see the power of Christmas Eve.
The pictures on the desk of the Queen included Prince William, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, and Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen, even though Archie was born in May, but still remembered the boy who was her Majesty's eighth grandson.
The new book, due out in August, also says Meghan and Kate Middleton never became friends, as they struggled to overcome the overarching courtesy and only met a few times.
Yesterday, it was reported that the affair between Harry and his brother William ended years before his relationship with Meghan began, but that it culminated in the marriage of William and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex found him to be a "warlock" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and so it is said that he wanted to change things long before Meghan came into the story.
Conservative MPs accuse the Labour leader of wanting to keep public servants forever.
Conservative MPs accuse Labour leaders of wanting civil servants to be "forever" after leaders protested Boris Johnson's call for people to return to work
Labour leaders were accused of wanting workers to stay home forever after they protested Boris Johnson's call for people to return to work.
Conservative MPs were furious when a union of civil servants and civil servants told their associates to throw their feet up when their superiors ordered them to return to their jobs.
Former minister Andrew Percy said it was "illegal" that essential public services like issuing visas would be halted while public sector workers worked hard to keep the community going in the coronavirus era.
"It is unrelenting for people to refuse to return to work while workers in factories and warehouses across the country continue to work to feed public servants while this has taken place", he said.
Many of these workers now want to go on vacation but cannot because of the people who refuse to return to their safe workplace.
Employment leaders cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever  especially not now that we know people can safely return to work.
Following a call from the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed Public Service Operations Director, announced that the Ministry would be obliged to withdraw public service personnel from their homes and hasten their return to their workplace until 1 August.
The civil service told its associates, who number about 200,000, that they did not need to comply with this requirement, saying that it was political.
A spokesman for the Civil and Public Service Employees' Union, the UK's largest civil service union, said the requirement to return to work was not put forward to promote the health and safety of our workers or to boost the economy.
This is solely due to political pressure from Conservative MPs who demand that public services be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to employees is clear: If you are doing your homework and someone in your department asks you to return to work, do not take it for granted.
The dispute may have been caused by growing dissatisfaction with the delay in issuing visas because employees work from home, but about 400,000 people are now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.
The Home Office has now announced that it will seek to speed up applications from UK travellers over the next two weeks and from those who have been waiting for a visa for more than four weeks.
The Civil Service Association has admitted that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but it claims that the small and often tight offices make it difficult for the 4,000-person staff of the visa service to maintain the necessary distance every week.
Former Cabinet Secretary David Davis urged trade union leaders to act sensibly and seek ways to work with the government to get people back to their jobs.
He added that if he were in government, he would ask the labor leaders, "What do you want?
However, some of Britain's biggest companies have similarly ignored Johnson's advice to people to return to work.
A survey of larger workplaces with a total of about 400,000 workers revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Influence on history can play a significant role
The gift has been broken, but understanding and kindness should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only academic discipline that specifically deals with our history                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria completed a degree in Australian history out of a total of 49,324 who completed their undergraduate studies, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, that number has nearly halved, but nearly 100 fewer students enroll each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to study Australian history in 12th grade is that little has been done to stimulate their interest in the past years.
History is not even a single field of study, but it falls under the broader field of philosophy.
Therefore, students in grades 7 and 8 complete only one brief study on the Torres Strait Islander people and their culture.
In the ninth and tenth years, a second unit is on the Australian front in World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australian history in primary school.
In the ninth and tenth years, the second unit of choice is the period 1750-1918.
The three measures needed to save Australian history in Victorian schools are now in place.
First, history needs to become a more independent subject, like English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only taught as part of philosophy, it is not included in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in philosophy but have no history.
The historical skill at analyzing information is complex.
We need to hire more skilled historians to ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the history of Australia from 1788 to 1914 will become a must.
Students can appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to study Australian history in the 12th grade because then they would have had to learn the subject from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not bridge a deep gap between races.

Aaron Ellis in the European Cup final - Isaac replaced by a goal in the semi-final
Aron Elise Draandson has reached the final of the Danish Football League European Championship.
Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half with the top team of Norrköping against the bottom team of Falkenberg in Sweden.
Aron Ellis was in the OB team in Denmark when the team advanced to the final for the European League title.
OB will face AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final, but it depends on whether the teams finish higher after the final of the Danish top division later today.
Aaron Ellis played the entire game in a 1-1 draw with Horsens on home soil today, but OB had won the team's first home game, 31, thus winning the single game total 42.
Issak was in the starting line-up of Norrköping, who were unexpectedly 20 down after the first half against Falkenberg's bottom team in the Swedish Premier League.
Norway made a triple replacement at the start of the second half, and Isaac was one of those who needed to make a breakthrough.
Norrköping managed to level the score, but Falkenberg came in 32 in the 89th minute.
However, there was still time for Norrköping to recover from last minute expansion, 33.
Norrköping remains top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, who are due to play later today.
The stage allowed Falkenberg to get off the bottom for a while, but the team is a stage above Helsinki and Kalmar, which have a good game.
Collects records of the National Day in times of coronavirus
Anna Lilja Victory Daughter founded the Facebook group My National Day 2020 to collect information about the national holiday that the Islanders are planning to hold next weekend.
Many will go camping in their tents and enjoy themselves with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja was speaking to White on the weekend show.
"There's nothing that's been brought in yet that's very exciting because there are 600 people in the group so obviously people are going to do something", says Anna Lilja.
Something tells me the Islanders are going to have tent parties in their garden.
"People have talked about having their own [party], perhaps camping in the garden and gathering the family together, as is the custom at this time", says Anna.
People expect people to spend time with their people.
It does, however, say that many will likely not be there, but still celebrate a little National Day somewhere else.
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to refund the tickets purchased, but Anna believes many locals will rather secure tickets for next year's festival.
People are even investing in the middle now and getting it in 2021.
"I'm a big National Holidays person, I love the preparation and everything about it, but sometimes something comes into your life that you can't control and then it's just like that", says Anna, but the story has led some to ask if the people of the Islands can't just let go of National Holidays once.
Anna Lilja says she did not form the group for herself or to encourage people to celebrate their own National Day but to collect records of the Merchant of the Isles' annual festivals this year.
What were people doing in those strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one or anything but then come to the article someone who uses this kind of directory in something but I was just creating something area where people can input what it's doing.
In addition, the annual burning of the Faisal Rock has been added.
I think a lot of people are excited about getting burned on a Friday night.
The only thing that's obviously a trick to the account is that Spain is no spell.
"It will be burned in this fire, but it will only be revealed how it will be", says Anna Lilja.
The full interview with Anna Lily can be heard in the video below.
Will Prince Andrew be named in the new sexual assault case?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A US judge has ordered the classified Epstein and Maxwell documents to be made public.
Among the 80 pages of this document are excerpts from Maxwell's testimony from 2016
The impact of these sites could also put a lot of pressure on Prince Andrew as they contain a link between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015.
Virginia Roberts, a sex slave to the ill-fated American financier, claimed in court documents in 2015 that she had been forced to negotiate with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrew is now preparing to defend himself against a possible publication this week with even more damaging allegations of his friendship with child molester Jeffrey Epstein and his unintentional expert, Ghislaine Maxwell.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered this week the publication of about 80 classified legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, which number hundreds of pages.
The publication of this massive document would be a shock to the 58-year-old Maxwell, who has to keep a large part of her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said is "a wealth of questions" about her sex history.
They could also put a lot of pressure on Prince Andrew, as one of the files includes a January 2015 relationship between Maxwell and Epstein, when Virginia Roberts, allegedly a sex slave to the scorned American financier, claimed in court filings in 2015 that she had been forced to interview Prince Andrew three times.
Andrew has repeatedly and unreservedly denied these claims.
A 2015 leaked email from the BBC last year seems to suggest Andrés asked Maxwell for help in responding to Roberts' claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will receive a rebellious honor
There he said to the First Lady, "Let me know when we can talk. I have certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts".
Maxwell replied, "I have information. Call me when you have time".
Last night, a source close to Andrés said: "The Duke of York has done nothing wrong and we are not worried about opening court records.
As U.S. courts have argued, even if an accusation is recorded in court records, it does not mean that it is true.
U.S. courts have urged the media and the public to exercise strict caution in handling cases reported in court records.
We totally agree.
We have no doubt that the Duke will have a full rebellion in the coming weeks.
Maxwell is currently being held at a Manhattan detention center awaiting trial for the discovery and execution of some of Epstein's victims who were under investigation from 1994 to 1997.
She is also charged with conspiracy to deny testimony to reports of abuse.
She denies all the charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Roberts's injury case, now known by the surname Giuffre, which she adopted after her marriage.
About 40 of the 418 pages of such testimony were made public last year, but according to a decision by New York State Judge Presna last week, more could be opened first on Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers had one week to appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his New York jail cell last year awaiting trial for a sex crime.
Police are looking for a criminal gang after a violent attack on Edinburgh streets
Three men attacked a man in Edinburgh and gave him effects that might prove to be permanent.
The 29-year-old victim was attacked on Drum Street in Gilmerton, between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m. on Saturday.
Scottish police said he had been taken to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Detective Dale Miles, who leads the investigation, said: "This was a violent and accidental attack".
The other suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in his 40's, about 5'8" tall and strongly growing.
He was short-haired and dark-haired in white balls, dark pants and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said: "I would like to ask everyone in the area at the time of the attack who saw something suspicious to turn themselves in".
The ambassador wants to carry a gun to Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the US ambassador to Iceland, wants to carry guns here on the island and wants to increase security.
He's been reportedly a security nuisance since arriving in the country last year.
This is reported in CBS News, which also says this is Gunter's will, despite his work in one of the safest countries in the world.
Gunter is said to have asked the US State Department to ask the Icelandic authorities to let him carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a car and a vest to protect him from a knife.
CBS sources say the ministry has, however, briefly informed Gunter that he is not in danger to Iceland.
According to CBS, the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not provide information on whether a request from the United States for a possible Gunter weapon attack had been made, because the authorities did not comment on foreign security measures.
However, the news agency's sources say no request was made.
Then CBS also reported to its investigators that Gunter had been told not to apply for a gun because it would be considered a deterrent on the ground.
Gunter is inexperienced as a recalcitrant, but he has been a dermatologist in California for some years.
He is an active member of the Republican Party and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently attracted national attention when he spoke about the visible Chinese virus.
CBS sources also say Gunter has significantly lowered the morale of the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik.
He already had seven advisory staff at the embassy since May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the so-called "Deep State", a network of US officials working against Trump, and has been outraged by the fact that one person carried snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but in the end, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had to order him to return, and he did so in May.
The home format is the key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham have easier matches to play when fans can come back to the game
With Jose Mourinho's help, Tottenham Hotspur have not lost a game at home since the league resumed, but he says it would be easier to keep a good run at home for the fans if they were allowed to play.
The Spurs have won 12 games at home this season, but lost four times  only one of the six teams above them has lost more at home.
The Portuguese coach said that while such a victory would be possible without the fans, it would be easier to maintain if they were on the field.
'We have to do this with the fans. Without them, we can build some kind of tower, where the game plan is at the forefront,' he said.
But I think it would be more powerful to do it with the fans, because then you add the emotional side of the game, which only comes next with the help of fans at home.
Mourinho believes that with stronger competition, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long-term successes at the home ground he has known since Chelsea, or which Liverpool has built up over the past three seasons.
But it's also a key factor in determining whether teams reach their goals at the end of the season, especially in even-numbered games and neighborhood laws, where the atmosphere on the field can change creations.
I think the goal of the league is to make it harder and harder to beat that bad mark because of what the teams have done.
However, it is very important to be strong at home and have a number of home wins at the end of the season.
I'm happy with the results of the home games recently, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I see a win against Arsenal with a stadium full of Tottenham fans.
It's a little bit of a combination.
Buyers excited about the desirable lifestyle properties in Lovely Banks
"Bigger is better" is clearly the motto of the new owners of a giant property in the Lovely Banks neighborhood, which was recently sold for $1,270.
Interested shoppers looking for a way of life near Geelong's city center fled to explore this 1.35-acre [1.35 ha] plot of land, which offers a 14-car parking lot, a swimming pool, and views of Corio Bay.
Joe Grgic, a real estate developer in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that the bid for the land at Cuddihy Court 1 would have been approved within 10 days of its launch.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back for sale
Home option for isolation
"We received a number of offers from various parties", Grgic said.
The property is being sold to a local who is very excited.
The property is accompanied by a four-room two-story house, which includes a private bathroom large enough to accommodate a sofa bed.
The new owners have three rooms to choose from, and can use a new kitchen and an expanded outdoor pool.
"It was about how the property was assembled, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place", Grgic said.
Here came enthusiastic buyers from Melbourne who wondered what a central property it was, yet with a local flag.
I have people who lost and buyers who are still looking.
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a free-standing curtain that can accommodate 10-12 vehicles, would be perfect for industrialists or for storing wheelchairs and spare parts.
Endangering their security in Iceland
Despite being named the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been very concerned about his safety since arriving in Reykjavik last year.
This is the beginning of a detailed CBS News coverage of the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, but it is the beginning of a number of CBS foreign service reports.
In a CBS interview, Gunter allegedly requested the U.S. State Department to grant him a special permit from the Icelandic government to carry a firearm.
Then he must have also requested a guarded car, and he must have revised ideas about a vest that might protect him from knife attacks.
The US State Department declined to state publicly whether Gunter's security was actually threatened in Iceland, but according to official information, Gunter has been repeatedly told that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced a full-time lifeguard, including in the morning paper of July 18, but CBS forces say it's done to ease Gunter's concerns.
The U.S. State Department does not comment on any specific security measures in connection with its embassy, but it always states the goal of ensuring security by preventive means.
The Ministry does not answer questions about Gunter's request to disarm and the State Department does not want to say whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassador be allowed to carry firearms, and usually does not comment on the security of a foreign embassy.
However, according to its Icelandic agents, the request for the material was never made, and according to three US officials, Gunter was taken over by his plans as they could lead to a crackdown on Icelanders.
The CBS coverage also discusses the various problems that have plagued the U.S. Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his deputy secretary seven times.
So the first deputy said he had prepared for his job for a long time and learned Icelandic only to be denied the station at the last minute because Gunter didn't let him at their first meeting.
His descendants have not fared much better under Gunter's command.
The US State Department officials are said to be aware of the situation at the embassy in Iceland, but the reason for the intervention is that the President is closely linked.
In addition to all this, Gunter is said to be motivated to follow the various rules of the foreign service and respect the authority.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to attend a conference in Washington, D.C., and is said to have refused to return to Iceland afterwards, leaving his temporary job for months at a time, in the midst of a global crisis.
Munter has even asked to be allowed to work in remote work and said he will not return to Iceland unless specifically requested by Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
According to the US State Department, Gunter had decided to take personal leave at the end of the conference and the coronavirus pandemic would further weaken his mind, but according to CBS, many within the ministry will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not do so until May, following Pompeo's contact with him and requesting that he please return to the embassy in Iceland.
The CBS coverage also reports Gunters's illness in Iceland, particularly in relation to the strain he calls the coronavirus the "Visible Chinese Virus" and has received much criticism.
Gunter is one of many, almost untrue, foreign service ambassadors appointed under US President Donald Trump.
Sachin Pilot vs. Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Party says there is a constitutional crisis in the state; Congress Party wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if this were necessary, the Congress would have to prepare for a presidential election outside the prime minister's home.
On Saturday, the day after a peaceful protest at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that if this were to happen, Congressmen would need to meet with the president and hold a presidential debate outside the prime minister's residence to bring the state's crisis to a close.
At a congressional meeting, Gehlot suggested that a vote be held to see if the majority of Congress and his allies would support him in the power struggle.
"He said the government has a majority and wants to go to the polls", Congress Party chief spokesman Mahesh Joshi said in a statement after the meeting.
The Congress was held at the hotel where the Gehlot supporters have been staying for the last few days.
The Secretary of State asked us to be prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the president and also hold a peaceful protest outside the prime minister's home", the party leader said.
Rajasthan's chief minister can convene parliament and have the Congress party show its majority, party leader Rahul Gandhi said on Friday, suggesting that the Bharatiya Janata Party's cabinet plan to oust Ashok Gehlot's government had been abandoned.
The country is now governed by laws and constitution.
Governments are formed and operate on behalf of the people.
There has been a rallying cry by Bharatiya Janata to topple the Rajasthan government.
This is a disappointment to the 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must convene Parliament to bring the truth to the country,' Gandhi said in a Hindi-language tone.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told Congressmen on Saturday that he was eager to attend a meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls the "Bharatiya Janata Party's" "prohibition of the vote-based declaration of confidence" does not happen.
Gehlot, who protested for hours at the Kalraj Mishra government residence on Friday to push for a parliamentary session, met with Congress and government members on Saturday and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by the government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to reschedule the parliamentary session, citing six objections.
The order will be sent to the governor shortly.
Gehlot has accused the government of interfering with the parliamentary session, as he is under pressure to intervene in the vote, which cuts confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, the Bharatiya Janata delegation headed by leader Satish Poonia and leader of the opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria met with the governor to discuss the state's COVID-19 situation.
Swallowed in a car just outside Borgarnes
A driver was in need of traffic when a car caught fire just above the golf course at Hamar, near Borgarnes, just before 4:00 p.m.
According to the Borgarnesi Fire Department, the fire was extinguished and is now expected to be removed.

Traffic was needed to be steered while the fire was still underway, but heavy traffic is in both directions.
Actress Spencer Grammer was given surgery outside a restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK  Actress Spencer Grammar reportedly tried to seduce a man when he cut her arm and stabbed her friend in the back outside a New York City restaurant on Friday.
Grammer, 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend would have done what everyone else would have done under the same circumstances and that they would have been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at a bar at the Black Ant in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood around 11:30 p.m.
On Friday, a man came up to them and demanded a receipt, but they were closing the restaurant.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to resolve a dispute between an unknown man and other visitors to the scene, police said.
The man fled the scene after injuring Grammer's right arm and stabbing her friend in the jaw with unknown drugs, police said.
No one has been arrested.
Grammer, who is the voice of Summer on the ABC Family series Rick and Morty and previously appeared on the ABC Family series Greek, is the daughter of Kelsey Grammer's star, Frazier, and Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both she and her friend had planned to get along quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal damage, she said.
In a statement to US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who had gathered on stage and the Bellevue Hospital staff for their support and remembered the incredible struggle of these workers during the coronavirus pandemic.
"It touched us to have the opportunity to thank them personally", Grammer said.
I don't want to be like McGregor and show off my money...
I'm here to help people  Chimaev after a historic night at UFC Fight Island  RT Sport News
Russian fighter Khamzat Chimaev is now named the next UFC star after signing up for Fight Island history, but he does not claim a policy of flagging his voice in a flagrant manner like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev led Northern Iranian RHIS McKee's team in their battle for the upper hand in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, winning his race after three minutes and nine seconds of first lap by getting his kick thrown into the floor.
The victory entered Chimaev's name in the UFC's history books for the interim period between victories in the modern history of the event, as only 10 days had passed since he defeated British John Phillips in a similarly decisive way, then in the middleweight division.
Chimaev, who has an 8-0 win percentage, received a $50,000 bonus for his performance against McKee tonight and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now known as Khalib 2.0, which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the similarities between Chimaev's performance and the UFC lightweight champion's birthplace in Tetonia, which is near the Dagestan hometown of Khabib.
Despite his newfound fame and financial gain, translator Chimaev has said he would not be willing to flag his audiences like MMA money maker Conor McGregor or his boxing counterpart Floyd Mayweather Jr.
I'm not just doing this for me, I'm doing this for everyone I can help.
I don't want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show off my money or anything like that.
I want to help people", Chimaev replied when asked at Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has also attracted the attention of fellow team member Conor McGregor and Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on social media that he could easily defeat Chimaev with a provocative move.
There was no poisoned reply from the warlord who goes by the name Borz, or wulf in his native Tibetan, who said that he would 'slaughter Danis with his eyes closed.'
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving there at age 19, may not give up on his financial means, but he is obviously unwilling to improve his fighting skills.
I can paint anyone who's...
How many fighters are in the heavyweight division?
I can paint them all, he said.
Give me a hundred and seventy-seven pounds of weight, and a hundred and forty-four pounds of weight, and I'll do both in one day.
Israelis continue to protest Prime Minister's response to the global crisis
JERUSALEM (AP)  Thousands of Israelis protested against the prime minister across the country on Saturday, the largest outside of Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem.
The protests have been going on for weeks, but they began because critics believe the government's negligence on the coronavirus response was a failure to contain the threat of the virus.
The corruption charges against Netanyahu have further undermined the protest.
"Bibi, go home", was the sign of the protestors.
The second sign read: "Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes".
Hundreds of protesters also gathered outside Netanyahu's beach house in the densely populated city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water cannons to split groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called a swift and disorderly economic recovery in May, the average number of new cases per day rose to 2000.
The country's economy has been hit hard by the virus's restrictions and unemployment has risen by nearly 20%.
Opponents say the government's financial support is almost inadequate.
The protest came in the wake of a court case over corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began this month.
The hearing starts in January.
He is charged with fraud, breach of trust and bribery in a series of corruption cases.
Hundreds of protesters gather in downtown Los Angeles to show solidarity with protesters in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA)  About 300 protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon in support of a two-month-old protest in Portland, Oregon, focusing on federal law enforcement after clashes with protesters.
Similar protests took place throughout the United States, including in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The Los Angeles protests were organized by the groups Refuse Fascism and the Youth Liberation Front.
The group joined the Los Angeles Police Department at First Street and Main Street, and then the Metropolitan Conservation Area.
The participants also crossed the Alameda Junction on Highway 101, but later left.
Some people saw broken windows in federal buildings in the city center and smudges were painted on federal signs.
At least one person was arrested during the protests.
50 people massed in mosques on Eid and no prayer gathering on Eidgah, Karnataka government says
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, falls on July 31 and August 1.
The Karnataka government has announced that only 50 can gather in mosques for prayer on Eid-ul-Azha, and has banned prayer gatherings on Eidgah and other places due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Guests wishing to pray in mosques must wear masks and keep their distance, according to the order of AB Ibrahim, the Minister of Minority Affairs and the Wakf.
The decree states that the Hilal Committee has decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also known as Bakrid, should be celebrated on July 31 in the kingdoms of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, but on August 1 elsewhere in the kingdom.
The decree states that while prayer gatherings are one of the most important Muslim holidays during the Bakrid festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be banned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in mosques provided that no more than 50 people attend at a time.
The ministry said that the number of hours of prayer should be increased.
No prayer meetings may be held anywhere else, such as meeting houses, community centers, or Shadi Mahal, as the case may be.
The Karnataka government has authorized temples, mosques and other places of worship to be open to those who wish to pray from June 8, provided that COVID-19 infectious agents are well adapted.
The U.S. Ambassador wants an armed lifeboat.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, considers his life threatened in Iceland and wants to be allowed to carry a weapon.
In early 2020, the US Embassy advertised the use of bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers and used the English word bodyguard in the ad.
According to the sources of the Kveiks, the main reason these jobs were announced is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter considers his life in Iceland threatened.
Kveikur has spoken to officials in Iceland and abroad who say the ambassador is convinced that he is in grave danger because he is of Jewish descent.
The threat is not clear, but Quebec reporters said Islamic terrorists had been listed as a threat.
CBS News reported on its website this morning, and according to Washington sources, Gunter is an extremist criminal, demanding to carry a weapon himself, a stung vest and armed escort, and a firearm.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has been implicated in saying that there is no threat and that the "bodyguard" ad is only for Gunter's own safety.
According to the Quebec sources, the positions had not been filled in June, but the application deadline was in February.
According to the Quebec sources, no official announcement has been made by the U.S. Embassy as a result of these changes.
No formal request for increased security or permission to move livestock armed outside the embassy walls has been made.
The Icelandic law states that such a thing is not permitted unless it is granted special permission by the State Attorney General.
Quebec's government officials say there is no information on any threat.
The State Attorney's latest threat is pretty definitive about terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence of terrorist or counterterrorism groups operating here.
The authorities authorising the use of foreign embassy guns in the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are not available, according to the Kveiks authorities.
Gunter brought considerable attention to the country when he shared the US presidential tribute and called COVID-19 the "Chinese virus".
With the style, he wore the American and Icelandic flags.
A Seattle radio broadcaster who insisted on Trump's reaction to the protests now claims to need a gun after a Starbucks coffee house under his apartment was destroyed  RT USA News
Paul Gallant has regained a new perspective on violent protests after accusing US President Donald Trump in June of saying anarchists were burning and looting the city of Seattle.
All that was needed was to be carried close to the home of the conductor.
"I feel like I need to buy a gun because this will obviously continue to happen", Gallant tweeted Saturday night after seeing entertainers have "proclaimed" the Starbucks cafe on the ground floor of his apartment building.
"I'm done. This looks like a street party down the street from me.
The reaction was so dramatic that Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
These liberal Democrats are glorious, the president said.
"The assassins burn and plunder our cities and they find it merely wonderful, even death".
Gallant, co-host of the season of "Danny & Gallant" on ESPN's Seattle affiliate, responded with a tip: "I went through there for a little bit of curiosity last night and saw no burns, robberies or deaths.
Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks coffee house.
He posted pictures of the damage and said, "Well done, half-wit", and he also noted that he had seen a fire in several halls.
I have no idea what's going on, but we're gonna find out.
The news didn't go unnoticed by people who claimed Gallant for his previous opinion and the kind messages on the board with "Just relax on laxatives" and "Yeah, maybe Trump was right".
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio host, said: "We're not going to end up on this tour we talked about.
Gallant went on to laugh: "I woke up and saw a pile of people cheering on my lax. I laughed".
He claimed to have faced his previous claim that he had gone through the CHAZ self-governing anarchist zone and although it is not as bad as it was portrayed as.
"So it was burning and stealing after all", he said. "It's normal".
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, in a house fight with her 28-year-old sweetheart, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together on the set of the show White Lines, about the sock and squirrel of Ibiza, but in the housing rush of the past week their other and quieter, distant party life was overshadowed.
A couple who play the brother in the popular Netflix series saw a beautiful rural Oxfordshire town for sale for £1.2 million.
They visited the Range Rover area as Laura, 34, a white-collared woman, and met a real estate agent who led them on a tour of the five-room house.
In White Lines, which was filmed in the late fall, Laura played Zoe Walker, who gets to know the dark side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her brother, the disc jockey Alex, played by Tom, 28.
Their relationship didn't come up until earlier this month, less than a year after Laura and Sam Claflin's six-year marriage ended, but he is known from the Hunger Games movies.
Together, they have a four-year-old son, Pip, and a two-year-old daughter, Margot.
When they announced their divorce last August, Claflin, 34, posted on Instagram: "Laura and I have decided to divorce. We understand each other in love, friendship and with a deeper respect, and we will continue our cooperation on raising our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 during an audition, and Sam, who also starred in Peaky Blinders, described their 2013 wedding as "arguably the biggest event of my life".
Before Laura landed her role in White Lines, she had previously appeared in the film Inbetweeners, and in the BBC crime drama The Capture, which aired last year, where she played the lawyer Hönnuh Roberts.
Tom took on roles in the second Inbetweeners film and the Sky series Brittania.
It's too early to say another wave is coming here on earth.
A specialist in the field of emergency medicine at the Office of the Chief of the General Medical Staff says it's too early to say anything about the second wave of the disease.
Three new domestic infections were detected yesterday in the Virology Department of the National Hospital and dozens have been registered.
Two cases of domestic violence were reported on Thursday, one in a man in his 30s and the other in a man in his 20s.
No infection had been reported since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more domestic airports were reported, including one that had been at the Rey Cup in Laugardal.
Johannes Johansson, the State Attorney General's Information Officer, told a news agency that fewer people had to go to the sample site because of the infection than originally thought.
The other case is a person who arrived from abroad on July 15.
By then, so-called home immigration laws had come into effect.
However, Kamilla Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of immunization at the Office of Agricultural Medicine, says that the applicant has gone back to the old method.
His symptoms were negative when he arrived, but he has since become ill, isolated, and six have been put in solitary confinement.
They're all on their way to a sample, but two of them are starting to show signs.
The third infection then relates to the elderly man who was diagnosed on Thursday and 12 have been placed on probation in connection with it.
The trip revealed a new variant of the coronavirus that has not been detected in this country.
We don't know exactly where this virus comes from, but we've never seen it before.
The person believed to have carried the virus to the country had been in Israel but also in other European countries.
It is too early to say that the so-called second wave of the epidemic has begun in a country like other European countries.
WHEN the majority is still viable, it is not feasible that it is.
But we're on the lookout, and we're watching, thinking about how we'd react if something like this happened.
Megan Fox discusses the relationship
Megan Fox says she found her twin soul in rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
As soon as I met him and looked him in the eye, I knew.
"I'm interested in astrology, and I knew at the same time that my twin soul was being discussed", says Fox, 34.
"The double soul is when the soul has reached a stage of existence that allows it to split into two different bodies at the same time", Fox explained.
So we're two halves of the same soul, I guess.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away.
After two days of meeting, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the signs of the stars and asked him about his life.
I decided to go deep right away.
Machine Gun Kelly is the same line as they met on the set of a movie.
I was hanging out outside her wheelchair, hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
It's only been two months since Fox announced her divorce from her husband of ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
The American musician, fashion model and presidential candidate Kanye West has apologized to his wife Kim Kardashian West for publicly making comments about family privacy.
"I want to apologize to my wife Kim for discussing private matters publicly", he tweeted last night.
There has been much speculation about the status of their relationship, but Kanye has recently made a big splash on social media and at a social gathering he held last Monday, including discussing the birth of his daughter North West, saying he almost killed her.
Then Kim stepped up on Wednesday and posted a message to her Instagram followers, discussing her husband's disability, who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously publicly spoken about her husband's illness, saying that it was due to their children's marriage and Kanye's right to privacy when it came to his health.

More racial rights protests in the United States
Protesters have taken to the streets of many cities across the United States to raise awareness of racial rights.
Protests have been going on for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent federal agents to Portland, and thereby still has a lot of opposition.
Opponents are now also protesting the presence of federal police in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used explosives and explosives and arrested 45 people after a protest rally in support of the Portland protests turned violent.
According to the police, more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gunman was pulled into the Black Lives Matter movement.
Media sources say the man may have walked up to a vehicle armed with a rifle before he was shot.
"At the heart of the matter is that it is terrible that someone should die in protests", Austin Mayor Steve Adler said in a statement.
Adler claimed to be harmed and speechless.
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with a permit to enter without bank, and shot her.
Taylor's lover had first shot the cops, thinking they were burglars.
One officer has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other officers have not been charged.
The NFAC, an armed group of black insurgents who have taken part in the protests, is calling for more transparency in the police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to police reports, three NFAC members were injured Saturday when gunfire broke out in a riot.
Possible group sickness in the sealing process
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infections this week outside of the border crossing.
Two of them were infected with a previously unseen variant of the virus, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be quite unclear.
It is not known whether the individuals were infected by a tourist who returned from the country or by an unidentified Icelandic who likely infected many more.
A leading expert in the field of immunology says that a possible group illness may be in the process of being sealed off in connection with one of the infections.
Two people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with the latest variant of the virus.
The source of the infection remains unclear.
Three cases were reported yesterday; one of them has been infected by another who was diagnosed on Thursday, another arrived on July 15 and was probably infected outside, while the third is also infected from an unknown source.
A series of genetic analysis by the Icelandic National Institute of Health revealed that the two individuals identified with the virus and associated with it have a new variant of the virus that has not been detected before in the country.
Kamilla Jöfsdóttir, an expert in the field of immunology at Agricultural and Alternative Medicine, says that the Icelandic gene research is now looking at the most likely origin of this type of virus.
Another case was similar to a virus that has been circulating in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They will look into this and try to map it better, leading to similarities as to which part of the world the infection comes from, she says.
It seems to be right here on the other side of the Atlantic.
So the two people who were brought to the United States in early July are not infected.
Do you assume that this new species has come out rather than have jumped in here?
"Well, this is different from what has been found here before, that there is really no chance that this was something that was being painted here", says Kamilla.
 There is also a good chance that these individuals have somehow come into contact with someone who is new to the outside world without their knowledge.
The investigation says that there is no indication yet as to where this new virus may have come from.
 There could naturally be a traveler who has left the country again, but there could also be someone who does not get symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected, and then there could naturally be more infections in the aftermath.
We'll be on the lookout for the next few days to watch it.
Anyone who's come has come up with nothing that's a smart group disease.
But there are people who went on hunger strike in connection with one of the infections yesterday who have symptoms and are about to go for a screening", says Kamilla.
We have not yet received any results from them.
So it could possibly be a group sickness in sealing.
Assume there's a community out there now?
It's not excluded.
It has not been recently, but it is not excluded because we do not know who carried the infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday.
Could we say that this is the beginning of a new wave of the virus?
No, not yet.
But naturally, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep that in mind, even though there are such definite limits to what we can do with a lot of people's samples.
We don't sample people with symptoms, but first, when we're getting an infection that seems to be untreatable, we need to be given a little more leeway by taking samples of people with symptoms, she says.
So the National Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases is expected to be in the sample in the coming days to try to map the station better in the country.
Does the state hospital have the capacity to increase the domestic sample and monitor the border?
Not unlimited, no. I know.
Therefore, there must be a basis for sampling of individuals who are not in the fertilization projects; the candidate must be in the test and show signs or symptoms and suspected of having had an affair with someone new to the country or something like that,' says Kamilla.
It notes that infections detected yesterday are still being detected and that extensive work is now underway to gather information on the travel of individuals.
It says the origin of the contaminants appears uncertain, but does not exclude the possibility that some of those now incinerated may provide clues that eventually lead the infection detection team to the original infections.
The restaurant that first knows but one of the best
Not everyone knows exactly where the restaurant is located, and of course it has more fans abroad than it does here on the ground, if you mention it on TripAdvisor and other sites.
Hearing of people who have flown to the country to visit him should come as no surprise.
Berglind Hreiðarddóttir, food blogger and cookbook author, rushed to Bjargarstein in the days and kept a steady stream of love
I don't know where to start because the restaurant Bjargarstein on Grundarvald is a pure, wonderful place.
The history of the house is one of the most brutal I know, the food at ten, the end of the story, and the wonderful entertainment of the servants!
Well, the owner of the Stone Mountain, he enchanted each animal's right to stand on each other's feet in front of us.
We sat down with our girls for an entire evening to eat, so it must have been a good meal", adds Berglind.
The building where the restaurant is located is an old apartment building that was completely moved to Grundarfjörð.
The current owners of this house for sale in Akranesi, found a beautiful sea on Grundarvaldi, and made their dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the Bjargarstein website.
The houses and surroundings of the Rock are unique.
The collection has been united by the whole family and it truly adds its flavor to the house.
On the top floor is a living room and really cozy and comfortable to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The street and the cuisine are not hidden, and knowing that much is being done to enchant delicious and beautiful food, Berglind says, noting that the pictures are not fake.
Sebastian Vettel joins Red Bull: F1 star says he joins Max Verstappen because of a team member
"This is a clear no, I'm afraid, and Sebastian is clear.
F1 will resume next weekend with two races running at Silverstone Road.
Lewis Hamilton can boost his lead after winning two of the first three Grands Prix since the sport's resurgence in the coronavirus era.

Mick Fleetwood's praise to Peter Green: "His music will live"
Mick Fleetwood paid tribute to Peter Green, co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was a founding member of this historic rock band along with the former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before reaching the height of her fame with her albums on board with Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that his music will live on.
"For me and all former and current members of Fleetwood Mac, it's a great moment to miss Peter Green", Fleetwood said in an interview with PA.
Peter was the man who formed the band Fleetwood Mac with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without paying deep respect to Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that music should shine cut and be moved by unpleasant passion.
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live", added the 73-year-old rock star.
Thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer all these years.
We were well off, and we made a very popular music channel that so many people have enjoyed.
"God be with you, my dear friend... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood".
The statement from Swan Turton's law firm confirmed Greens's face: "The family of Peters Green announces with great sadness that Peter passed away peacefully in his sleep this weekend.
More information will be published in the coming days.
Green leaves behind a daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, whom he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally named Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer.
However, the singer left the band in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac would receive much praise and worldwide popularity after several members joined the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on the albums Rumours and Tusk.
The Prince of Jehoiada is said to have remained steadfast
Prince Joakim, the younger son of Margaret of Denmark and Henry, the Danish prince, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he underwent surgery the day before for a brain hemorrhage.
According to a spokesman for the Danish Shepherd's Office, the 51-year-old prince is not yet in hospital, but he is in stable condition.
According to DR, the Prince's health is currently being investigated.
According to Dr. Peter Qvortrup Geisling, a health care specialist for DR, the effects of brain blood loss often do not occur until after surgery.
"It can range from unreal symptoms to hallucinations, memory problems, or difficulty in expression", says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait months to recover.
Prince Joakim of Dana, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and is also a patron of Monpezat, stayed at his family's vineyard, Château de Cayx, in southern France, when he fell ill on Friday evening.
He was first admitted to a hospital in the town of Cahors, a short distance from the farm, but then to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for a brain hemorrhage.
Google Pixel 4 can image the galaxy
The dual optical drive allows the Pixel 4's expansion to be seen in 3D, thus providing a better mode of viewing in the background with a face-to-face display than previous Pixel phones, which relied heavily on software to achieve these so-called bokeh effects.
To highlight the quality of the camera, Google invited legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz to speak on stage about her experience of taking photos with the Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.
Computer science is still at the forefront of all aspects of Google's new smartphone, and in this phone, computer-based photography is being used to improve HDR+ positioning by combining up to nine different images.
New two-dimensional image controls offer different options for printing and shading and allow users to anticipate HDR+ in real time.
The phone is also relying on robotics to offer better automatic whiteshot and improve the Night Sight night position, which is close enough to capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to the other camera features, the Pixel 4 Soli features a rat screen on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so users can release music, turn off timers, turn off alarms, or turn off the phone's sound by shaking their hands.
All Motion Sense calculations are done on the device instead of the Internet, and the same applies to the updated Google Assistant, where the computer now focuses on shortening response times and improving user privacy.
Google's continued focus on using its machine learning capabilities to its full potential has also spawned a new voice recording app that transcribes audio live without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available in English only, but more languages are expected.
The Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadia, a cloud-based gaming platform that will launch on November 19 in the United States, but a date for Australia is yet to be announced.
In addition to the new Pixel phones, Google also introduced the new Pixelbook Go Chromebook and the second generation of Google Pixel Buds headphones.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart headphones, expected next year, are completely wireless and feature a surround sound system that keeps tuning in to maximize clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart headphones are completely wireless and adjust the sound level to the sound around you.
Google also announced an update to its integrated Wi-Fi home network in the Nest WiFi line with a special directory along with many other base stations working together to improve wireless connectivity within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will take the name Nest, doubles the size of its predecessor and adds built-in speakers and speakers to use Google Assistant in every base station in your home.
It goes on sale in Australia on November 5 and costs A$399 for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but the new $79 Nest Mini adds sound quality by doubling the bass and has built-in wall mounting.
All Google mobile users will get a new call system feature for communication between devices at home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home with the Google Home app.
Final day of the league, Juventus can seal the win
Here's an overview of football in Europe on Sunday:
It's the last day of the season and a lot is still up: the Champions League and the Europa League, the last two bouts and the Golden Boot.
Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester lost the last two places in the Champions League to the eventual champions Liverpool and Manchester City, who are the runners-up.
One point separates the three teams, and Leicester take on United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenham are fighting for the Europa League.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth want to avoid the bottom two seats left by Norwich, which have already fallen.
With one game to go, Leicester's Jamie Vardy is the top scorer with 23 goals, two more than Southampton's Danny Ings and three more than Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
The play-offs for promotion to the Premier League will begin with Swansea taking on Brentford in their first qualifying match.
Fulham will play Cardiff in the final, which starts on Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich have already been promoted from the next division.
Juventus can achieve their goal by winning their ninth Serie A title, defeating Sampdoria.
By doing so, Bianconeri would be seven points behind Inter Milan, who are in second place with two games remaining.
On the other hand, Lecce must work in Bologna to build further hope of keeping himself from falling out of the league.
Lecce is four points behind Genoa, which is 17th, and one game ahead.
A barman saw a bottle of beer thrown at a bar in Devon.
A fisherman threw a bottle of beer into a bar when he interrupted the fishing line, according to a charity.
Pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay appear to show a man on a rock throwing things at an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey cell was hunting when the fisherman pulled out a bottle and threw it behind the animal.
Kenny called it "terrible and uncontrollable behavior".
He was said to have been picking up trash at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning with other people from the Seal Project, a sealing protection company, when he witnessed the attack.
"The cell tried to get into the hunting line", he said.
The fisherman then sipped the beer, squeezed the bottle, and threw it into the cellar.
The bottle fell behind the cell and he was drowning.
Kenni said that "it would be better if the cage were a strong animal" than if the seller simply did what he felt was normal.
"By throwing a glass bottle in it, you're stopping it from fishing", he said.
The Seal Project said this was not an isolated incident and that it had recently received numerous reports of this attack.
The company's Facebook post says its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage from the Hope's Nose collection on Sunday and that "several examples of antisocial behavior" have been seen.
All sailors enjoy the protection of the law on the protection of seals, and people are asked to stay away from them.
Rice from the Christmas tree in Laxca, Dölum
The first hundredth was wagered in Laxca, Dölum, today.
It was the work of Arnor Ißfjörd Guðmundsson.
He had put a Christmas tree in his back this morning and it was about two inches.
Afternoon, he enjoyed Christmas again and recalled a story he had heard about the spider taking the bait after the spider had been caught.
With that in mind, he took the Collie Dog's cock and threw over the Christmas ball.
He quickly got a jacket, and as he himself says.
After about five seconds, he was completely clean, and I realized this was the meter.
I was stressed because I had a 12-pound tail.
I usually catch fish, but I had this one for 40 minutes.
He was quite comfortable, actually.
I made a few trips up and down the pole, but then I got to the beach and it was a wonderful feeling.
He shouted his stick at me and jumped at him.
He was 102 centimetres tall and I doubled him", said a cat hunter at the Draandgili fishery in Laxá, Dölum, in an interview with Spordaakost.
Arnor is no beginner when it comes to a hundred points.
This was his eighth.
He caught such fish in Blond, Black, Hraunsfird, Kjarra, two in Langadals and one in the Eastern Range.
According to Arnor, the great fishing is in Laxca, in the Valley.
The crew that leaves tomorrow afternoon has 35 salmon, and our man has 18 of them.
Expecting a Flood Because of Design
Hanna, the first Atlantic hurricane of the year, made landfall in Texas, USA, last night.
Hannah quickly lost her strength and became a storm, but despite this, heavy rains have fallen in the area and large-scale floods are expected.
Up to 30 inches of rain is expected in one day, but in special places it could reach as much as 46 inches, according to the AP News Network.
In particular, there is a warning about the danger of sudden flooding caused by the storm.
The area where Hannah landed has been hit hard by the spread of the new coronavirus.
Moreover, the sea has made landfall and caused damage.
At least 43,700 people are now without power and a number of emergency services have been set up in the area.
President Donald Trump, speaking on the sidelines last night, said it was important for people to listen to experts and follow orders.
Below is a photo taken this morning by an AP news reporter.
Burning houses, shops looted, and infrastructure damaged
More than 60 people have been killed and 60 others injured in an attack in the village of Masteri in Darfur province of Sudan yesterday.
The attack was the latest in a series of serious security attacks in recent weeks, with homes burned, shops and markets looted and infrastructure damaged, according to a statement from the United Nations Humanitarian Office in the capital, Khartoum, today.
Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has announced that security forces will be deployed to the province's war zone to protect the population and the displaced.
Just two days ago, unknown forces in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in a second attack.
"The escalation of violence in various parts of Darfur province is leading to increased unrest, putting agriculture at risk and endangering people's lives and livelihoods", the United Nations says.
The occupation of Darfur, in western Sudan, began in 2003 when Arab-based insurgents rose up against the government in Khartoum.
While the government officials and Arab forces who tried to quell the uprising have been accused of widespread atrocities, some 300,000 have been killed in the fighting, according to the United Nations.
Omas al-Bashir, who was ousted as Sudan's leader, is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
While the new government in Sudan is now trying to negotiate peace with the main rebel groups.
Television reporter thanks viewers for watching the cancer thread
TAMPA, Florida (AP)  A television reporter in Florida thanked a viewer for noticing a lump on her neck and emailed her to have it examined.
Victoria Price, a reporter for the WFLA in Tampa, joined the board and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price tweeted that she's having surgery Monday to remove her vagina, thyroid gland and some toxins.
"The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we're hopeful that this will be my first and last action", she said.
The viewer emailed Price last month saying the knot reminded her of a knot she had.
Price, a 28-year-old investigative journalist, said this week that her TV station's slogan was 8 in your team.
"But the roles have recently been upgraded when the audience is with ME and I couldn't be more grateful", Price said.
I will forever be grateful to the woman who made sure to email me, a completely unknown woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did so nonetheless.
Talking about being with a guy on a team.
Part of the Jeronimo Open Space resort temporarily closed after two attacks by a werewolf
Two were bitten by slugs near the Oso Creek Trail on Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning, and the road had to be temporarily closed.
Laura Wittmer claims to see a bald girl almost every morning and usually tries to avoid them only, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bit her in the foot.
The corridor has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo City posted a message saying: "Today, two different sources reported that a sloth bit a human. Animal Services Mission Viejo is working on the case in cooperation with the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and part of the Jeronimo Open Space has been closed.
Wittmer tried to hit the werewolf with a water bottle.
She called the emergency line to get her car, but she could drive herself to the ER.
The wolf disappeared into the ward, but officials hope to be able to drive it and test it for dog food.
Wittmer will be receiving treatment for canine feeding as a precautionary measure for the next two weeks.
She said that this horrific event would not keep her from running in the morning, but that from now on, she would choose another place.
The condition of the person who was bitten is unclear.
Racist protesters meet with Seattle police
The Seattle riots on Sunday between police and anti-racial protesters resulted in numerous arrests, but there was public outcry over US President Donald Trump's plans to send a number of federal detectives into major cities.
Protests against racial hatred and police violence have erupted following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed gunman, in Minneapolis in May.
Protesters in Seattle fired on bicycle racing cars and broke windows in bicycle houses during Saturday's protests, prompting police to declare a state of emergency and fill the streets with pipe bombs and explosives.
Protesters also lit fire in wheelchairs on a construction site for a potential juvenile prison.
Police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 officers were injured.
A protest was held in support of the protests that are taking place in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump ordered highly controversial actions by federal prosecutors, in protest of local authorities saying the police are using improper force.
There have been demonstrations in Austin, Texas, as well as in Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha and Nebraska, Oakland and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one person was fatally shot in a mid-town gunfight on Saturday night, police said.
In parallel with the protests, Trump is waging an increasingly difficult re-election campaign in November, and has pursued a tough policy of law enforcement.
