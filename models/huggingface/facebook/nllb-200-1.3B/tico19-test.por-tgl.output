Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and UTIs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and especially intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves to a more serious illness, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve to a critical illness, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each EU/EEA country and the UK and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
COVID-19 has spread geographically after China, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of that country.

The March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases

This data was used to assess the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the cumulative number of cases reported for each country by 15 March 2020 at 8am, and compare with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those in Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
The Commission also noted that the EU/EEA and the UK have not been able to identify the specific cases of COVID-19 in the Union.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that as of 15 March at 8am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being in different stages, variations in national public health systems actions and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients who should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including testing for update.

Data on hospitalization for COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or a TIU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of IUD beds and SIDS beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100 000 people.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Since cases have hitherto been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and ICUs generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and ICUs should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts to ensure that the rules on the free movement of goods and services are complied with.
As highlighted in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have an outbreak of patients requiring intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms via a similar mechanism.

The virus has a great similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the respective disease was named as CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and spread quickly throughout the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.

WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 articles have been published about COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new rapidly developing area.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds.

Covid-19
As shown in Fig. Fig.1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
ntr'a-tempo,o epidemia se espalhou rapidamente para as cidades,províncias e países vizinhos.
On January 20, the contagion of healthcare workers was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.


On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.

e the situation is rapidly worsening, the final scale and severity of the epidemic has yet to be determined.

SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, mostly in the age group of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 was given an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time to death based on onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.

The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a unique RNA chain with a certain sense.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and membrane fusion occurs subsequently.
The genome of the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with over 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.

It has been found that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to human protein ECA2 weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of human full-length ECA2 at a resolution of 2,9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The originator and the intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both known to have originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camels respectively.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Though, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the species barrier and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be discovered.
Ji et al. suggest that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that pangolins, elongated-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.

The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are for the most part still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with 40% to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and 56 °C heat for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
Total, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.

We can therefore only consult previous studies on other CoVs, especially on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, once a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR), and RIG-I type receptor (RLR).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
SARS-CoV N protein, meanwhile, may help the virus escape the immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is joined to the virus fight.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the cells infected by the virus.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help in the defense of the cells.
CoVs, however, can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Immunity, including complementary antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and most often 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
THE COVER 
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not show symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus, generally need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Febrile is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, corneas, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis by lung imaging, should be screened for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster with transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
80% of patients needed ventilation support much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of higher mortality from MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) have also been observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilation support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.


For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.71 to 7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV varied from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and with SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Then it's a much bigger challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV.
The onset of symptoms in a group of people usually happens in the same family or in the same group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.


Patients have normal or reduced numbers of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscle and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and red cell sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Anomalies in chest X-rays are present in most COVID-19 patients, and show bilateral irregular shadows or opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases the surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the peeling of pneumocytes, formation of the hyaline membrane, infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
Reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.

On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter input) using a measuring rod in less than an hour, without the need for complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.

These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
e plasma from patients who have recovered has been suggested as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
epi, dysfunction and organ failure are the major threats to patients and the major causes of death.

Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary technique used for the treatment of severe heart or respiratory failure.
The first step is to identify the most commonly used antibody in the body.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytonin cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the targeted immune response to T cells; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab; suppressor of 4 cytokine signaling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
THE STERIOIDS
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of low to moderate dose corticosteroid treatment have been recommended for cautious use in severely ill COVID-19 patients.

Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended to treat illnesses caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Remdesivir has subsequently also been shown to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.

In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after lopinavir/ ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from cured patients and antibody generation

In fact, cured patients generally have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in a critical condition.
Her symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.


For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in a critical condition.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight an epidemic of global scale.

We can rapidly increase antibody production.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments in China.
though its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the TCM theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, achieved the lowest cure rate (13%).
t is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between Western medicine exclusive treatment and Western medicine combined treatment with TCM.
It was found that the time taken for body temperature to recover, for symptoms to disappear and for hospitalization were considerably shorter in the Western medicine and TCM treatment group than in the Western medicine treatment group alone.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the Western medicine and TCM group than for the Western medicine alone group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the Western medicine and TCM group than in the Western medicine alone group (8.8% vs. 39%).

Pasientes confirmados o sospechosos de COVID-19 generalmente tienen un gran miedo a la enfermedad altamente contagiosa que puede ser fatal, y las personas en cuarentena también se sienten aburridas, solas e irritadas.

In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, various psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, symptoms of psychosis, delusion, and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The Commission should also be able to monitor the implementation of the measures in place to ensure that the measures are implemented in a timely manner.
The European Commission has published a report on the use of vaccines in the fight against AIDS and other communicable diseases.

Vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
The in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and their lethal challenge models and protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before the start of a clinical trial.
This is probably because SARS has been gone for 17 years and no new cases have been reported since.
The Commission has also decided to extend the duration of the MERS outbreak to the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.

As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without any sequelae.
Though, just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.

Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Â Âge: Âge was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is most common in people aged 30-65, with 47.7% of patients being over 50 years old, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive treatment (average age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Heart attacks were the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ECA2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It's important to note that age and underlying illness are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also aid in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are present in a variety of organs, most notably the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So these are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for predicting outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants typically used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As a result of the widespread use of high-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Psychological stress:As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from elevated stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the deaths of loved ones and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counselling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from the characteristics of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 is also able to replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and causes no symptoms in the early stage of infection (or only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.

The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be empowered to adopt a decision on the implementation of the new rules.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.


The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the slowdown phase will last for 3 to 4 months.

Paul Hunter et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world's population.


It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause as many as a million cases, with half a million deaths.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2
also found in feces, which raises a new possibility: oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people in direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series No. 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being transported into the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects where they can infect other people.
THE N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation from 10 nm to 80 nm size viruses, with only 5% of viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particulates can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) but not surgical masks.

Virus also infect a person through their eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.


1 metre is considered a suitable distance to stay away from a patient.
These are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.

This message made people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containing the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was missed.
China's disease control agencies can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.

The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus started in late December 2019.
n 2 mεs, il sε pεrpaεntε pεr la Chine et pεr 50 lεtɑ̃s du monde, au moment où je sεtε écrire.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic has generated a sense of SARS coming back.
Though, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Pasientes con COVID-19 transmiten el virus cuando no presentan síntomas, mientras que los pacientes con SARS generalmente lo transmiten cuando están gravemente enfermos, lo que genera una mayor dificultad para contener la propagación de la COVID-19 que la de la SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA test may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.

Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, exactly how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Do the viruses also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and an effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or will it have a seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and many others.

zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.

The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put CoVs in the spotlight again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and its reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of great use.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are nonpathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
The study of animal CoV host interactions may also provide important information on human CoV pathogenesis.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is what we do to compare and contrast different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 disease epidemic is discussed in this context.
The requirements for efficient transition between hosts and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positive polarity and single-band RNA viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, have been called "CoVs" because of their crown morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open-reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different strains of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV, and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Fylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed the species barrier, and some have become relevant human pathogens.

Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the bark of common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
The concept that HCoVs infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating ever, infecting over 8,000 people, with a crude case-related mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed over 3,120 lives and infected over 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs are zoonotic in bats, mice or domestic animals.

The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and for the rest of the world.
The tracing of zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This may also guide and facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that parental HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the evolutionary trend of HCoV, where increasing transmissibility usually comes with decreasing pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.

In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
The HCoV-229E infected patients had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Then, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in lactating mice brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and tend to be predominantly transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
The incubation period of these two viruses is generally less than a week, with the disease being accompanied by about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have shown severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was reported in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of the "super-spreaders", it has been estimated that each infected person can infect approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
SARS-CoV infection patients initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by later symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Difuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophage number are also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20% to 30% of patients require at some point intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy from a relative of patient zero who was traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts are being devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of rickets, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring, and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.

In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide causing mild respiratory illness.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.

MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS, among HCoV-caused diseases.
Over 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.

From mid to late December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and has also named the disease COVID-19.

It is noted that the fatality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the fatality outside of that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also experience diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

SARS-CoV-2

SARS-CoV-2 and the other six HCoVs have been compared and contrasted and reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
The Commission has also assessed the impact of the measures on the environment and the environment, and has also assessed the impact of the measures on the environment and the environment.

Thirdly, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns in both community acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
The Commission has also assessed the potential for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to humans.
Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It has yet to be clarified in future studies whether or-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
The study also found that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in the United States than in other countries.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.

In other words, both could be survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
The HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans and people who develop severe illness from HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
The longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four Community acquired CoVs have been circulating in human populations for several years, causing the common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, as are community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a directly related ancestor, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic to that host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts HCoV continuously and durably.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
If HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host shortly before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
A HCoV may have infection stopped if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that SARS patient zero had a history of contact with game animals.
The Commission has also assessed the impact of the measures on the health and safety of the public and the environment.
Palma masked civets (Paguma larvata) and a hound dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no further SARS was reported following the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
The Commission also concluded that the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that various species of small mammals could serve as amplifying intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.

Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.

The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) in humans is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from bat fecal samples has been shown to use bat, civet and human ECA2 as a receptor for entry into cells.
It's intriguing that the serum from recovering SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.


The phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to the homologs in bat betaCoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
Till now, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
The study also found that the MERS-CoV virus is transmitted by the same virus to humans.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedaries, increasing evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
The results of the study were published in the journal Nature and the Journal of the European Society for the Study of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit the viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bats.
The Commission has also assessed the feasibility of the measures to combat the spread of MERS-CoV to the public and to the public.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat RaTG13 CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up between wild species sold and slaughtered at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, to which many of the early cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.

These new pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.

They cluster into sublineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In a huge contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology across the genome.
A recent study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of consensus viral sequences from lung samples which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different setup and manual curing methods to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We can't rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs.
The distinction between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also smaller than the distinction between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs of pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be elucidated.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betaCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 stems from selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
The first was the SARS-CoV-2 recombination of the betaCoV of SARS-CoV-2 related pangolins with RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is very much present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
Besides highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
The HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E viruses are the result of a genetic mutation in the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E viruses.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American Tricolor Bat was directly related to HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and camelids are also suspected to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs from bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them, there is an alphaCoV of alpacas.

First, humans, but not alpacas, can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related bat alphaCoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas the alpaca alphaCoVs caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alfaCoV has not been found in wild animals.
The possibility that alpacas may obtain HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans cannot therefore be excluded.
actually, bats are the direct source of viruses pathogenic to humans, including the rabies virus, the ebola virus, the nipah virus, and the hendra virus.

As an alternative, while alphaCoVs serve as the HCoV-229E gene pool, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has been corroborated by subsequent results.
Tseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Longevity, high density colonies, close social interaction and high flight capability are all favourable conditions for bats to be the ideal "virus spreaders".
The introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries, on the other hand, goes back decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and has migrated from an intermediate host to a natural, stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is a mild disease causer and has a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The sporadic transmission to humans is accidental, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.

Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
The Commission has also proposed that the use of the term 'transmission' should be limited to the use of the term 'transmission' in the context of the 'transmission' of SARS-CoV-2 to humans.
First, bats could be the reservoir host for a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2 related virus had been recently introduced.

It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
Besides the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating for CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
In comparison to other single-band RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered as 'moderate' to 'high' with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the adaptation phase of the CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with revision mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inoperability.
Remdesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
Though, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than their hosts.


Presumably, he has already adapted to another host that keeps contact with humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Teoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective.
Second, the large genome of RNA in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and protein functions encoded relative to the last three inches of the genome's end.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently swap models during RNA replication by means of a unique 'copy-choice' mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, tape exchange occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
Long highly homologous and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
The HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 have been found to be phylogenetically recombinant, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction with regard to transmission
Besides the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of SARS-CoVs from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the S protein DLR.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is selectively targeted by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is at 318o to 510o amino acids in S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize the ECA2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
SARS-CoV of civets has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electron cryomicroscopy indicates a 10 to 20 times greater affinity for this link than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other correceptor may be necessary for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It's intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
They could also account for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
The HCoVs are also known to be highly pathogenic and highly pathogenic.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host-dependent factors and subvert host-restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
The molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction have yet to be identified and characterised.
A non-biased screening with genome-wide reach of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
New HCoVs: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
The HCoVs are also known to be highly pathogenic and are known to cause severe infections.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion feature of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that epidemic MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different strains, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from the relief of selection pressure on viruses, such as the pressure on the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitor receptor and the low degree of expression of the class I molecules of the master histocompatibility complex.
The high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease revision, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains upon introduction into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic, or cause, at most, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without provoking a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of the severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine cascade, where the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was turned off from CoV replication.
The same immune response-switching strategy could have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Pangolin betaCoVs, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that either pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin betaCoVs may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.

CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception about the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human-to-human transmission.
The virus is transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs from pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been around in dromedaries for a long time.

They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.

To stop recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
n't we can eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The wildlife eating culture in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
nfact,manyviruses have been on the planet for a long time.
stay in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance for migration to another species.
Though bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 514/2012.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for people to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.

First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it's important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified the way it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Lastly, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.

It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for 'suspect case' and 'confirmed case' of COVID-19

2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant findings from research and experience in clinical practice; because of this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.

In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially termed as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your significant work and express our gratitude.

According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, one item of the epidemiological history elements must be combined with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three items of clinical manifestations must be met if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and nearby areas or in other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and nearby areas or from other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (greater than or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome exhibiting high homogeneity to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum testing; or any change in the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or increase in titer greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can notice that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples has been added to the second and third edition (of 18 and 22 January 2020 respectively).
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth editions (of 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
The changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which has increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
Plus, there's a growing body of evidence that reminds us to look out for atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Zhou et al. should be updated because it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in further studies and clinical practice.
To conclude, we await the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest you check and follow the latest guidelines from your home countries.
Our team will also update our guide to offer help.

17 fatalities have been recorded.
In an online news report, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.



transport of essential goods (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.


SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide

At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

United States has recorded over 244,000 cases of coronavirus, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were over 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Throughout the world, countries have announced tougher measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.

Woolworths also limited home delivery toilet paper purchases to one package per order.
This follows the previous four-pack per transaction restriction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that even with the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
"Shocked" sales last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
Costco in Camberra also limited the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made available in advance stock from a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to increase inventory, but that local board restrictions on frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
He expects high production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.


He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that when it is sold out, it leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if there were an abundance of shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [purchased] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap?
Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, maker of Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a report by News.com.au.
The real estate website domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to early auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers coming in on the extended Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin daily print, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.

Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.

We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic started by a coronavirus".
" And we've never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated that the outbreak "will get worse".

2019-20 pandemic of coronavirus is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate is estimated to be 4% in China, whereas globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from people and monitoring and isolating people with suspected infection.

The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic-induced shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.

Thanks to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.


The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has a close link to the bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with symptoms known to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019 and had no visible connections to the later group of seafood market.
Of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei Province, who may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new reported cases were decreasing in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially amongst people with milder symptoms.

The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.



The initial baseline reproduction number (R0) estimates for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without being tested, e.g. those who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.


The first death outside of China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on February 14.


The fatality rate represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with symptom onset between 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom onset after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who die due to a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die due to the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific infection population through case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the infection-lethal rate for the pandemic overall is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that looked at the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, of Pennsylvania State University, stated that "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
"

On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue to circulate for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University, stated: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it's highly transmissible" and "that it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the re-emergence will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and blue-colored face or lips. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a confirmed infected person be monitored and examined closely to rule out infection.
The Chinese estimate of the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of the uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.

It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, with close contact considered to be 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).

The droplets can land on the mouths and noses of people nearby or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in airborne spread.

Although there is concern that it may spread through the stool, the risk of this happening is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There have been positive tests for the disease up to three days before symptoms arose, suggesting that transmission is possible even before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of lab-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard and for up to four hours on copper.

There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.

It is believed to be zoonotic.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, at the whole genome level, to other bat-derived coronavirus samples (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the whole genome, so far, has found, at most, 92% sharing of genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. However, definitive confirmation is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on breath or blood samples.
results are usually available from a few hours to days.

As of 6 April 2020, none of these had been shown to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The peculiarities of X-ray and CT images of symptomatic persons include asymmetrical peripheral opacity in dark glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is putting together an online international database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although the imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for detecting characteristics of virus imaging with X-rays and CT scans.
strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper towel and putting this towel directly in a waste container.
It is recommended that anyone who has been infected wear a surgical mask in public.

The use of government location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.

Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash, which has proven ineffective.

CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum alcohol content of 60% when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
1%, isopropyl alcohol at 50100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5% and iodopovidone at 0,27,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location such as an office or a daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a paper towel when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discarding any towel.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of movement of exhalation droplets when talking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing masks can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene". It has also been recommended that masks be worn by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not touch their own face.

Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.

In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has required that everyone entering supermarkets must wear a face mask.
Israel has requested all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, has required passengers on inter-city trains and buses to wear face masks from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when outdoors. At the same time, it has been recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing down the transmission of disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.


The maximum number of people gathered recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face higher risk of serious illnesses and complications, with the CDC advising them to stay home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. In late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, i.e. virtually at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to implications that complete social isolation was needed rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspect they have been infected.
Agenciessanity have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.


The following conditions may apply:
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproduction rate below 1. Managing an infectious disease outbreak is partly about trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. We call this "flattening the epidemic curve".
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, face masks and self-quarantine; community measures targeting physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling events leading to congestion; community involvement to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. The most drastic measures to contain the outbreak were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. For example, entire cities were quarantined and travel bans imposed.

South Korea, for example, introduced mass screening and localized quarantines.
Singapore, where people who were infected were given financial support when they quarantined themselves, and those who didn't were given severe fines.

Ideal policies for reduction could reduce peak demand for health services by two-thirds and deaths by half, yet still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while also overburdening health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is circulation of the virus through the human population or until there is availability of a vaccine, if that happens earlier. Otherwise, transmission will occur again as soon as the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19. There are, however, efforts towards drug development, which include testing of existing drugs.
The use of nonprescription cold medicines, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting may help relieve symptoms.
depending on the severity of the case, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection or respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.

The World Health Organization also stated that some "homemade and traditional" medicines can relieve the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes capacity building and adapting health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Europe office have issued guidance for hospitals and primary health care services to shift resources at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-mandatory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive COVID-19 test results, as well as increased intensive care capacities through staff training and increased available beds and ventilators.

The first known case of the novel coronavirus was on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.

Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26th. Her hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center on December 27th.


WHO was informed the same day.
When these reports occurred, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.

The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply shortages, stemming from the increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-motivated purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The United States Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier disruptions.

The technology industry in particular has been warning about delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has gone up 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would put workers' health at risk.

Laboratory tests for the respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
Used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Tests for antibodies reveal how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who remained asymptomatic.
A precise disease mortality rate and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.


This variability is likely to still have a substantial impact on the mortality rates of the cases recorded, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test may be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR test performed with a swab of the pharynx is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Then, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, material from the samples may be removed from the airway bed by suction catheter or material expelled by expectoration (secretion) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for its PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative real-time RT-PCR diagnostic dashboard for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories by Reagent Resource International.
One of the three genetic tests in earlier versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests for faulty reagents and a test bottleneck at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.

The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the RT-PCR-based test for COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics has also made testing for COVID-19 nationally available as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a US FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test that uses isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.

A March 2020 literature review concluded that "chest X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT findings may be present even before symptoms emerge".
The typical characteristics in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in opaque glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".[]
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in individuals who started 7 days or shortly after symptoms arose, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or by remote laboratory testing (PoCTs).
The high-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required prior to testing.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA with an authorization for emergency use.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and hence much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
The UK has a long history of antibody testing, and has been known to use antibody testing in the past.
Hong Kong has set up a system where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel saliva in the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS has announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In drive-thru testing for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking the appropriate precautions.

Different testing methods targeting different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centres for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in testing made available to the US and China and the US faced problems with the reliability of test kits at the very beginning of the outbreak, furthermore, these countries along with Australia failed to provide enough kits to meet demand and recommendations for testing made by health professionals.

The testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their testing kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC showed "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results could be the result of a sampling failure or incorrect use of the kits.
The Minister of Spain stated that he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were considered to be inaccurate.

The testing, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had come into contact, had positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two stages of testing the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were quarantined.
With movement to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.

one statistical study identified that countries that did more testing, relative to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are better able to detect those with no or few symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column 'Positive in % of tests' is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that only tests people in hospitals will have a higher % of positive tests than a country that tested all its citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.

The main purpose of washing hands is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.

and lowering the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study revealed that better hand washing practices can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years old.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
Then you can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to areas in need.
48%
Pneumonia, the leading IRA, is the number one cause of death among children under five, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, making washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet a long-standing habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.

There are five crucial times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child's butt (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.


A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States near the average with 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate with 23 percent. Various methods for behavior change currently exist to increase acceptance of handwashing at critical times. Mass handwashing for children in schools at certain times of the day is an alternative in developing countries to inculcate handwashing in children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.


The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and increase the solubility.

cleanup is facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria accumulated from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have looked at bacterial transmission from a contaminated soap bar have concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosing controls is preferred".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely publicized to the health conscious public.

However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are advertised.

Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on your hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic water-based hand sanitizer (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) are starting to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activityHand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.Hydrogen peroxide is also effective in killing germs.Hydrogen peroxide is also effective in killing germs.Hydrogen peroxide is also effective in killing germs.Hydrogen peroxide is also effective in killing germs.Hydrogen peroxide is also effective in killing germs.Hydrogen peroxide is also effective in killing germs.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost totally ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick extermination action against micro-organisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause dryness of the skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of the alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and dryness on the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis has become an attractive comparison to washing hands with soap and water.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions on the skin.

Ash or dirt may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinsing your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended to use running water as fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rubbing your hands with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rins well with running water.
Lavar en una fregadera puede volver a contaminar las manos.
Towel dry or let dry in the open air.
Wet or damp hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most commonly neglected areas are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Prints and enamels can harbor microorganisms.


A makeshift faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water into your hands and a bar of soap.


In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by towel paper, heated air hand dryers and the latest air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to be, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
air-jet dryer caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, by 42% in the palm area near the fingers and by about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at rated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms to within 0.25 metres of the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Washing your hands with wet hand wipes is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.

There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
one study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Clinical handwashing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the fingers entwined.

After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being re-contaminated by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guideline of the organisation can also be found on this website for comments.
A relevant review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstrated regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
following exposure to body fluids/blood

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of hands and forearms to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not required.

After the hand washing is completed, the hands are wiped with a sterilized towel and the surgical robe is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit from hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a slight additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.

There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.


For example, in most of rural Africa, hand washing faucets near any public or private toilets are rare, although there are cheap options for building hand washing stations.

The promotion and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing and provoke a long-term behaviour change in the population.
To make this work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low and middle income countries, whereas social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example for promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the maximum three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be a part of handwashing promotional campaigns carried out with the aim of reducing childhood disease and mortality.

few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit relationship of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY classification.

The importance of hand washing for human health especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two forerunners of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
Back then, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have sparked a growing awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, signs with "techniques for proper hand washing" have been hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and in office building toilets and airports in Germany.
"Washing your hands" means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or to be conniving with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase of more general use in some English communities.

It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to place more importance on hand washing equipment.


Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow washing hands after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow washing hands before and after meals.

The appropriate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and the workplace itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label, and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.

This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public such as in schools, high population density workplaces, and in the high volume retail market.
The danger controls for this group, in addition to the basic infection prevention measures include ventilation with the use of high efficiency air filters, protective covers and the provision of personal protective equipment in case a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that healthcare and morgue workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk for exposure, which increases the risk for very high exposure if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens of these people.

The COVID-19 epidemic can have various effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are sick, because they have to care for other people, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.

Finally, the shipment of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be halted. An infectious disease action and preparedness plan may be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising in the home and community, and individual worker risk factors such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and action plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission between employees, protecting people who are at highest risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in the supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to improve the safety of workers in the workplace.

The European Commission has published a report on the impact of the EU's action on the environment and the environment.
All PPE types should be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as needed (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to avoid contamination.
According to the US Department of Health and Safety (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick and using respiratory tag including covering sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for napkins and common garbage, preparing for teleworking or staggered shifts if necessary, discouraging the use of tools and equipment by other workers and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a key step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or alleviate other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that they be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission in the location of the business, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail stores. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygiene bulkheads, and installing a drive-thru window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include encouraging workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, establishing staggered shifts, canceling non-essential meetings for COVID-19 epidemics, developing communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' needs, providing training on the use of hand-held devices and other protective equipment, providing workers with access to the workplace, providing training on the use of hands-on protective equipment, and providing workers with access to the workplace, and providing them with the tools and tools necessary to protect themselves from COVID-19, including the use of hands-on training, providing training and other tools that are in place to protect workers from exposure to COVID-19, and providing the public with the necessary tools and equipment to protect themselves from the risks of exposure.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from other people for a distance of 6 feet, with a crew member being assigned to serve the sick person and offering a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include delaying the journey by the sick passenger, self-isolation and immediate reporting to the on-board medical centre if anyone develops a fever or other symptoms during the journey.
CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection for schools and child care centers if an infected person has been present in the building, regardless of whether the virus has spread in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical education or choral classes, or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between tables, stricter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and use of a separate health care location for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school absences may be considered.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed illness follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before reuse using a common household spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and morgue workers to be in high or very high risk exposure categories.

The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or handle specimens of such patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.

Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some necrotrium and healthcare scenarios.
Specimens must be handled with biosecurity level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two separate waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. Besides other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working within 6 feet of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 particulate filter facial respirators or higher quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment testing, training and medical examinations.
OMS do not recommend wearing masks since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective eyewear or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves for professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol generation procedures.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.

We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our global human interconnection and our responsibilities towards each other clear.
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
The companionship and concern we've seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings we've had the privilege to work with.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you as my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is that this essential resource remains online and available to everyone.
work makes this possible, because you keep the workplaces active, pay our coworkers and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
t is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
eÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
at this meeting, we discussed what we thought was an appropriate action for what we are experiencing and how best to keep the organisation sustainable in this period.
want to reduce stress and support our mission for the long term.
if you need to take a break for a while, that's fine.
For all staff, service providers and contract workers:
our working hours will be 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until we are told otherwise.
t is not a holiday, so if you can work normal hours, you might be useful to our mission.
though, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, buy groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
e rule wouldn't even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
You don't need a certificate or paid leave. Just ask your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are being met.
(️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

We've said this before, and we're committing to honoring our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
everyone will get their wages based on their normal work record under normal circumstances.

if you want to work, we give you our full support.

The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
remembering that your well-being is more important.
tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttT
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities we should continue to perform.
The Sites Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising teams (among others) carry out key activities that may require additional support.
We'll begin a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, and we're gonna focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Today's slowdown won't hurt us in the future.
We don't intend to "work double time to make up for lost time" once the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What about the Annual Plan?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension to our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and for employees to prioritize essential work, personal care and caring for loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced commute in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces the current planning workloads and the pressure on the entire organisation.
We'll be presenting our proposal to the board next week and we'll update the representatives and the teams on the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleanliness of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our coworkers from San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
eimber of this situation, as a precaution, we've employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all the surfaces, as well as the lobby and all the elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own duty of care protocol using products that are safe for its attendees.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington employees.
last week, our Washington office moved to a totally remote setup, in line with the shared guide with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
THE CASE: These discussions are ongoing, but they may be delayed.
some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know it can be a fit, and they'd like to offer some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into several days.
Set up the meeting, have a schedule, and send in advance reading materials.
Use video as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make collaboration and connection easier in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate the meetings, someone to monitor the chat questions and the list of participants, and someone to help take notes (or collaborative notes).
Email support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in the increase of remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel Wikimedia funded public events, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We warned them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions might make it impossible for them to complete their agreed-upon grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
next week, we'll continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the global community seems to be sadness over the paralysis, but also relief over the clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and in other situations.

Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug targeted for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also functions as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal domain that is a transporter of amino acids and colectrin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein with its enzyme-active domain exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to the ECA.
ACE clears the type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxymino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradicinine, apilin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
The S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 binds to the ECA2 enzyme domain on the cell surface resulting in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme in endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with the inhibitor pattern of ACE and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".

The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is believed that human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and it has appeared to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.

Australia and New Zealand are planning apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to implement a geo-delimitation app for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential for ineffectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to only a small fraction of the population.

Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.

Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organisations stated eight conditions for the government projects:
the surveillance should be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
the extension of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the aggravation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;

The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
Israel has approved network-based tracking.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy preserving systems have been created to use central servers for intercommunication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.

Besides using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to the sweeping changes to information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.

PEPP-PT is a coordination effort covering centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personal identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for using privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location or cross-roads data to track the spread of COVID-19.

The targets of the largest platforms that have advanced to the Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (stage I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and candidate for vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)

A phase I-II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing disease, while also monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet had an evaluation in humans (still in preclinical research).

On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that elicited potent antibody responses specific to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident to have started 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

A later randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.

Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in non-human animals.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there has been one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).

The patents cited by various social media posts indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as the SARS Coronavirus.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of the Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but can vary from 2 to 14 days.
Though most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.

568,000 have been cured. The virus is spread between people mostly through direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Though these droplets are produced when exhaling, they usually fall to the ground or stay on surfaces rather than staying infectious over long distances.

Viruseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people who suspect the virus and for people responsible for their care.


local transmission has been recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, blue face or lips.
Less commonly, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially had only tightness in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not everyone who is infected will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatic agents play in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China National Health Commission started including asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The saliva and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talk out loud releases more droplets than normal talk.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach 15 feet (4.5 m).

Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolled and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through feces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, it is usually one person who infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on surfaces.
Especially, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivating it and eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day tested.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel novel coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.

The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been observed in 12% of infected people who have been hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disturbances during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients in the ITU with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.

Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard testing method is polymerase chain reaction via real time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however a nasal swab or catarrh sample may be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
blood tests can be used, but this requires taking two blood samples two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.

As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) was in development, but has not yet been widely used.
The Chinese have shown in their testing experience that their accuracy is 60 to 70%.
FDA of the United States approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar opaque glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thick lobular septs with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There are few available data regarding the microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4 types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
: pneumonia: edema pulmonare, iperplasia dei polmoni, polmoni grandi atipici, infiammazione interstiziale con infiltrazione linfocitica e formazione di giganti multinucleati
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukocyte erythroblast reaction

CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when you cough or sneeze, as well as covering your mouth with the inside of your elbow if the handkerchief is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public gatherings.

In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is via ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated by means of palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.

US intensive care and pulmonology have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
To minimize the risks of virus transmission, precautions must be taken, especially in the healthcare environment, when procedures that can generate aerosols are being performed, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with airborne infection isolation (AIIS) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. The CDC summarizes guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: an EPI blanket, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for uses not described.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure in two levels.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Some doctors prefer to stick with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the aerosol particles from spreading, when compared to the high flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 and especially over 80 years old).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
one study in China noted that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.

The use of a high-PEEP pressure control mode is necessary to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injury associated with ventilation.
High PEEP may not be available in older fans.
Research for potential treatments started in January 2020 and clinical trials are being done with various antiviral medicines.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.

Antiviral medicine can be tested on people with various diseases.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in the testing of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has given temporary authorization for the use of plasma from convalescent people as a treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies needed to show its safety and efficacy against the disease have not yet been conducted.

The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Back in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect whoever is violating the quarantine.
Giulio Gallera, Commissario Regionale della Salute Italiana, ha detto di essere informato dalle compagnie di telefonia che "il 40% delle persone continua a circolare comunque".
The German government ran a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with over 42,000 participants.

Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress, and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to damage people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold.

In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19 associated with complications include sepsis, clotting disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
The study also found that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the United States was higher than that of other countries.

According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of 6 to 41 days.

Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung scan looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
11.8%
According to data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations had pre-existing comorbidities.
The estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences but also due to methodological difficulties.
underreporting of mild cases may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.

Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to nonsmokers. Concerns were raised about long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital authorities have seen a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people who have recovered from the disease, and lung tests have indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to post-ICU syndrome after recovery.

Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive testing for coronavirus at a later date.
It is believed that these cases are the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origins, through overflow infection.

A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.


This varies by region and over time and is influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.

Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case-fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection-fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Though not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
Gangelt,
t is not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have had death from COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
mortality is higher in men in studies done in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of female smokers and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.

Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A greater percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is for "corona", "VI" is for "virus", "D" is for disease and "19" is for when the outbreak was identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".

In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and " 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease" as interim names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidance against using place names in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material, such as nasopharyngeal swabs and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a respirator valve urgently, and the supplier was unable to deliver on time, a local startup reverse engineered and printed the 100 needed valves overnight.

The study was unable to find any evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.

In March, the World Health Organization started the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with most likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.

There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactive or dead, is aimed at provoking a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).

The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.

A dynamic review of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There's been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which is already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.

Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, though recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after having demonstrated low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the initial spike protein in preparation by serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies.
Cytone storm may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-like anti-seizure properties. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China following the completion of a small study.
A non-randomized phase 2 trial is ongoing at national level in Italy, having shown positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is hoped to counteract these developments, which are thought to be the cause of death for some affected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for SRC.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy may mediate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
