The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's reelection
Republican leaders have justified their policies by the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center calls such fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Republican lawyers, by the way, have only documented 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in the last decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, in the United States, the responsibility for organizing federal elections lies with the individual states.
And in that spirit, most U.S. governments since 2009 have enacted new laws that make it harder to vote or register.
This phenomenon has seen a surge since the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights were introduced in 41 states in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
The law also limits the period for early elections, invalidates the right to register on the electoral roll on election day and deprives citizens with criminal records of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to provide a photo ID.
The first state to make this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian Act was upheld in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Republican officials rushed to expand the practice to other states.
In the past two years, 34 states have proposed similar laws to force voters to provide photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, some five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an ID.
In addition, the required ID often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their preference for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their school-issued photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer to vote for Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs in the election.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship in elections.
Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It is worth noting that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 backed laws in eight states that would cancel voter registration on Election Day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register some 10 million people.
However, measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decrease in the number of new voters registered in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states passed legislation aimed at shortening the time frame for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African Americans made up 33% of early voters, even though African American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting early.
On the other hand, whites, who made up 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of early voters.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been very strongly opposed to passing laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors have vetoed several bills.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the United States Attorney General even intervened.
They've partially contained the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced will make it undeniably more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics have mainly pointed to the bias of the passed laws and see them as a clear attempt to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain already today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: should I get tested or not?
The PSA test often produced erroneous results that were false-negative or even false-positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this only increased the hesitancy of the men, who were already reluctant to go for the test at all.
Do you want to get tested or not?
We've asked two experts for their opinions.
Studies in the USA have shown high levels of contamination between individual test groups, making it difficult to interpret these results and make any useful recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different mortality rate between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed that after a 12-year gap, those who did not get tested had a 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend screening at age 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative with prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and there are non-aggressive cancers.
It is therefore essential to explain the risk of the cancer to the patient correctly, to offer possible alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which does not necessarily have a long-term impact on life, and to focus on active surveillance in these cases.
Today, many men diagnosed with cancer do not seek treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and life-threatening.
Rather, we suggest that they be actively monitored and treated if the disease progresses.
Increasingly, we are setting out criteria that help us to decide which species to treat and which not.
I recommend you get tested, though.
The important thing is to talk to your doctor and decide whether you should have a physical exam.
Movember, in collaboration with the International Urological Society, has developed a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and exercised enough, up to 30 percent of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone quit smoking, the number would rise to at least 50 percent", points out André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Foundation.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
There is also a percentage that remains completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Research Foundation continues to make smoking a priority, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They're also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouragingly, 10 years after a smoker stops, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
Weight
Obesity and obesity are another risk factor for the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer", adds the report.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
If consumed in excess, it may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid the use of the same ingredients.
Preserving meat by steaming, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage cells and lead to cancer", the report adds.
Other, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, studies have not yet reached clear conclusions.
According to the SCC, the studies on vitamin E are conflicting.
While one study suggests a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another study suggests an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been conclusively proven.
Mr. Beaulieu also insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Getting tested doesn't mean you're gonna get cancer".
The Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There's a theory that this boson is involved in the mechanism that's responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And then there's the last particle that the Standard Model predicts -- our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but that has not been empirically observed.
But there's still no certainty among physicists that it's the Higgs boson.
There's no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the Standard Model.
New data released this week at the major physics congress in Kyoto is more like a confirmation, but we still don't have all the data to be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume it's the Higgs boson, since the risk of error seems small, and let's see what it actually is.
There is an undeniable law in this world that no two things can happen at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
He further divides the physical particles into two categories.
On one side, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow Pauli's principle.
And at the other end of the spectrum are bosons, mean anarchists who don't value anything -- certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups by the device (which is absolutely amazing, by the way) called The Particle Adventure, at Berkeley Labs: mesons, which we'll leave out of the picture here, and "force particles", which are the forces of nature that are spreading and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
But it has to be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you're reading this, it's because of a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is a "carrier" of the electromagnetic force.
When charged particles accelerate or change direction, they "disrupt" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, the "carriers of the force".
More stable field
It's the same with the Higgs boson, except that you have to "disrupt" another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it needs to be excited at very high energy levels, much like the frozen surface of a pond, which is just a very large boulder yesterday.
For this reason, it is necessary to use a particle accelerator as huge as the one at CERN - a large hadron accelerator with a cluster of clusters is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to clarify the relationship between the Higgs boson and matter.
Not all particles or all materials react with an electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself apart on a refrigerator.
And also, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have some mass, while others (like the photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what is all this research for, what will it "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, it is a validation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and SM predictions.
And a lot of physicists literally wish they could find them, because the slightest difference could open up space for "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It must be noted that the model still has huge flaws, providing no explanation for gravity (wow!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's mass (wow!)
But CERN has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Reactions
The impact of these findings on Mr. and Mrs. Novak's daily lives is difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
See, in the very early 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would spark.
They're supposed to have scientific applications, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle -- who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first stationary laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I've already said that -- the laser was initially considered a "laboratory toy".
Just think about it.
And, moreover, applications can also come from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle invented a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, though not at all what Boyle originally planned, now serves as the eye of all the digital cameras in the world, and it won him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
Of course, that doesn't mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to leave your life...
Through its Commission on Dying with Dignity, Quebec recently engaged in a sensitive issue regarding the end of life.
The debate is expected to continue shortly and a bill is also being prepared.
There is still much work to be done in this vital area.
Le Devoir magazine has tried to look at this question in more detail.
Not quite a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer that was eating him up gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years to live, and now it's seven", he says emotionally in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for that", he adds.
The disease has done its work: the extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet or even eat by himself.
He resignedly looks at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help himself to his meal.
He's brave and even smiling, talking to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage to die a simple death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of this diarrhea, which humiliates me", he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"You learn all your life that men urinate standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Going back to the baby phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the individual's ability" to accept the return, says the psychologist.
According to many palliative care practitioners, the key moments are at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois hospice are all cancer patients.
Their prognosis is three months to life at most.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "of asphyxiation while fully conscious".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children", he adds.
"I have no wishes in life anymore", she says, and then she allows us to put her on a ventilator.
Yet, in the days ahead, he is still looking forward to his son's final visit from Italy.
The Victor-Gadbois Home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, provides nutritionally-assisted body care.
This is what palliative care looks like, which comes in when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little when you realize we all die one day.
Here, life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he may be given a sip of brandy or pepsi, as he likes.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
Last night, they brought beer to Mr. X. He died later that night.
This morning, his son is finishing his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, days go by, but they don't look alike.
Next to a 93 year old man who rejoices at the last reunion with his family, laid out on pillows, as they toast his memory, a 36 year old man dies tragically surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying every option to survive.
"Six months of the year, there are always three to five beds reserved for people with cancer under 45", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering once a patient reaches the end of their life, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec that is causing many palliative care doctors to fear the passage of euthanasia and assisted suicide legislation.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating signed by the leaders of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be approved.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in excruciating pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He's worried that patients won't ask to be put to death because they're not getting proper care.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last minute, regardless of the prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she abandoned the grueling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she said that she regretted not fighting, she tells us.
And she was telling me it was over!
There is no all-powerful cure
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not granting their wishes when the palliative care team relieved their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives to put the patient to sleep until death, either by shock or by continuous sedation.
We can't pretend not to notice this part of suffering.
A patient who doesn't get pain relief will have an increasingly greater chance of access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want you to take away my pain".
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works contractors, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts keep telling what they know about the amazing "system" that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, unions, and mafias.
This "giant" came at a great cost to Quebec taxpayers, particularly between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has fallen apart since we took the drastic measures", says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec legislator and former police chief in Montreal, ironically.
In 2011, he sparked a scandal following a thorough investigation into embezzlement of funds in connection with Quebec's road construction contracts, which were approved after lengthy delays by then-Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of government officials.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010", he says, "the Department of Transportation alone has saved a billion dollars in procurement costs" when some people kept their instincts in check to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dismissed two mayors", he adds, hoping to "unmask the cunning of some people".
Permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in the fight with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
And the police of the "Marteau gang" who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "money cartel" significantly reduced the inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, they've conducted a series of raids and charged with fraud and corruption a number of city councillors, including Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban community.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He's suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public procurement.
Formal charges have also been filed against Montreal transportation engineers and Italian-born businessmen, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal to a mafia-linked broker who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was running.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000, donating more than C$88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to the Liberals, who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Money-line contracts overpriced
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described him to the committee in great detail: Over a period of ten years, he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and pocket money from construction companies totaling $736,000 in exchange for overpriced pipeline contracts.
Other public transport officials admitted to having received remuneration for overcharging invoices by 30% to 40% through false duplication.
Mayor's party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of blushing his eyes at a concurrent budget that was bringing dirty money into his coffers.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of a municipal property bought for $5 million and sold for... $1.6 million to developers right in the middle of a booming real estate market.
70% of the dirty money in the election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually begin, he says, he is "pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the system promoted by the ants to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
She says the process is "painful but positive".
We're in the process of cleaning up the wound, but it's important to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure oversight so these questionable practices don't happen again.
Like when she's cleaning.
I'm going regular.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "the deputies informed of this deception" if they have not soaked in these holes!
He estimates that 70% of Quebec's campaign financing comes from dirty money, and he ironically adds: "I've heard it's just a faint decoction of reality".
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to $100, but he says that will not solve the situation: "Until campaign spending is strictly curtailed, dirty money will not disappear from politics".
It proposes comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party funding: "We can't go any lower; if we face the facts boldly, we can build again on a stronger foundation and with more control and compliance".
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that all who mock him look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, with PSG, you have set a new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It could be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other, or by a whole new dimension of PSG.
We got some big players coming in.
I'm getting closer to them every day.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the bar.
And it's easier in the games.
Football is a fast game.
I'm not losing my mind.
From my beginnings in training at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always moved up through the ranks.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti has created...
This summer's reinforcements are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is crucial.
And it means that a player like me has more desire to play and want to perform at their best.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of credit for my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And Ancelotti has the final say at the right moment?
Of course I did.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he is second to none in the Premier League and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience and won a lot of titles with top teams.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
I had a reassuring conversation with him in January.
I've had a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
Lyon has taken the lead in the first division.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we've made it to the last eight very easily.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group against Porto first so we can play the revenge eighth round at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He's got the budget for it.
If Paris wants to become a great European club, they have to win titles and go down in history.
Not today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
And would it be a big failure not to win the league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had a chance to win.
We had a great season.
We got 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think we'll do it this year.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are competing for the title, I think we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something to blame us for in the papers, it's not exactly pleasant.
You ask, what more can people want from you?
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game plan.
You need time to build a team.
We proved we can play in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, who have not made it to the last eight for the second season running, and they've also invested a lot of money!
Given the amounts invested, you'd be expected to have a 15-point lead over the others!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, who had not done so well last season, have moved on to the next phase with the new PSG.
That just goes to show how great the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
It seems PSG is relying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances in everything.
It's good to hear that there's a "Zlatan addiction".
It means Ibrahimovic is very efficient and he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he's here, proving he's a major league star.
Everywhere he went, he proved he was a great player, a world star.
We respect the man and the player on our team.
He respects the people around him, too.
What he's accomplished is truly extraordinary.
This led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How was Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing as I imagined.
But I've been through it and I've come out stronger.
I'm doing well on the national team today.
And I've been hoping for that since I joined the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to be exemplary in our actions.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps' first few months in charge of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We're in a good spot in the World Cup qualifiers.
Coach is strict, he's close to the players, and he can get excited about winning.
Laurent Blanc was like that.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the 1-1 draw in Spain on October 16 a solid opening match?
This fight has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
I've never seen a match like this before the shock in Spain.
Bitcoin allows you to pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current central bank-based financial transactions, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
And as is often true with these technologies, there is an obvious political perspective: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both virtual money (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent that allows the exchange of files between two partners.
With 15 000 computers connected to the network, some 200 000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin first peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, and is now hovering around $10 (see bitcoincharts.com for price summaries).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual money", "competing the dollar and the euro" and "an analogue of regular money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like "credits" used to progress in a video game, which a person gains in the game or which they can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social networking site Facebook has developed a similar system.
However, each month the Central Authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are current account depositors, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses via email.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The information set related to this transaction shall be electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the validity of the transaction.
The file content also ensures that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public ledger of current accounts that is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to enter this new transaction into this ledger.
It's done by solving a mathematical problem for the computers, whose solver, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the right to add this extra line.
This is the process of cutting a file; that is, transforming a huge file into a smaller, unique digital print.
The computers will take over this new transaction and add a number to it, only to then cut the whole thing up.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (many zeroes at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check it for correctness.
The transaction will then be displayed indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would alter the imprint.
If a user wants to pay twice with the same amount of money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes) for fraud purposes, the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be omitted because each has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly into two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to a hundred millionth, so the margin space is...
The difficulty of the task also increases with increasing computation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were hacked and the stored bitcoins were stolen.
"The loophole used is not the protocol itself", says Pierre Noizat, founder of Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also monitors the potential for money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem applies to cash as well.
Major players like Wikipedia are rejecting gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, are embracing them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron at the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current account ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoin is not in circulation.
In November, the "giant discounts" were introduced.
"Thirty thousand dollars was exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a bitcoin-to-gold exchange.
Pierre Noizat, who also wrote a textbook on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions, which makes it cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up at retailers where no new terminals or software need to be installed.
All it takes is a phone number, which can be "photographed and recognized", says Pierre Noizat, who says he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and move towards more horizontal systems.
"It will be a while before Bitcoin takes hold, but 2013 could be a defining year", he predicts.
In addition, the ECB's report envisages a reassessment of the various risks currently considered to be elevated if this type of money is to succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops are expected to follow in late 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect anything from us.
The worst damage was done to the people in the Afghan countryside, who were punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so did we, for we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but they are often rural people who resist the presence of foreign troops, as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They now enjoy tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The French troop withdrawal from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the almond-planted mountains thanks to French loans, went smoothly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul unattacked, with helicopter escort.
As of late 2014, the Taliban will no longer be as active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable course in 1994-1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time and the country was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different rebel groups.
Their taking control of the land was considered a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans paid a heavy price for the darkness of these villagers, who were completely controlled by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
The former mujahedeen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are all in agreement on keeping women in a subordinate position.
The top brass from the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seizing state land, selling it as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and using huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They've discredited themselves; most of them have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard on the campaign trail, people are craving a government that isn't made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity do: the capital flight is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and were fascinated by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full, with both boys and girls.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they do not want to go back to the darkness of the old parties or the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish series that show the modern world are watched everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that rise to its head be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already re-establishing provincial militias, which will be outside the control of the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should have enjoyed some degree of decentralization following the Western model, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so it abolished the post of prime minister, which had existed since the constitution was adopted in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950's.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Private initiative is preferred.
In a country ravaged by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be essential.
Rumors have spread that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that the Western countries were just there to take it over.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials over the mountains, however, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and have allowed international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist site to preserve its role as the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of their imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual forms of assistance: a girls' and boys' lycée, French departments at universities, a French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the 'win heart and soul' initiative, which attempted to reconcile aid and military activities, was run by the Ministry of Defence's Civil-Military Action Service (CIMIC), which was abolished in 2012, but thanks to a small number of French NGOs, it has achieved a number of successes in the areas of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, involving a number of local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, protection of the soil, and expansion of arable land.
What kind of memory will we leave behind after 2 billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often located above 2 000 m above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural assistance from local communities in Kapisa Province.
To free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, these farmers claim to seek a small amount of public assistance for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affect them.
Difficult Work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Morsi has embarked on another round of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided country in its history over the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, he has chosen to play the bait.
On Wednesday, he announced that, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
Egypt has been using the interim text for almost two years, which has been amended many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal wrangling.
This new initiative has only further divided the country.
In the opposition's view, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion", continues to "break his word" and "trample on the law".
However, its supporters say it is a means to quickly resolve the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum is due in two weeks.
It's a very short time frame that will force the Brotherhood to back down from its intention to clarify text to Egyptians article by article.
For the president, it's also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the country is rocked by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote yes.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text or I will keep unlimited powers", which would otherwise end when the new constitution is approved.
And in this particular atmosphere, yesterday 85 members of the aforementioned constituent assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitution was promulgated, they knocked on doors, saying they had no way to assert their views.
Human rights advocates, civil society, and members of religious minorities have followed suit.
To achieve tolerability, 11 people were hastily added to the replacement ranks yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators also commented that one of the few disputes that day revolved around the... prayer clock, with some committee members holding the view that the clocks in the boardroom were not set correctly.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principle" with the term "rule", allowing for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article was not corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", argue liberals, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
They say the Islamization of the constitution is done through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers on al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular on issues of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "those who speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This is the beginning of the theocracy".
The liberals' concerns are further fueled by the fact that the next university president should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, no specific religious consequences have been seen.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a largely civilian state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama but university workers, many of them graduated from French schools", mildly worries Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on Egypt's constitutional transition.
However, he agrees that "there may be differences in the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used are religious.
There is a reference to fiqh in particular.
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this".
The text approved yesterday is being heavily criticized for its religious aspects and the expanded powers it grants to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in their numbers compared to the previous regime.
Another contentious location: the powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military officials, the audit of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, the trial of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, as the association for the protection of human rights has demanded.
The association expresses its doubts about the text, which they consider to be against freedom.
The criminal act of blasphemy is maintained and insult remains prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article addresses the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point, she said, was the prohibition on torture in Article 36.
That word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaiting holy sites, the belly of the world, and a sea of saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern conveniences, and the untouched nature.
AaF has identified the top five reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bow down to holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all who enter this "bath" will be subjected to divine mercy.
And Galilee - the site of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm, and filling his nets.
There, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But the most holy place is in Jerusalem.
Here, believers will walk the Way of Sorrow, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It starts at the Antonia Fort - Pretoria - where the trial was held, runs through the streets of the Old City, and leads to the Temple of God's Tomb on Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion, the anointing stone, and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews - the Western Wall, a remnant of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various faiths leave wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take the path vertically
The ruins of Masada's fortress are the remains of a secret refuge from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
The wreckage is located on a cliff in the mountains at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level.
Only those who are involved in mountaineering can get to it by themselves.
The rest will be taken to this historic mountain by cable car.
And in the north, at an altitude of 1,600 to 2,040 meters [1,600-2040 ft], is the famous ski resort of Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists during the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the bottom of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, the pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves in the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
His paintings are widely represented in the exhibition by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acre, you can visit the Al Basha Baths Museum, which showcases several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with statues of bath users and bath attendants from the time.
In Caesarea, the unique private Ralli Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the sculptures of Dalí and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly declined.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem, in Tel Aviv - tells the story of one of history's most dramatic pages.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in, and you're in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they're the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also listed.
Improving Your Health
Israel's three main spa resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red, and Dead Seas.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, a dolphinarium, and an oceanarium.
Interestingly, bathing in the Red Sea is possible even during the winter months, since the water temperature in the Red Sea stays at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C] and the air warms up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [23°C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest point on the planet's landmass - at 417 meters below sea level.
The azure water is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps even people who cannot swim afloat.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo a treatment using salt water, saltpeter, and medicinal mud that can treat medical problems like dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your broken nerves.
Touch the mysterious past of the ancient world
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the small town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
They were the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the earliest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it's where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists do love wandering through narrow alleys named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you press against the wall in the alley of your sign, luck will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to have their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the Crusader fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you need not worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population in this country speaks Russian.
It is better to take cash with you, not in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (now about $1.00).
Buses are the main means of transportation in Jerusalem, but there is a high-speed tram system in Jerusalem, and the city of Haifa has the only subway line in the country with six stations, connecting the lower city to the upper city.
It's basically an underground cable car.
All forms of public transport cost six shekels, which is a one-and-a-half-hour drive.
In Israel, the Sabbath is observed on the Sabbath day according to Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transportation are closed.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without skin and foods containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a wide variety of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, ground chickpeas - falafel, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are plenty of weaned cats who gracefully "wander about as they please".
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The front cats love crowded places and will gladly indulge in any good.
Renting a car will cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 a day (Audi A6, Volvo S80), depending on the brand.
Plus the insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets are 30 shekels on average.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The largest number of visitors came from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa abolition of 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" announces to Moscow: emigrants save money on language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "fake" certificates
Each year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support their families at home.
On December 1, a law came into force that will require every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, public utilities, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that in time, the appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Language skills will also be required for obtaining and renewing a work permit.
The exemption applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law also exempts people who successfully passed the certification and obtained an academic diploma before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already in operation in Russia.
The initiative to promote the introduction of testing was also supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question in the press many times: what will it really do?
What will change the requirement to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, migration officials say, it will reduce the number of people who suffer from "slave labor".
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, chairman of the board of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for immigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, says Sebelev, the future migrant is doomed to encounter dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "pass" to a terrible, cramped shelter where he and dozens of others like him will starve for months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've been getting a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive they cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay the wages promised", says Tolib Sharipov, head of Tajikistan's main labour migration administration.
Don't give me that!
Especially since many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia to work admit that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they want to go but have no experience even in the work at hand.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather a misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a decent basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children, not to mention clothe, shoe, and school them properly.
As children grow into working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's difficult, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
It is true that human rights defenders point out one important point regarding the language test law.
The testing will only be done on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't pass their exams or get any other official job.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry is Not Allowed"
Many of the new workers say that it is not easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is, there's all these bureaucratic hurdles and all these language difficulties.
And legalization costs money, from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake license plate can be obtained quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have essentially fake documents, no registration, and that leads to cases of blackmail.
"They charge a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", Umed Chushkadamov, a Tajik citizen, told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that not only immigrants' registration documents were being falsified.
FMS staff have already seized several false certificates of passing a language test.
The forged documents are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for free: each of the migrants paid 7,000 rubles for the document in the hope of easing their test passing problems.
This is two and a half times the amount of passing the official test: it will cost migrant workers 3,000 rubles.
The main task for the near future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot easily buy documents, government officials and human rights advocates agree.
Government authorities can promise foreign workers who fail the tests the first time enough time to complete a basic Russian language course.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
The MVD does not operate an illegal arms market.
The rate of crime involving legally owned weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is proposing to tighten the law on civilian gun owners.
It is a government response to recent events: the shooting at a wedding that went without casualties and a massacre planned by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov that killed seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which a gun license can be obtained from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaia, who promised that amendments to the gun law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to tackle the problem by tightening the screws.
An open letter has appeared online, with the authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanding a rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of registered gun hooliganism is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, in an interview with the BBC's Russia section.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 offences involving firearms registered by the Ministry of Interior were committed in the first six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the law on civilian weapons will not force the perpetrator to go to the "black" market.
According to them, at present, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the illegal proliferation of weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired Colonel Victor Baraniec, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept weapons orders
The first of these - "military or military road", that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The guns were stolen by Russian officers and by Caucasians themselves", says Ram.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security officials.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police stores and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
The illegal "mainly" comes into the market from military warehouses.
Explosions are common in many military warehouses.
"It's been proven that some fires were started deliberately - to cover up the maniac", says a former soldier.
The weapons manufacturers are also contributing, Baranes said.
"At present, private arms companies are emerging that are not competitive on the international market and are eliminating the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow", he says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of handguns and automatic rifles come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes small arms are produced here, and the mafia has been established to organize their smooth production", explains a former soldier.
Where'd you get the gun?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each source of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Design in Public Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all guns ended up on the black market "because of officials whose jobs are related to guns", says the report.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of the weapons were stolen during their production, 5% are "black archaeology".
A sales consultant at an arms store who asked not to be named believes that weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" have long been out of stock - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, the vendors go to the military warehouse to pick up new shipments.
The ensign will buy a unit, like a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, he sells it over the fence.
"He takes it into town and sells it for 900 euros a piece with two cans", he says.
"The truth is that the police are well-informed, so whenever they get a bad rap, they check the dealers", adds the consultant.
"It's like a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers are most likely to find each other through their acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until this guy showed up and offered me the opportunity to go to the "Trial" platform, where there's a man who's gonna take me to a "corner" where we can negotiate together.
I learned the price mainly there
Military reporter Viktor Baraniec
"If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out", says the salesman-advisor.
The vendors are in the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell that his daughter's tooth fell out".
And now I'm getting there through a man I'm sure of.
He also only delivers to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraniec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was working on a book on the subject.
The patterns didn't change, according to him.
They gave him a photo album that said "everything you could think of".
"It felt like a luxury store", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, says Lamb, is not offered a hare in a bag - you can try anything.
I, the prospect, don't just buy - I go into the woods with the seller and we target him.
"They give me the ability to fire, and when I'm sure the gun fires well, we take action", describes the expert.
The couch tray
Internet search engines will take you to a website and a group on "Vkontakte" that offers to buy guns "for various purposes".
No papers or personal meetings are required.
"Just have a certain amount of money", says the headline on the website "Buy a combat pistol or machine gun".

And selling to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - this is a short formulation of the request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently shut down a vast network of crawled websites and people who wish to buy a military weapon can grab a shovel.

I've heard of such schemes: Websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment via an ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photograph and a description with instructions on where the gun is hidden", says Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Gun.
Viktor Baraniec confirms that once you place an order on the website you can be left without a weapon and end up behind bars.

It 's a $100 Makarov .
Experts estimate that buying an illegal firearm usually costs between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO Right to Gun, you can get a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You'll have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from long-term storage through the medium-range storage facilities.
According to the Official Statistical Office, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% in total between January and October 2011, to 22,900 cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers are on strike in the United States
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers will pass the McDonald's checkbook
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has been taking place in the United States at Walmart hypermarkets and at popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or if it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole action is supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the meager salaries of ordinary workers at Walmart and fast food chains, the protest organizers aim to build their own union organizations.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when a wave of low-cost sales swept America, engulfing millions of people and sometimes even causing fights.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated alongside unions and left-wing activists of multinational retail chains whose goods are targeted at the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners and eggs and milk all over the world.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores shop only at their jobs.
The availability and variety of products made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because it pays its employees too little.
They also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of automated wheelchairs or hand-held scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company had skyrocketed from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker earns $9.5 an hour, but that's not the amount of expenses, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That's an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries right now.
If Walmart were to shift the pay rise entirely onto the shoulders of consumers, it would cost only 46 cents more per store visit.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest was held in only nine countries and should cause virtually no harm to the company.
Black Friday in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart was selling about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
In total, its cash registers processed almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post, Walmart spokesman Dan Fogelman said that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs altogether, and that the protest was "just another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Cashier is unoccupied!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where they targeted not Walmart stores (they are not very popular in the progressive city, so they are almost non-existent) but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says they sell billions of servings, and then they don't even pay you sick leave and pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 an hour, in accordance with federal and state laws.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing that wage, but only slightly, and their average New York City worker is paid $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive town gets a lower salary.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time after school and live with their parents will get a job at McDonald's.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there long.
I'm constantly in conversation with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children with it.
On the other hand, a commentary on the Wall Street Journal forum notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast food establishments start getting paid at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of trade unions and punishing union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, the introduction of trade union organisation in fast food establishments is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the exceptionally high turnover of the workforce.
Disagreement
On that day, loud protests were also held at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The event culminated in a rally at McDonald's near Times Square at noon, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, most notably City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even pay you sick pay and don't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The protesters also drew support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fast food workers so they can get the fair pay for their work and the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves!"
The New York Times described it as the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended, though not all were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has been able to lie on average".
Augmented reality is a popular topic among fans of modern virtual reality technologies; lately, this means seeing the world through the lens of special glasses.
Google presented a working model of this innovation at its annual conference earlier this summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
An interview with Sharam Izadim, head of interactive 3D technology at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, shows that for Microsoft scientists, glasses are a thing of the past.
They're attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us briefly what your research group is doing?
- We're dealing with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we're trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the pixel stage of a flat screen, at most touching the screen with your finger.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and predict significant changes in this interaction.
So, for example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors -- that's a step up, and almost no Xbox is going to be sold today without the Kinect sensors, because there's a very interesting gesture control option for everybody.
What else is in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has brought interaction to a physical level, a lot of interaction still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information flow has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not improved much.
We're trying to change that, by working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, this requires knowledge not only of the user but also of the environment around him.
Then we can add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It certainly cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our environment about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not the wavy ones, just the little ones, the short ones.
The gesture would be recorded not by a camera on the device but by a bracelet that would monitor the movement of the bones and muscles.
It's big for now, but theoretically, it can be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future has a mixed type of control, like gesture + voice.
- How did you do that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to identify.
So you want to make the user adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at a given moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a bonding.
I think in the near future, we're going to have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a pretty good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If you're going to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution or depth or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation -- that's what we can bounce off of in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, but the matrix and the depth.
The way we look at it right now, all the technologies that we have today are not good enough for us -- that puts a lot of work on the algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z axes.
So speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data streams of 30 frames per second are quite frankly a bit low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes at our lab in Redmond has made a touch sensor with a processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, which is adjustable, whereas current mass-produced sensors are closer to 60 to 100 ms.
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I could use a very useful equivalent of this device at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra snaps per second.
- And the increase in cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three 'cameras', one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a reflected signal receiver.
And now the third camera -- this is actually a standard visible-band sensor.
It's not used to determine the depth of an object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse because it would increase the amount of computation required.
It would be nice to build a flexible analog Kinect system, play around with the curvature of the camera's position and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present their glasses.
Don't you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with the smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think the most powerful option would be a "portable" form of augmented reality, where you could switch from glasses to smartphones, projection screens and so on and so forth, using a cloud platform.
Glasses - these are very personal devices, that's their strength (only you can see private things), and also their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
My hand feels nothing!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- I often say in my lectures that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the addition of tactile senses could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is using the other hand as a kind of imaging medium.
It's a great way to record compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding palpability to these "airborne images" -- for example, interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is, it creates a tactile sensation, but it's still very faint -- like blowing on the belly of your fingers.
There is also a wristband that affects nerve endings in the fingers - another promising development.
- Have you ever tried to fool the brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here comes another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very tight space believe that he is walking through an open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If deceiving the brain becomes the goal, it's a job for years to come.
That's what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers -- a lot of things are just beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is a continuation of the St. Petersburg Avant-garde project, dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront of the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already the major figures of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without achieving nationwide fame.
The new hero of "Rosbald" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashionable pubs and at the opening.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, the creator of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - he's a prominent man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
Besides being a city man, his presence on the streets brings smiles to the faces of the citizens, raises everyone's spirits.
He recently took up the bottle and became the St. Petersburg bottler, having matured into this challenging role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town in red instead of yellow or turquoise?
I chose red as a design for appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the public.
Although, generally, anything slightly different from gray will spark aggression and evoke bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at getting a conversation going.
My entire history of provocative acts is primarily an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture on Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I've figured out what my path is.
It was a time when the old wave of unofficial freelance artists had passed, and the new, freelance types of artists I couldn't understand.
I made friends with the new wave artists, the post-Gazonovists, who led us to the Pushkin 10 and there were no other waves.
It draws me to theater, to dress, to music, to all genres except words.
- And all this was merged in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I took a seat on Pushkin 10 and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemians, before the reconstruction.
There were many: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how they brought String with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Strun and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight t-shirts, in the middle of them the composer Igor Widowin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many of the programs of the Hali-Gallic times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and that was the beginning of his great career, his basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the echo of the Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and regular guests left.
I'm a hero from a century ago when culture still mattered.
In 2000, a survey was conducted, and the special prize was "People in our city".
I was nominated for Artist of the Year, and that was the end of my peak.
In the new times, the old rules are unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty and last century culture.
It's easy to become popular these days, but culture and popularity are different things now, you can be popular but not too cultured.
Your work is distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings are hits that vividly capture the timeliness and the insight.
I'm having a programming exhibition called "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be a sociable man, now being one is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is erased, tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by masquerading as totalitarian in order.
People today are identified by their clothes, by the mechanics of the outside, not the man inside.
Or maybe you can't reach out your hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by disguise.
- We saw you play the city's bottle-player. - A cultural city should have a hero like that.
And who's supposed to be if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
Before, people used to gather in crowds, bohemians loved one, simple people another.
Today, everything has broken down into micro-societies, it's very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everybody.
Today's the day to think about who you like.
Every cultural hero has 100 fans these days.
- And Stas Mikhailov will be attended by several thousand spectators!
- He's got fans coming to him, the sexual social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural land and 10,000 don't, and the result is less management, less money, everything goes to waste.
I have fans, the important thing is that no one cheats them and ruins what's lived.
When I was young, I painted these pictures that were hanging on the walls of a collector's house with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the pictures that people usually end up with.
People often confuse terms today.
They say, "Culture is spiritual, culture is consumer".
There's no consumer culture, that's from somewhere else.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, raised by artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, turned down money to paint.
And I'm all for that culture.
Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a term for this: cultural agent.
But not all of them can be involved in culture.
In the time of the regular tsars, this was not always the case, the tsars may not have understood much of the culture, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck in a corner somewhere, because we need great experts to properly evaluate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, taste is thriving.
Tatarstan, Erart, but they differ in that they honestly say that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg - it's not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And our eel is doing poorly in the arts.
We need culture, but we have more writers than readers.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We're a very weak class.
We need art to become a fashion item, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the assistance of the St. Petersburg grant
Giving birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or a killer asteroid strike.
Caravans of space ships with Earthlings on board are setting out, searching for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the key question is: How do you keep your race in zero gravity or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be taken, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P. K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (SAIS).
But while Mars has better conditions for life, the surface of Venus is as warm as 500 degrees Celsius.
Life is only possible at high altitude or in orbit around Venus... in space.
To solve the problems of reproduction in space, scientists began with the flora.
Experiments on plants were done half a century ago.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their Earth relatives.
Then an insect was put into orbit - a very small fruit fly, Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to test how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal dick on the way out.
But then trouble starts.
"The problem is that this bird has to find support, stand on its own two feet and move", says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) at RAN.
If they don't find support, the birds fall chaotically and make a roar.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds had completely lost their instincts.
The birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they were just dead in four days.
"We had the birds hatch twice, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them there", comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the chicken experiment in space.
The last miniarch with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But in the Bion biosatellite, there will only be one-sex creatures.
They ran an experiment on rats that were being sent into space already pregnant.
They didn't actually find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be done", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, the space rats produced offspring.
But no one has yet come close to solving the problem of reproduction in space.
It's a tough job.
Animals, when they lose their natural environment, simply cannot exercise their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is a master of abstract thought and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, we don't do experiments like this.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Tea Party took off and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive the space flight.
I wonder if she can deliver a baby after flying like that.
"No one has answered that question yet", says rocketry veteran Vachtang Wachnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also a cosmonaut, Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, a son was born to the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savická, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in outer space.
But the risk remains.
We have very few astronauts who have long-term healthy offspring.
"It can also be dangerous in orbital flights", says cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet, mankind must inevitably seek new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolab is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero gravity conditions, astronauts are learning the habits needed to work in open space.
Water is imitating weightlessness.
While for adults, water is a convenient, but in a way strange environment, for young children, it is a natural element.
The tiny ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth originated in the ocean.
There's a correlation between the fact that a baby spends an average of nine months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it's easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only two weeks pass.
"That's not much to forget", says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for a newborn baby, then inevitable gravity, the force of attraction, is more natural for women.
In weightlessness, there's a very rapid wasting of the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can leave that out, as long as the muscle stimulators work during labor.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber, where the mother's body ejected the fetus.
"What's next?" Valery Polyakov asks the difficult questions.
On the other hand, a baby also needs artificial gravity.
Without the force of gravity, an organism cannot properly form a skeleton or muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special weight suit in which to train.
He'll just be deprived of what he absolutely needs to grow.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows a child to be born in an alien environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unsuited to the environment", predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP RAN's bioethics committee.
So having babies in space is a theoretical question today.
But one day, the time will come when it will become a reality and the Earthlings will sail in their ships to a distant planet to become the home of their offspring born in space.
The head of the NKU: control of the smuggling system failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and good legislation on public procurement, but it is lagging in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálne.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Control Office Miloslav Kala says this.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - that's what I think we lack", comments Kala on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint audit of the Czech and German auditors.
As an example of wrongdoing, he cites Peter Nečas's approach to the so-called "smear system".
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS will not bother businessmen with its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be set in place, and if it forbids something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the work of the office, which is supposed to check and enforce", notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was it about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation governs how public procurement is handled, followed by national legislation and then by practice.
We have put all this together and although the control is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences - in general terms, the legislation is perhaps "strict and more perfect" here, but the practice itself is better in Germany in some respects.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create ever more precise rules, but that the application of the law itself needs to be addressed.
What can this project do for you, what does it do for you?
It is this kind of joint control that could help us to stop spending our efforts on clarifying laws, reducing and improving limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But by lowering the order limit, we may not necessarily achieve that.
Perhaps the system will become so overwhelmed with paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will find it much easier to draw on it than if the limit were to remain higher.
You're talking about domestic problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NCC, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in a similar way to us, functions as the NCA does, and it has a collegium, only it is set up in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities act in a similar way.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, it also has these courts of account at the level of individual Länder - in this the system differs slightly from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country is state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities, are controlled at the level of the Federal Court of Auditors.
As far as the legislation there is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany is considered a model, but it is not certain that it is better in everything.
Does it have to be because they have better controls?
I'm sure not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But I have to say, even the countries we consider to be role models, they have a whole host of problems.
Otherwise, there's no point in them working with our office, is there?
As for the domestic legislation, what has the revision of the Public Procurement Act meant for your office? Are its effects already being felt?
Since the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been implemented in our control measures.
Since we do ex post checks, there is a certain delay to be expected.
We are only seeing this so far in the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new 'risk of inefficiency detection' tool, through which we have run almost 14 000 public contracts and analysed them - where these changes will obviously be reflected, because the limits will change, the conditions of certain types of competition will be adjusted and so on.
So, do you see the passage of this bill as a benefit or as an added burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think this bill is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it's confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will become "tougher" and impossible to follow.
Under the previous rules, the controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, by the regional council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth tightening the law in this way?
I mean, not like this.
The system must exclude those who seek to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit a formal error that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's show each other where the road doesn't lead.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not harass businessmen with controls of the so-called "sweatshop system" - and what does that mean?
Is the smuggling system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be set in place, and if it forbids something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of the office that is supposed to control and enforce the duties.
He can say, "We're gonna change the law and allow it", but he can't say we're gonna do nothing.
The Public Procurement Act has quite strict rules as to what should be done formally - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best offer is eliminated for mere formality.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think we lack.
The roads are icy, but mostly paved.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are icy and also snow-covered.
But most of the time, the roads are paved, somewhere with extra care.
The Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were clear this morning, but the places were frozen and snowed.
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero, but it's expected to warm up slightly during the day.
The region has lost snow, and only a thin layer remains in the lowlands.
However, the crests of the Cretaceous Mountains have about 12 inches [30 cm] of snow.
The visibility was also lower due to fog, according to the regional road traffic control.
The R6 expressway and the first-class roads are now free to drive in the region.
Caution is needed, however, for example on some bridges where the surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
But in some areas, the ice and snow still remain.
Particular attention should be paid to riding at higher altitudes.
Pardubice and Kralovehradecký region
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are at risk of frost, and snow may fall on highways at higher elevations and in the mountains, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways reports on its website.
Road operators warn drivers about frost, which may occur especially in the higher elevations of the Pardubice region.
The catchment area may be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemical treatment of I/43 and I/34 roads near Svitav.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Krkonoše and Orlic Mountains.
The snow cover is at the highest points on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic, the weather is mostly clear to semi-clear today, with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with light winds blowing.
The Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are clear this morning, but the roads are to be used with extreme caution and the weather is to be adapted.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some roads may be frozen.
Drivers will also have to deal with fog, but visibility will improve gradually.
That's according to the information from the regional road traffic control.
The D5 is almost unrestricted, but traffic authorities recommend caution between 50 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads are dry and icy.
But there may be frozen areas in southern Pilsen and Tachov.
The second and third class communications are wet and the warning for icy sections also applies in this case.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest points of Olomouc County must expect snow on the road today.
After the chemical spraying, it remained on the Red Mountain Saddle and on the way to Videlsk cross.
The snow had driven the road workers out into the countryside at night, with road officials reporting about an inch of snow in Shumperska.
In the rest of the county, the roads are mostly unrestricted.
"The highest points of Summerski are covered with snow.
With snow on the Red Mountain ridge, drivers must expect to see the snow towards Jeseník", said the dispatcher of the Czech Highway Administration.
Their colleagues in Jesenick were also out in the field at night, and the roads to the highest positions are now, they say, bare and wet after the chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are free of traffic restrictions, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forested areas where the roads remain wet.
The following entries are added:
Several difficult parking spots are being reported this morning by traffic officials in northern Bohemia.
In addition to a few places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnica to Knínice in Ústeck is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept below zero even at lower elevations, so ice and snow are likely to be sustained on the roads.
No operational complications have been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by road operators especially from around the county of Szczecin.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for it at night were ideal - rain and snowmelt during the day and clear and freezing at night.
There are also reports of adverse conditions on the I/13 road between the Ústecký and Liberecký regions.
The closure from Telnica to Knínice was forced by the curved branches of trees that bent under the snow cover to the road.
We want to gather positive energy at concerts.
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just another scarecrow we humans like to grab.
And with The Tap Tap, we're kind of making fun of it, saying that we're the only band in the world that can harness enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
And in December, you're going to have a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to our readers?
This is a national fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We've decided to capitalize on the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20th, from 9 pm, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the time the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Whose idea was it?
It was probably my idea at first, but then we came up with it with our designer, Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to engage with the public to think about what kind of world we're going to pass on to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of original shoe, T-shirt, bag or key items for the end of the world that people can also support by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world called "End of the World Cancelled".
It's already very popular on YouTube, will it be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and that's in the end, if we do everything right and the world doesn't end...
It's sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will also be simultaneously linked in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The lyrics to this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, and Xindl X...
How did you get involved with them?
We're also working with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, as we're organizing a lot of charity events and concerts...
We're trying to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What's the end of the world concert proceeds going to?
To equip the barrier-free education center Studeo, which we have been implementing for six years with the civic association Tap in the Jedličko Institute.
Students of Jedličko's Institute are regularly visited by lecturers and engaged in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
The students themselves don't have the means to present themselves as lecturers, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
As part of the construction of the Jedličko Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, into which we will move with this project.
There are several bands and performers at each concert.
What did you choose them on?
We've been trying to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
You can find out more at www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any similar "bombing" plans for the future?
In May we will perform at Prague Spring for the first time, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, once we are in the US, I would like to link this with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks.
We have five members on the electric wheelchair, her wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we also carry a lot of cargo and tool boxes...
However, so far we have always managed without problems, ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, I wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was no problem.
Travel abroad allows you to compare how people differ in accessibility, public access to disabled people and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where things are working better than here, we have just seen in Russia that things are still in their infancy in the East.
Moscow is very barrier-free compared to Prague, where it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move around the city centre alone.
It doesn't even take for granted that you prefer wheelchair users in the elevator.
Fortunately, civil society organizations are already emerging to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
And what are we still missing from the advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind on...
But it's important to note that improvement and improvement of a situation always depends on the efforts of the people involved.
It's quite common in London and Madrid for people with severe disabilities to be able to move around in public by themselves, go to the toilet, go to a museum, anywhere...
It's not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to be actively involved in the community, but we're a little ahead of the Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being open is one thing, but it's only when we become great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really start to change.
So far, these are rare cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band nowadays, but let's go back a few years, what made you start in 1998?
I joined the Jedlička Institute as a tutor, where I was surrounded by many young people who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so I started a hobby music club with a colleague.
And as time went on, as our host, Lada Angelovic, says, things got a little out of hand.
But it's only in recent years that it's become popular, am I right?
True, it helped when we began associating with well-known singers and also actively promoting the band.
We realized that work that you can't see, you don't actually see, doesn't really exist.
And thanks to the European Union's contributions, we can afford quality speakers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get the Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of things where one imitates the other.
It's kind of logical, everything new is taken with a grain of salt and takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression a person makes when they see us is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But that pity is completely useless, because disabled people are not all the suffering, abandoned creatures we have to pity.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I say that when people with disabilities do something, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for society.
Did your being a strict boss, as many people have called you, help with that success?
To do good work, we must be firm in many things and demand a certain amount of discipline.
I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with romantic visions and their heads in the clouds, and when they find that they have to audition twice a week, go to rehearsals and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, their enthusiasm quickly fades.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there when it started in 1998?
There's only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
The door is always open to anyone with a will and a taste.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava Plynojemu with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected by telebrushes at the end of the evening as the Tap Tap band performs "End of the World Cancelled".
The concert aims to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free education center STUDEO at the Jedličko Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
The concert ticket is CZK 400, children under 12 years old have free entry at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of ESA ministers, the second former Eastern bloc country (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of ESA projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already interested in space flights before World War II; but they were not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933, presenting ideas from his pioneering work Introduction to Astronautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his entry into space in France.
The late Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and space exploration.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of space exploration, and his contribution was recognized by the naming of a crater on the far side of the moon after him.
As early as 1925, a railway drainage system was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the design is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It's also unclear if the missile was intended to launch the drezin or to slow it down.
Information about this drezin is only known from the contemporary press.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to use rocket-propelled grenades.
The research was carried out by the Armament Technology Cell in collaboration with Prof. Mieczysław Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the surviving materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, the arrival of the German troops interrupted the research.
In 1937, a photoelectric fighter rocket designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work Rakiet - torpedo powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwy-Krzywobloky was published.
Both projects were designed for military use with rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were devoted to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities were terminated by the outbreak of war.
Further works on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of the company is in the November 1954 issue of Problems magazine, which features four more extensive articles on astronautics.
One of them, by Professor M. Subotowicze, proposes the creation of a company that will deal with space.
By that time, satellite projects were well under way, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, PTA played a significant role in the development of the highly successful RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, with a range of 1,800 meters, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of the RM-2 two-stage rocket were started in the Bled desert.
The rocket was four feet long and weighed about 11 pounds.
The next development type was already capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to track high winds.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RMs was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) which differed in the size of space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B had a space of 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C had a space of 0.62 litres.
Maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, with first flight tests beginning in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a takeoff weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Works Act.
The resolution has sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the various economic units, the national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in labour prices (wages) is to create price tensions.
This is a situation where a producer tries to compete by importing a cheap product by 'subverting' the price of a competitor in order to gain a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, buying cheaply there, or disappearing.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The situation is exacerbated by the total reluctance of the businessmen to pay taxes to compensate for the economic and social damage they have done to society in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
The ruthless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital a chance to own their own population regardless of social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes to the legislation in force.
The aim is to economically force the own population to accept the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done by a system of economic coercion in the case of longterm unemployment and by restricting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with growing disparities between rich and poor.
In the FRG, public food distribution schemes have existed for many years for the poor who cannot support themselves by their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people who are properly employed to be paid such wages that the state has to supplement them up to the subsistence level.
A similar scandal was made public in the case of the auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation, where people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social standards are forced to either emigrate as in the 19th century or live on starving wages on the margins of society in the hope that perhaps some day private investment capital will come into the country.
But the question is, where does it come from?
If it's from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another, or it doesn't come at all, because the Chinese, the Indian, the Brazilian, or the Turkish, the Moroccan, or the Egyptian, or the African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This is for all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media are tired of saying that the state cannot participate in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital firmly insists that the state must not intervene in the economy by means of controlled interventions.
Then one has to ask whether private capital does not influence, does it not now actually control politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense?
The answer is, yes.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the areas of corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where virtually everything is punishable but nothing is.
In the FRG, the situation is such that the State ministries for lack of funds entrust the drafting of legislation to private law firms, which are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as Western-style constitutions claim, but from financially powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly entering a situation described by Appianus in his Crisis of the Roman Republic under Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete decay, and the authorities have been seized by force.
For bribery, illegal solicitation of favors, and using stones or swords.
Corruption and bribery flourished without any restraint and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote"... "...the people of character did not care for office at all, so that once a state was made for eight months without consuls as a result of this disruption"... "...it was indeed said that the only remedy for a bad situation was self-government and that an energetic man should be elected"...
Conclusion As in ancient times, modern society is based on the ruthless preference of self-interest over the common good.
Private capital is no longer inherently capable of understanding and applying the benefit of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any attempt at any deeper reform.
The cause of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be traced to the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy can be seen as a pause in the waiting for the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignorant of the potential for future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity as we know them from history, old and new.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the solution, at least not permanently.
Under pressure from competition at both international and intra-European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social standard of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted socio-political reforms that will increase the participation of state capital in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"Nothing can come of violence, and never will" Sting in Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is "Let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Guttela Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, sparked a lot of reactions.
Some are for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense and that the Palestinians fit the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the racism of the state of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the culprit and who is the victim in the periodically recurring waves of killing, after all, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the onset of violence.
My aim is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, a glimpse into who is primarily served by the 95 years of tension (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by available historical facts, some of it is derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people are the primary drivers of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of power struggles.
In every age, we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was always these individuals who were completely autonomous in directing their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone still stands above them I don't know, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course I can.
The first news agency, Reuters, was bought back in the 1890s to stop associating their name with the highly criminal activities they were behind, which for them always meant consolidating power, increasing wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the central bank stakes are not waging or preparing wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there are only four countries, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the Rothschild central bank status to the Bank of America, began issuing his own (understand government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
JFK started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by the highest, 33rd degree of initiation Mason Albert Pike in 1859-71.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchical states in Europe, the second to eliminate colonial rule, especially Great Britain, and the third to reduce the world's population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and does not consume so many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a prelude to such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method used by a group of wealthy families led by the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
So after they succeeded in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg successor to the throne Ferdinand of Russia in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended abruptly, with no military or economic justification, with the capitulation of Germany (no longer needed to destroy Tsarist Russia), followed by the disintegration of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers let politicians create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then they only had to push the Germans a strong enough, guilty-guilty and simple solution offering the Führer and further creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and also played, the function of a fifth column in igniting the war fire.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, as already mentioned, created the conditions for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks have been on both sides.
When World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke free from the chain that initially held him captive by international bankers, or whether all he did was plan, it's hard to say, but the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially established in 1948, and like the reparations Germany received in World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focus of a third war.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the latter, will be the casualties on the front lines of the fighting, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also on an international scale (just consider how sharply divided people are between supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when it all started with the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, we need to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are giving people the choice in elections to choose their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, politician who does everything to start a war with Iran that, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to escalate into a global conflict and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all the world's oil passes (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to destroy the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 now appear: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order".
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the convenience of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted with a chip at birth that makes them a totally controlled being.
"And it causes all to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast.
The number represents a man, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six".
When the going gets tough, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled the revolution to the US, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as it would have seriously jeopardized the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not able to be achieved.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, later exacerbated by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iran debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Directed by Ben Affleck, Argo chronicles one episode of that history that brought America its small victories.
Just before the embassy was taken, six of its employees escaped.
After a series of complicated mishaps, they ended up at the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of a film crew touring the country for the filming of a sci-fi feature.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend believable, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, but also a caper movie, a story of a successful piece, a betrayal - an example of which is Danny's series of accomplices.
The film alternates between moods - on one side, documentary sequences from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs of events and the way the same situations were portrayed in the film - there are no major differences).
On the other side, a light-hearted Hollywood passage, treated with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the conference tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable career reboot.
He went from being a derided actor to a respected director, and his acting was no longer the subject of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It's also the first Affleck film not set in the director's hometown of Boston.
The sense of place was one of the characteristics that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is showing it in the Arg, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in a reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the embassy fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when history moves in a blur.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his collaborators in the fictional scenes (a fake staff at a Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told doesn't really offer much in the cinematic sense of suspenseful scenes.
He works with the kid quite successfully, sometimes he makes up his mind about reality - it's not as elegant as it used to be (the scene where the impending crisis at Tehran airport turns off the phone in America and the runway chase seems pretty drawn to the hair).
But the weakness of the ARG is the distraction that comes from having to show too many stories in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming as Hollywood co-stars, but their characters deserve more space and they're far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film loses a little bit of the dramatic edge, and it's a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciating the execution and retro style evoking the thrillers of the '70s.
It's hard to pull.
As a reminder of a still somewhat vivid history and proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence are, but enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to launch a competition on the "most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"We were led to this by the recent event when the EU is planning to adopt a 40% quota for women in the leadership of large European companies", said Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the rates of insurance for men and women.
Until now, women have been given a premium in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of the year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include a mandatory blending of biofuels, which is damaging to the environment, a ban on reliable mercury thermometers, which contain relatively few dangerous substances, and a directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
Criticism has also previously been directed at the de facto ban on the use of the term 'butter' or the withdrawal of traditional light bulbs from sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from a business or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic now even enforces the demands of its banks by veto).
The lobby also argued that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to be at least 14 cm long and not have to show 'anomalous curvature'.
The European Commission has defended itself by simply harmonising the previously inconsistent national standards that had complicated trade.
The EU has already softened the rules on fruit and vegetables, despite opposition from some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The EU regulation last year that inflatable balloons must be labelled with a warning that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision is also a candidate to win the poll.
The EU has cited US research showing that balloons between toys are the leading cause of death from asphyxiation in children.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 when blowing on parade jackets.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd - anyone who holds any official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, and must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
The Banking fees.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State as one of the absurdities mentioned above.
The EU has set maximum quantities of food stocks that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the prescribed volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which it faced a high fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting grants to applicants for a grant.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by not having the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund", said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), then Minister of Agriculture, in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that we had a lot of grain and that the so-called intervention purchases meant that the warehouses were full and he had to export them.
The EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros to keep the Czech Republic close to ports, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally accommodated the Czech Republic by holding a tender to buy grain from countries without access to the sea.
The subsidy was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), specifically to prepare applications for the grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations in the Member States are easily criticised, many experts say that the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to make the whole Union work and develop more efficiently deserve recognition.
A more serious problem, experts say, is the use of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration but which have been forced on themselves by the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The Czech people are also excited by the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic is fighting in Brussels for the right to specifically label its traditional products, and is not always successful in this battle.
Although the Czechs defended the name Olomouc after a six-year war with the Germans and Austrians, our local rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed local.
Only products from cane distillate, not sugar beet, may bear the name rum.
The official EU list of registered products already includes world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, and Parma ham, such as Karlovy Vary dry sausages, Pohořelecký and Tréboň carp and hops.
The EU trade mark can also be used for Pardubice pipes and fire pipes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does a person think he wants to run for president?
I'm not trying to be a senator or a president.
If our country was running smoothly, I wouldn't be running.
But I can't stand to see the country robbed for the last 20 years, with thieves running around, people raising taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm already 40 and an independent, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you soon left for the Castle.
Doesn't that turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've said all along that I'd go to the battle for Castle based on the Senate election results.
I later made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool to make my vision a reality.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is, not only do we as a nation swear in pubs and on TV, but we trample on anyone who tries to make a difference.
Add to that the media that dehumanizes man and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I was accused of bribing journalists or being an adviser to George Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You went into the fight for the castle with a thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and back confessions of property over 20 million.
You'll have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you don't have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can make laws.
How do you want to handle this?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make guiding a free profession, it was passed.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, they deliberately reject it, and that holds the citizens back.
As an independent, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties in Parliament.
My advantage is that without partisan boxing and dogma, I can take what's best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you prefer to be on the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people rank me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone's on the left or the right, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're happy when someone calls you a populist.
But you don't prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're getting close to.
Some might call it populism, but all of the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by leading experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll be left with only passwords.
And that's not gonna do you any good in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that by going out and talking to people, you're going to be able to enforce, say, criminal and property liability?
I have no other choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public to try and get on our side to make it happen.
If I were elected president, I would have no problem hosting a live television broadcast where I would ask the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legislate corporal and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
If you have a strong personality who can name the bad guys, you can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was a public pressure.
I'm being honest, I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and vision.
I'm just getting started in politics and I'm trying to get a majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things along on my own, and if I don't, I'm gonna quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything in one person, so I've been going around to a lot of famous people to see if they'd run for the Senate, too.
I went to see Radim Yanchura, he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenca, who was exposing the light fuel oil scams.
I ran with the idea that people were really unhappy, but now I'm on the draught.
Sixty percent of the people didn't vote, and those who did mostly voted for the establishment.
We're the only two independents in the Senate.
The people have manipulated the Senate to make it difficult to enforce the changes.
I will still fight for my vision, like direct election of mayors or captains.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time to go through the clean history of every potential party, and I don't have the money to do that.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, I only have 20 grand in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
Speaking of property claims, what's yours?
Private property, I'd estimate at about 60 million.
I have a property in Prague for about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of art for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb for a million and then I have a couple of million in the account.
By the way, the reason I got the Aston Martin is because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against evil and bad.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own $60 million in assets, and you don't have campaign funds?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put much money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million dollars for the campaign.
You want me to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program probably isn't that popular.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
My campaign expenses will basically be covered by what I'm getting as a senator.
But I wouldn't be able to make a living from it, for example, I couldn't afford to pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't be running.
So you're going to keep doing business to make a living?
Didn't you say you'd suppress these activities?
But it's not about the salary.
As promised, I've partially dampened my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the travel agent in the spring.
People would like me to be the Samaritan who would save the Republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much did you usually make as a businessman?
200 to 400 grand, which I'm taking.
And if I were president, I'd shut down my business.

The architects of MVRDV are proof that real adventures don't just happen in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 pictures
"The building looks cheerful, futuristic, and finally something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, walking alongside.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says, "Of course, the house is nice".
But I ask, why do we need a library today?
Everybody has the Internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-fashioned libraries are voluntarily open anymore, are they?
Spijkenisse, a settlement just outside Rotterdam with no work opportunities of its own, not even worth visiting, holds a remarkable record.
This municipality of 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To remedy this stupid situation, a few years ago a decision was made to contribute to general education by building seven beautifully painted iron-concrete miniature fictional bridges, as depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the education offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councilmen realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of wildly daring column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual calm and showed up at the 2003 competition with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the committee was still looking around in amazement and shrugging their shoulders, the insolent Maas stacked his gifts on top of each other in order of size and ended his activist-led speech with the words "Dear City People!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was topped at a cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Mountain of Books was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small-town gray area that until now has been unable to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind the white facade of which you would expect a dairy, is now enriched by a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
It 's a long way to the book .
First impression: a reading eldorado under the cheese cover.
Although there is an elevator through the mountain, you will discover true spatial and reading passion only by walking over the topography.
The glass interior is bright and transparent on all sides, the floor of the burnt-out cabin and the elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, and a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books everywhere, books, books.
"Normally, bookshelves line the facade, and in the middle is a large dark space that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We've built the classic space configuration upside down and we've stretched the space for the readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is well-used: the center houses offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home appliance center.
A special treat is the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall paneling, sometimes a window sill, and sometimes a stairway railing.
The look, texture and smell are alien.
Even the most accomplished architects and civil engineers are shaking their heads over unknown building materials.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials", says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by the Standard magazine.
So one day, at a farm in Frisco, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
Millimeter-sized synthetic rune has been used for many years as a rootstock in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
Thin fabric lasts one or two seasons and then it's ripe to be thrown away in bulk.
For the library, the rune was cut into four-centimeter-thick plates - the first time it had been cut in such quantity.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (LBP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
You take 105 steps to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter trek, you will be rewarded in the literary café with not only a fantastic view of the city but also Dutch croquettes and figs in flower pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but most importantly the right humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You might not believe it, but despite the many glass panes, this house is an example of ecological design", says Trouborst.
It heats and cools with the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books is under a glass lid, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide wooden bars, perpendicular to the glass facade, act as shade and absorb much of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, a beginner skeptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, whom Boekenberg even refers to as the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from their personal fund.
The first step was to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which now numbers 70,000 items.
The concept worked.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that our invitation has now given each resident a certain relationship to the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
That's what MVRDV has done in the royal discipline of what's called, in professional parlance, identity formation.
Spijkenisse was writing the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
It's ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to US-European relations expert Stephen Szabo, this puts Berlin on a narrow diplomatic edge.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think they'll support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the no-fly zone.
It was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on important international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that they are changing their foreign policy, from a policy that was, so to speak, controlled by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is made more difficult by the lack of coherent and unified policies in Europe.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play more independent roles, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just settling into their role, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, like they have in France or Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to take positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners when it comes to national interests.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and its relations with certain regions, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of other Great Powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the stance on the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf countries.
So they have to be careful not to intimidate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It's a factor, though.
I don't want to overstate the importance of this, but it's not a one-sided relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German thinking.
Did Germany's abstention from voting on both important decisions, such as the Palestine vote, hurt relations between Germany and the United States?
I think there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the United States for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This signals that it must be considered an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has been very clear in its veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration has a secret understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation there, he cannot, of course, take that stand publicly.
I think the differences in opinion really aren't as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand and its position as the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what's making it hard for the Germans.
It would of course be a little easier for Germany if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
So they can't be part of the larger line and they have to push things forward from their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European attitude.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, especially with the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans understand that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a greater role.
If you look at the European crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, there's anti-German sentiment.
That doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be acceptable to all kinds of neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
The US influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is an Armani Polo?
Behind this is a trademark that is fully registered in China but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it shall enjoy protection until it is sued by the actual proprietors of the trade mark.
And even then, it's not clear if they'll get justice.
"It's getting harder and harder for foreigners to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, which specializes in infringements in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Forgers need only a few more letters to register their trademarks.
For example, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they get registered as Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied in this way.
Pattloch opens up the register with the records of the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, a fake name that also parasitizes on the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It's well known that the Chinese are the world champions in copy and copy infringement.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey shops, which sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's case is different, because he's working on behalf of his clients to prevent Chinese companies from getting a fully-official license from the trademark office to use a trademark that's already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That's women who go after rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting business, we have to fight it", Pattloch urges.
"The badge is diluted, the exclusive status is gone, the image damage is enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs to the affected industries are in the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to data from the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the deletion of questionable registrations can be difficult and costly.
The trial could go on for up to nine years with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch recounts cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because the name had become a "market reality" after a long time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
The known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer SANA, a company that had recently acquired the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why the Chinese are still allowed to use the emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled a BMW.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to the small number of staff and space.
But last year, it was reported that "working conditions returned to normal from a state of emergency".
For example, the number of unresolved objection proceedings decreased by 22%.
57,000 of these cases were closed, a 75 percent increase over the previous year.
Yet the Bureau still has 81,500 complaints pending.
It's expensive to do anything about it.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trade mark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
That's a record, and it means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the 10th time in a row.
This is also true of the total number of trademarks in force - there are 5.5 million.
In 2011, fees amounted to 1,8 billion yuan.
Simply put, this means that each application costs an average of 1,280 yuan, or $160.
The costs of bringing a case against this are many times greater, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for over seven years.
The Germans did, however, get his illegal production of imitation automobile parts banned.
However, the counterfeiter secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand to continue.
We would forget this ourselves, because in Germany surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO then rejected the objection of the Munich company.
Freudenberg won two other cases, but the case continues to this day.
You have to be very careful
Now the matter is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident the case will lead to a happy ending and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he adds: "It is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves".
The internal costs are incalculable, and the company's archives even had to go through a hundred-year-old files to produce evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered a 'high six-figure euro amount' to the counterparty to settle the dispute.
"You can see what this means for us", says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East threatens to reach Europe.
That's if the impersonators get their unprotected trademarks.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to apply for the Freudenberg mark in Germany for footwear and leather.
The group has long since abandoned this business line, but has nevertheless managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
He and Attorney Pattloch are advising German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
Rather than relying on international trademark rights, foreigners should "apply in China for anything worth protecting in any way", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the trademark in the last act of its drama, it will probably have to pay royalties to the other party for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: the knocking, the singing, the helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is trying out - and in Swaziland, orphans whose parents have died of AIDS are rejoicing.
A story of connection that spans far more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, there's the stomping: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, women's boots and men's moccasins search the floor for a beat and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly rise, urging, moaning, and chasing each other.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopf, almost lifts it off his textile shoes as he joins the voices with his wildly drawing gestures.
It's Monday night, and the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song in the Music Hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
It came to 50 male and female singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human geneticist to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each chorus has a different lyrics, and what's more, it is in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
The United Nations AIDS program estimates that some 34 million people worldwide are living with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans whose parents have died of AIDS.
HIV is now over 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans whose parents died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found a patron in the village of Esitjeni in Germany.
70 of them are in secondary school.
You can take over the patronage for 15 or 20 euros a month.
He guarantees the child a school uniform and a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story teller" or "glorifier" in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak fluent Bantu, only sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, sometimes even bringing them back to their original home in South Africa.
At a distance of 5,500 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the strength of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some in simple mud huts or thatched huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents because they succumbed to HIV.
In Estes, you can see in small ways what ailing Swaziland is: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and it's not uncommon for them to die before they're 30.
The village was discovered by the congregation during a trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a formal education, they have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was a private initiative, which allowed a child to go to school and to have one hot meal a day for a few euros a year.
But just a year later, the Voices for Africa choir was formed, and since then, it has been caring for orphans whose parents have died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious STDs?
Bacterial IBS includes syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs include HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The flea and the scabies are parasitic SPIs.
Who are the most affected?
Syphilis and gout are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gout and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively rare among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
And we have a high incidence of human papillomaviruses among teenagers.
How's the infection rate been?
Not all STDs need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulty urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100 percent protection.
Because sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted in part by infection from uncleanness and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially in cases of frequent sexual switching.
If diagnosed early, most SPIs can be cured and their consequences prevented.
Through patronage, charitable donations, and, last but not least, the fees the choir earns from singing throughout Germany, some money is raised.
"In all, we have already sent some EUR 200 000 to Esztergom", says Annette Lennartz, the association's president.
The money from Germany is managed in the village itself by Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
He also makes sure that orphans find shelter, such as with one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu call old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken in 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads, and making sure that the children arrive at school on time in uniform each day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter of Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Voices for Africa also started a sewing school, built two chicken coop, and worked with the American Public Health Organization to get many people in the village tested for HIV.
It's not a given, but even though the disease is so obvious across the country, everyone is silent about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Quite strange, in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his restless lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This government-approved lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But so did many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
The culture is different - unprotected sex".
To promote at least a little cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two to three years across southern Africa, singing songs of grief, struggle, hope for the future and black self-confidence that many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black language - an award that not only brings joy and cheerfulness but has already brought tears to the eyes of many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esztergom, where the singers visit the children they have in their care.
Although this village is hard to find on maps, it is well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esztergom, there is light", the people there say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers from here, to the singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see that light is still shining here.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury.
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also contains frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice sheet in this region of the planet that lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least a foot long and perhaps as strong as 65 feet [20 m].
This water seems to have come from comets or perhaps even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not link the ice find to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of the Messenger scientists, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help us to understand how water and other basic elements of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix, unseen by Earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth, a little window into the infinite.
The image is from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a planet, according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition of the term.
This snippet from the Spitzer Telescope's infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars, the oldest of which look like blue dots, the less identifiable pink "newborns" in the star's birth chamber.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This shifting heat from dying stars was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The star's fin ring is made of material that the star shed during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are being formed from gas and dust.
The image of the galactic "cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters", are visible at night with the naked eye.
But the telescope makes the colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may appear to the observer in this infrared image as a red eye.
It's located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the Earth's continent has earned it the name North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography creates an unusual coloration.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture this "baby" in its full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the greatest mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it's the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble Space Telescope: a whirlpool galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies are truly works of art because of their color.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula, several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (three-parted, triclinic) because dark streaks of dust divide the searing heart of this stellar birthplace into three parts.
In the constellation Hadron, astronomers have photographed the harbinger of cosmic collisions: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are slamming into each other and must inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can call her the Southern Wind.
A Hubble Space Telescope image shows a slice of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
This 1,400 light-years away nebula is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars is always giving rise to new growths.
This star cloud, also linked to the Rosetta Nebula, is still giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who preceded Galileo in using it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are ever deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
There's a Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, USA.
It allows us to peer into space with two mirrors, each measuring 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, on one of the Canary Islands, La Palma, is enormous, with a mirror alone measuring some 33 feet [10.4 m] in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet, its diameter is about 35 feet [11 m].
The disadvantage of the low-cost design: the telescope is secured by a hook at an angle of height, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light flux.
This is equivalent to the world's largest mirror telescopes, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror.
Using the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists search space for signals from extraterrestrials.
This radio telescope is 1,000 feet in diameter.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - anyone with a computer can help by making its computing power available.
View of the observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It's home to the Very Large Telescope, and it lives up to its name.
This telescope, with a total of four mirrors, can illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum.
A European ultra-large telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror is to be a full 42 meters and to be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
The images can be expected in 2018 at the earliest.
The two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into space with the Subaru Telescope and IRTTF.
A new giant telescope - a 100-foot-diameter mirror - is also being built on Mauna Kea.
You can see it in the picture.
But the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most powerful insight into the universe.
He's been providing images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The image shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board the Ariane 5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space-based infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are assuming that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
But there's no reliable data for that, because Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have indicated that Mercury has ice for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day and you'll live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the Biblical age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the Biblical age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Riding the Talish Mountains is wildly romantic.
A microbus squeaks along the road with many turns along dense forested hills, raging rivers, and simple country buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, almost like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the far south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The Talish, a Caucasian ethnic group, live here, about whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and live to a very old age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This little town boasts too much monumental Soviet-era architecture to fit in with the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Getting from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours to cover 200 miles [323] because the road is only one-way.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to the oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will be hosting the world's oldest people's festival here next year", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the lives of nearly eight dozen Talysh people from the surrounding area, who are over a hundred years old, are documented.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had a child.
The controversial star of the museum, however, is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to be 168 years old.
But there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems highly questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973", explains Fatulayev.
This man was said to have been married three times and to have had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he had a daughter.
So, was not Şirali Müslümov wrong about his age by a few decades?
But even Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also remarkably large numbers of elderly people in some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley of Pakistan", says Scholz, "and also in Sardinia, where there are extremely large numbers of very old men".
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is that people in the area around Leric live to a remarkable age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The museum's director, Fatulyeva, believes it is nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy does not seem to be very bromatological.
In Cengemiranan, a small village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzaev.
At 97 years old, she's still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a butterfly she's rocking tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are longtime grandparents.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests and served in typical armada-style belly glasses.
Mirzaeva's white teeth line up perfectly, and under her scarf is a long dark blonde copy, proudly unveiled by her son.
I always washed my hair with milk so it didn't look bad and kept its color.
"I've never used shampoo either", says Mirzaeva.
A month's pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what came from her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I've never bought groceries in my life.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But things improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
Propaganda sounds strange coming from an old woman.
But the cult of the father of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzaev receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (about the same in euros), which is a good living for the locals.
And perhaps Mirzaiva's long-grayed-out son is right: "The elderly are highly esteemed in our culture".
They live in the midst of a large family, loved, cared for, and happy.
Unless it's a reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The concept of "human rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The unrest in Cairo has exposed the deep divisions in the country.
There is a heated debate about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president has spared no expense.
We need to create a passage.
"And I am responsible for our success, before people and before God", he said on state television.
His address was addressed to the entire nation, but especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular persons.
All those who have so far been hopelessly torn between confused opposition are afraid.
Fear of a "God state" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apologetically announced that he had temporarily limited the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, really wants to save is unclear to the Egyptians and the world.
Should the judiciary be stripped of its power?
The 234 paragraphs that the Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly hastily passed in a 15-hour night marathon are partly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, this proposal states that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and one fears that Islamists will use this vague wording and the legal leeway it affords to interpret Sharia more strictly.
At least, this is illustrated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters concerning Sharia, one should consult with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on all Sunni Islam.
This may not mean that the clergy will oversee the legislation, but it may mean that the judiciary will be effectively disenfranchised.
There are many things to be interpreted in the draft constitution.
The problem is also that the civilian jurisdiction of military courts must continue to be maintained.
These courts were used by the Mubarak government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The proposal also states that the state should protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values".
This is so imprecise in legal terms that the article could even allow the state institutions to control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, it means nothing but censorship.
In fact, no paragraph in the text explicitly defines equality between men and women.
Another paragraph, however, forbids defaming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his emissaries.
But it remains unclear what defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally questionable to say that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke on legal experts enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and which he says he will present to the Egyptians for a popular vote "very soon".
"The revolution is back"
For weeks, opposition has been building against the Islamist overwhelming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unison in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday night, vowing to destroy the constitution before it takes effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbah, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, said that the draft constitution belongs "to the dustbin of history".
He accused Morsi's supporters of planning a "coup against democracy" via Twitter.
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition member Yasir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished", said opposition politician Khalid Ali, quoted by Egyptian media.
Several judges have announced they will not oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution".
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood announced a defiance demonstration, but out of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile outside Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafist supporters joined in, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They called on Morsi to "cleanse the land" and assured him, "The Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square where it all began would probably trigger a situation akin to civil war.
Morsi's supporters clearly didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which way the country should go.
The majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered to be certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which is actually supposed to continue until February and integrate all social forces, is dividing Hafiz Abu Sa'du.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) has defended Muslim Brotherhood members when they were in jail or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because he believed human rights were inseparable.
For this, he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And the new constitution now does not have the words 'human rights' once", he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three branches of government forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it", complains Sa'da.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the battle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could get even.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control".
Norway shrimp: The world's most stinking fish?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for extremely stinky fish?
Have some overripe cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
So you get the paralyzing smell of rackfish, one of Norway's greatest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a beautiful view, and a pervasive smell hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is boiled in water for up to a year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, how to say, most seductive food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavita", says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for running the festival.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to shrimp", says Havard.
The drink can outweigh the smell.
I'll try a few.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a slice of sushi that was on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when Norway was poor and, because there were no refrigerators, fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they came out and ate - no doubt numbed by alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mostly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - over 13% are immigrants attracted by the large amount of work, high wages and extensive care system.
People from Sweden, an old rival that was much richer than Norway until recently, are flocking to the country for work.
Rakfisk is seen as an important, indispensable, if rather stinking, part of Norway's past.
It's one of the more expensive foods on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) a piece.
Norway often gets away from the world news - and most people seem to be fine with that.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still being mentioned here with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is being called the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country, one of their own could be capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway's current wealth is due to the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970's.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents the prototype of Nordic prosperity, as she serves plates of shrimp.
We are, as you say, sensible people.
Her English, like most people's English here, is perfect.
We don't like to show off. We don't like ostentation.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - except for a small percentage, most of the money from the sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While everyone else was throwing away money they didn't have in the years leading up to the global financial crash, the Norwegians had their wallets tightly tied.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And eat shrimp", he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of the rack.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is back.
The hotel I stay in is one of many places where shrimp is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most tasteful, fish.
They're connected to a live TV broadcast in which the host is a butterfly surrounded by a plate of shrimp.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Howard".
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, possibly intoxicated with aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a rough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city that is jammed even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected blocking several key routes into the capital, causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf and assume leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been doing well economically under outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My administration has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto had gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views of the new leader are even differing in his old homeland, a populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in a positive way.
The citizens credit him with developing tourism in the resort and building up the infrastructure.
The city is now accessible by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto built, a huge improvement over the bumpy roads that used to be there.
His name is also displayed on the walls of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to bring real and lasting change", says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state legislator for President Pena Nieto's Institutionalized Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We especially hope for the exciting and real changes in security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years of uninterrupted rule, the PRI was ousted by Vincent Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are high expectations from Enrique Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects opposition statements characterizing the new president as a man without substance.
He's a very straightforward man, very concerned with the country's excellent vision.
He's a great statesman and, most importantly, a good listener.
But on the other side of the state, that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more evident.
Stuck under the freeway overpasses, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help deal with drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly the violence against women.
In the past two years alone, dozens of murdered women's bodies have been dumped in empty places next to a huge garbage dump.
During the time that Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the issue of female murder during his time in office.
And at worst, they accuse his leadership of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house typical of a run-down neighborhood, Irineia Buendia shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses tears.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes her partner killed her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been washed", recalls Mrs. Buendia.
He had bruising marks and he was starting to go into post-mortem.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from a picture on the wall, right next to a cross that has only one word on it: "Justice".
However, this is, according to the family, exactly what they were denied.
The government authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions", he says.
The Sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday comes with a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new president has promised that they will be his top priority while he's in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor", says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has no complaints of ill-treatment, says the military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims of mistreatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's time in military custody at Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds of Manning's treatment in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein, in cross-examining Private Manning at a preliminary hearing at Fort Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during his nine months in custody at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing on the defense's motion to dismiss the case against Manning for aggravated battery while in custody, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then posted online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of their information.
At Friday's hearing, Military Prosecutor Fein reviewed with Manning the forms the officers filled out after meeting with Manning at Quantico Detention Center, where he was held in high security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When asked by Fein about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even though Manning's officers directly asked him how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems orally and that officers who visited him had discussed those concerns with him and indicated that they would be addressed, but did not record them.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them", Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in January 2011 when he met with a committee reviewing suicidal thoughts he had expressed on the form several months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The army stated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree below the suicide surveillance regime) for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the prison guards to know that I was fine and that I wanted to end this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy an increased quality of life as I saw it", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transportation to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to the detention facility at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was in Kuwait, considering suicide, and he passed out in the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the world around him was very depressing.
"My world has shrunk to just Arifjan base, to that cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that upon arrival at Quantico, he spent most of the day (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell with no company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, a duvet, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against regulations.
Manning said he always slept with a light from outside the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned over at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the allegations he made in his testimony Thursday that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell at Quantico, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket during the count.
In Friday's hearing, Judge Manning said that he had been ordered by his guards to remove a blanket that would have covered him, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to remove it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his shoulder strap to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his shoelaces and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and will significantly reduce his sentence if he is convicted before a military court, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser charges and fight the other charges because they're too extreme.
The trial is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the conditions of detention as justified.
The Pentagon issued a statement saying Manning was being held in accordance with regulations for all detainees being held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally making intelligence documents available on the Internet, transmitting information of national security concern, and theft of public property or records.
If he's convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life.
My crisis of Mexican-American identity
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who leave; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely got through the crowd and I got to the immigration agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, same as my friends in Boston calling themselves "Irish" and my friends in New York calling themselves "Italians".
So later I ended up with the label "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of a conversation in that language.
But I don't have a native speaker vocabulary and I can't shake the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment this week when the newly elected Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House.
The agenda included the usual topics discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has promised to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though he has provided no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders, at gunpoint, to cede half of Mexico to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are ubiquitous.
So the minute a U.S. official says something even slightly critical of Mexico, you hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about how the Americans are interfering in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will step onto the path of war.
And yet the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostility?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person matched the profile -- dark skin, poor education, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream now, going to good schools and having good jobs, we can never forget the fact that we're living the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may be vague at times, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we know that many of the elite Mexican ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a humiliating reminder of defeat and they look at us as an inferior race that isn't Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their view, is nothing but failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they never would have left him.
And we would not now be trapped behind the silk curtain, with the good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand who they are more, and Mexican Americans don't like to carry that.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, a lot of Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, they look at us like we're Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to complicate matters even more, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "temporary ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country, and we should push political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well, you know.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are unsure if this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel resentment for the way their family members were treated in a much more recent past.
I'm not going to.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such failure is futile.
Amid the usual wild guesses about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis, and for the first time rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even as Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their longstanding conflict, the Middle East around them is changing.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are caught up in the chaos that has engulfed the region.
It may make their fight bloodier than ever.
However, there is reason to believe that this may break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism at present.
Even if the ceasefire of November 21st holds, this week's fighting has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim that they forced the Israelis to withdraw even though Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the imprisonment of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most deplorable and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its staunch rivals in Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
And the leaders of Hamas may well know that time is on their side.
Islamists gained more influence throughout the Arab world, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Hamas boasters say the Islamic crescent is spreading around Israel, north from Lebanon, where Hezbollah is in power, through Syria, where the rebels, increasingly leaning towards Islamism, can overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, in the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the most important Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that neither Israel nor America can rule out.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system has proven its worth and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, in part thanks to the wall that encircles the West Bank, the heart of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined forces with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil these traitorous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be launching rockets like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we keep them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
While the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than the spending of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Morsi has been working with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and could signal the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should have a long-term view of the situation.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are making this situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody raids on Gaza, which are held every few years to suppress Hamas, will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need outside encouragement.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers are saying: two states, where Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that the ceasefire will give outside pressure at least a little more leverage in enforcing this cause.
Egypt, which must work with Turkey and Qatar to stop arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders in exchange for a piece of land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arab outside must also push for a compromise between Hamas and Fatah.
That would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has his part to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to step in.
That's pathetically short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
It means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia's ugly cigarette packaging laws go into effect
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, display warnings for smokers and diseased body parts.
Australia's ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws, the first of their kind in the world, have been enacted, and the logo and brand colors have been replaced by ubiquitous olive-green boxes with hideous images of diseased body parts and images of children and newborns who have fallen ill as a result of their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes are the brand names, which are printed in the same small print.
It is the most stringent regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by making the habit less appealing.
He relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by age 26, there's a 99 percent chance they'll never start.
"Even very young children can be shown to understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell along with their product", says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that show, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"This legislation will have serious unintended consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in many more of these products to be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others claim that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover foul-smelling boxes rose from near-zero sales two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their lawsuits to the Australian Supreme Court.
Ha said that Zico has sold almost 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible obstacle, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events, and requiring most vendors to hide cigarettes from view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a tobacco marketer and you have this little space to promote your products, online is the place to be", says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in brand ratings on social media sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to handle the new regulations rather than on marketing.
The retaliation has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unfairly restricted even though none of them trade significantly with Australia.
The decision of the SOA is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now they have spread to over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
I'm not affected by pictures.
I just ignore them.
"You just take out a cigarette and you put the box back in", says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason I'm gonna quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it harder for him to fit them on the shelves.
"It took me an hour to unload, now it takes me four hours", Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we'll close the shop,'" he said, waving his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
On the last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite being distracted by books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and child development experts increasingly praise boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And because most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of getting bored.
So should we encourage boredom?
- I know.
And no, you didn't.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that happened with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of Boredom: A Lively History, says (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history", he said.
A Latin inscription on the walls of Pompeii, dating from the first century C.E., was found to be about boredom.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to do something that would satisfy me, but not being able to".
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything but wants to be.
He says that in apathy, there's no compulsion to do anything.
He says that the root of boredom is "the disruption of the attentional process, which is associated with a bad mood and a sense of slow-moving time".
Boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, whereas people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while a third group heard it at all.
Those who listened silently to the TV program reported greater boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating but were unsure why and attributed the trouble to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, distracted attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, if you are doing something boring, "like finding faulty parts on a production line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored".
In fact, he said, we now know that twitching and purring, which are often seen as signs of boredom, can actually help combat boredom and keep people more physically alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to roam learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom at times - a delayed flight, a loudspeaker, a particularly long movie.
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980's.
The scale includes questions such as "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests I don't have time to do them all".
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimulation.
But teenagers are generally inattentive.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven or eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported being bored outside of school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "adolescence is the peak of boredom", which is largely due to children and teens not being given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?"
Research shows that sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take ridiculous physical risks, to gamble, or to abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have debated the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the right thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, you'll enjoy it.
But watching TV will only bring you short-term pleasure, not long-term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he's not bored anymore, but he's not learning how to play or drive on his own, Professor Fenske said.
And "this self-control is transferred from one situation to another", the professor said.
Not only will your child learn to be entertained but he will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we're out of reach of the constant rush of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood has agreed.
"We accuse it of needing to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful", he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated", he said, "it is difficult to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise is turned off".
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high school student and football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for what will soon be legal statewide - possession of several grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said he was driving with some friends in Lamar one day in September, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - misdemeanors that each carry a $100 fine - and was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals", said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the answer to hundreds of minor drug cases hangs more on the ground than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offenses have already been dropped here and in Washington state, which has passed similar measures.
The police department has stopped charging adults 21 and older for possession of small amounts, which will be legally allowed once the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado counties have said they'll continue to pursue existing marijuana cases, and still charge people with possession.
Meanwhile, several cities in the Denver suburbs heading west toward the mountains are voting to block the opening of new state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
"This is a case that is moving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The regulators in Washington State are also shaking their heads.
And they're looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent we can follow", he said.
The Washington law, known as I-502, goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a one-year vacuum during which there will still be no state licensing system, but legal possession will.
And there are some complicated mechanical issues that need to be addressed during this time, such as how to balance the state's directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on the sale of cannabis within 330 yards of schools, parks, playgrounds or day centers.
"Nowhere will it be harder to establish a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offenses for possession of small amounts of marijuana on any citizen over the age of 21 and that police would stop charging people for these crimes "with immediate effect".
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck is taking a more aggressive view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many face additional charges.
"Our office is obligated to prosecute crimes that were crimes at the time they were committed", Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The reaction has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters have rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults with possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but he also decided not to dismiss all ongoing possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and legal system will never be easy.
And the mixed reactions across the state to this big state green experiment have revealed a deep divide among local officials.
For district attorneys, it's a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana possession defendants and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal", he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are well on their way to becoming national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new limits on legalized sales while anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still plans to make the sale and cultivation of marijuana a federal crime.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana are hoping the Justice Department will cave in.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients, the federal government has largely allowed medical marijuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to operate.
While drug agents are unlikely to break down doors to intercept a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana businesses to be allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal action.
Ahead of election day, some local governments have approved moratoriums on any new marijuana businesses, although it will be another year or so before any can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the western part of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it's likely to go into effect next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we give someone a license and then it becomes a big federal issue", said City Councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative".
It's not just college students today who are being attacked for their beliefs.
I can't remember a time when I didn't dream of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother went to what I thought was the world's greatest center of learning, a modern Greek symposium that encouraged the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And yet, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of entering Worcester College, where I was going to study history, I packed my bags and plunged into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I gave it up because I objected to making love to students in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson bluntly stated that I left because I was forced to drink from beaten cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the object of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative.
You may be wondering why I'm bringing this up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right of center are suffering similar harassment.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded equal rights protection for gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior College Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and made to feel unwelcome".
They're asking for a position on the university's equal opportunity committee to ensure they can express their views freely.
Not helped by their plight was a recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student politics, which conservatives portrayed as weird and neo-Nazi.
The programme featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, wore a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are being treated as "victims" because of the higher tuition.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "left influence is growing in the universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us".
Twenty-one-year-old Corpus Christi history student Samuel Roberts, who is behind the more conservative movement, says the climate is "unpleasant", while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in JCR members' attitude toward people on the right of the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion as well as to the well-being of members", he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was one member outnumbered.
I joined in September 1986, aged 18, and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refuse to award an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would make even Stalinists tremble.
During the first few days of the inaugural week, when the new students were interacting with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the diaper that was coming.
I found that not only do professors quietly approve of teasing conservative students, but they also happily participate.
The policy of mining strikes, privatization, and government resistance to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were brought to the wood-panelled auditoriums.
My first lecture was about translating an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I was having a hard time.
Professor Pitt, the little man with the face of a cake batter, was very gallant.
"Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
Tears came to my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social affairs", Professor Pitt grumbled.
I went back to my room, devastated.
I was sitting alone at dinner at school when I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a sophomore named James who identified himself as an OUCA member.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being conservative is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted I disagreed with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who went to Eton, ironically, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do conservatives make love?" one asked.
They beat each other up, didn't they?
I felt like the homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Do I have to turn into a lab tech and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me have developed into a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He was barely there.
He hated the place for its guilt and pettiness and for its propensity for a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began driving from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his time at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes grew dark.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
My friend, also a Conservative, gave in to pressure and renounced his convictions.
The following week, during class, when another history professor solemnly declared me an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Though I blushed inside with shame, I admitted that my "parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools".
The relief was only temporary.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was my father.
He wrote two columns a week for Murdoch's newspaper at the time.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a snorting weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
But even more tragic, it was Oxford that not only produced 14 Conservative prime ministers, but that still has an undeserved reputation as a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition by Valentino Garavani.
The designer confirmed this when he opened the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion", which features more than 130 high-end models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle", he says in his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but which could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and remote world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which runs until March 3, is overflowing with private correspondence and photographs signed by the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the northern Italian town of Vogher to an international "Bohemian cream" idol.
There's nothing wrong with liking royalty.
"At least they don't put a cigarette butt in a fancy carpet like some gorgeous pop star does", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
We both lived in the Alps in the '60s and '70s and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host, and he entertains his guests with grace and grace.
"We were all very happy to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad", explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star".
Valeria Mazz is performing Valentino.
The charisma of the designer is also remembered by the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been many years since we went to dinner with him after a performance in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. were among us.
In every detail of his apartment, the decorations, the food, the music, everything, he reflected and he could feel his spirit.
It made everyone feel important and loved", recalls a top model who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art", he concludes.
A parade of nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of true love in return.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been rebuilt on a distinctive seventy-meter-long passageway that offers a role-change: the visitor changes into a model and walks through the passageway to observe a dream "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces like the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Night", or the wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience, models shine with names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "you can't forget it".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, a gillette vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 fall-winter collection.
It was a gift he gave me", says Naty Abascal, one of the design muses.
"I prefer him over the others because of his femininity and his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors she uses, they brighten up and give a sparkle to her face.
The proportions are perfect".
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
She finally made it to the late '90s.
"I bought my first Valentine's dress for the occasion of the celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a skirt with a handle, a sleeve and a top without shoulders.
It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless", explains an Italian aristocrat whose life is divided between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg has arranged the designer's formal dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that they have inside".
The "King" of Fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding to Paul Greeks in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "nails" (as the designer calls his tailors) to make this ivory-colored silk dress with its pearls, 12 different types of edges, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long [4.5 m] barrel.
According to journalist Suza Menkes, a leading authority on the specialist press, the dress represents a landmark of late-20th-century high fashion, "the return of high society clientele".
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elite savoir-être, is now its best example.
Garavani, a Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and a recipient of the Legion of Honor, has accumulated as many honours as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always been attracted to his elegance, his calmness, his neatness and his perfect appearance", admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was flawless, time left no trace on him".
When the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen area
For four euros, the carriers in the Indonesian volcano area risk their lives and health as they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur down steep rocky trails.
There are people for whom their jobs are hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who earn a living mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, they must travel to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulfur gases escape from the Earth's interior and become solid when exposed to air.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, weighing up to 130 pounds [70 kg], he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It is only a quarter mile [2,386 m] to the summit of the volcano, but exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to make the tortuous ascent, balancing and carefully considering their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell from the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kawah only make five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they are up there, they fight their way past the tourists who take pictures of them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and they carry the heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining the volcano since 1960, has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since the mineral has its place in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilograms [70 lb], we earn about 46,000 rupees [US$3,500] each way", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
It takes him three hours to make one trip and he is devastated at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees a day.
Although it seems like a negligible amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wages of the miners here are very high - 15,000 rupees ($1.50) a day for coffee picking and two million rupees ($1.69) for 14 days", explains a porter who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as compelling as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, shortness of breath, constant coughing, and eyes irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, shortness of breath, constant coughing, and irritated eyes from toxic gases leaking from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French", he promises in more than a few words of English.
This charming, intelligent young man, who is doomed, could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, and instead he's doing a job as a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up at two o'clock every morning because the sulfur keeps pouring at night and its characteristic yellow color changes to blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto heads into the crater and lights his way through with a small light that he has attached to his helmet and bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry sulfur baskets from the crater floor
The Commission therefore concluded that the measures in question are not selective and that the measures in question do not distort competition and are not likely to affect trade between the Parties.
In fact, they do not even get a share of the 30,000 rupees ($1.50) extra for a photo shoot, which, along with a $15,000 ticket, is collected by the park rangers from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This is a job for cattle, not people", says Madrusin, a stout 42-year-old porter who has worked in Kawah for only three decades since leaving school.
She can lift up to 400 pounds [110 kg] and assures us that she will work "as long as possible" because she needs money to pay for the education of her three sons, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano was my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners in the thick vapours that come out of the volcano, the miners are so adamant that none of them complain of serious illness - as evidenced by their frequent breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain, and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
An eunuch who balances his basket on his back can weigh only 50 kilograms at age 53.
Each day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is then hauled by three trucks up a steep, dense road to a warehouse in Tamansari, 11 miles [18 km] away.
"I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik says, opening his mouth wide with several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five sons, now 30, also earns a living in the sulfur mine.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's toughest crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts of human mules at Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans blame not having children for their careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot, so let's fulfill our civic duty and create a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These are the words of a rapper who uses local slang like "put the pussy in the oven" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that created the video, hopes to bring attention to the problem in a humorous way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency's artistic director, says that he wanted to use the influence of music to help people fulfill "their civic duty".
"It's all about the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing our population, so we felt like this was a topic we needed to address.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like spreading pheromone perfumes or hosting dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they were not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like compose a rap, to solve this problem".
1.2 children
The one that doesn't take this too lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 a year encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides financial benefits.
All these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, technologically advanced city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative officials and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, given the distribution of population, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered the recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department of the National Population Bureau, says that this is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People have a wider range of choices when it comes to life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family", he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as part of immigration policy as a measure to counter population decline, this has caused resentment among locals.
Some Singaporean websites show open xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and making little effort to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one reason why Singapore's ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unintended Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying to keep the number of small houses down.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Office of Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments are 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that these flats may encourage a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developer EL Developers, claims that their "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, and they sell out days to weeks faster than larger homes.
So they're much better for our cash flow".
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could lead to a rise in the nation's birth rate, interviews with Singaporeans working in the city's downtown financial district suggest they won't have much effect.
"People are always under stress, housing is expensive, and education is expensive, so many people put it off", says a young official.
"Let the rest have children.
But for me, it's important to rely on my own money and time", says another, in his 20's.
Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons for not having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to force people to have children, it is Singaporeans who ultimately have the final say in family planning.
What's private offline is private online.
It's private.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something personal or "the area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any interference".
What is privacy for someone under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the danger of posting things on the Internet that he would most likely not tell anyone in normal communication?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be 'something entirely their own' at a personal level and 'username and password' when it came to social networks.
"My biggest secret is not to be told", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world", she says.
"I put nice pictures on FB or pictures of us playing.
I also talk to people I know.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that made someone laugh", he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, photographs of naked people or photographs of crimes, or to write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 of his Facebook friends and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password to one of the accounts.
"I started a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there", he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends", she says.
He says without hesitation that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
He wouldn't even care if someone referred him to someone he didn't know.
Fourteen-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace, and Ask, and on the latter, he admits that he does not know 20 people on his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music", he says.
According to this boy, none of them ever told him anything, asked for his address or phone number.
"If they press me or demand that I do it, I simply delete them from my account", she admits.
Jose signed up for Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
These boys are no strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was", he confirms.
According to Jose, the victim never logged out of the account.
"You just activated private mode".
Then it explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would post pictures of people he knows in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if I was in trouble or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate student in Education, believes that for children and teens to navigate social media well, they need to understand that the main purpose of social media is to inform.
He says: "The Internet began as a means of finding information, but the advent of social media changed the rules of the game".
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate student in education at Yale University and author of Digital Aborigines and Digital Immigrants, introduced these terms to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born in this technology era.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are learning ourselves", he says.
He explains that it is a difficult subject "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ready for it".
Also, to be considerate of others at a time when their greatest desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, and not to think about the consequences".
She says that the most effective way to teach children and teenagers about privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work", he adds.
Marrielos Porras goes on to list some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, "Would you like someone to post your picture the way you posted your friend's?"
Do you know what other people are saying about you?
When you tag people in party photos, did you ask those people for permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to make them realize that they have to behave in an online environment as well as offline.
It's the same rules.
"Offline, respect, morality and other principles govern a person, and the same should apply to social media", he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary school teacher, and an educational consultant, explains that it is essential for parents to read carefully the rules of social networking.
"If they understand the insidiousness of each one, they have a good basis for discussing the consequences of setting up an Internet account with their children.
For example, about age or what is allowed to share or publish", he says.
Guardia feels that it is important to remind children of the traditional rule "don't talk to strangers".
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration is not published.
The sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru ended today without the issuance of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the sixth UNASUR summit, but officials from the Foreign Ministry and the presidential office, who initially said they would release the document after the summit, said it would be posted later on the Peruvian government's website.
They further stated that the content was made public by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists were restricted in their access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential meeting was broadcast in the press room without sound with the message "confidential meeting, audio transmission blocked".
The limited information available to journalists was provided by the press representatives of some governments present, but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of the presidents participating, which provoked the anger of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an email to the media with a "concluding statement" from the summit, but it was only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even then the Lima Declaration, originally promised, was not published, despite press calls.
The official website of ASPA says that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure broadcasts for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing defense testimony from both sides on Monday to address the dispute that Lima launched against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute the judgment that resolves the dispute that we are hearing today in this international court", said President Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts", Piñera added, greeting President Humalu with a handshake of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents to submit to the International Court of Justice's ruling came after Colombia this week adopted the Bogota Pact, expressing its submission to the rulings of the international court that ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which Colombia considered to be entirely flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was given the task of opening the morning's speeches and closing the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, which announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects were planned between the South American countries, with investments totaling $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the member countries of UNASUR would take 'important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended'.
He said that actions were being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil unrest and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all parts of South America, and to jointly and effectively respond to the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation [in Latin America] should not be a victorious force, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future", Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport connectivity in different parts of South America, especially rural and border areas... to better connect our countries and create new economic ties", the Peruvian president said in a speech read out.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and its trans-boundary axes from the coast to Brazil, and two others concern better connectivity with Ecuador, but did not elaborate.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return her to the Union of South American Nations", from which she is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted at the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region, one that is integrated and has good neighbourly relations.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to discuss respectfully the International Court of Justice's ruling on the maritime border dispute disputed by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)", Santos said.
'We will discuss all solutions, none excluded, including a treaty with Nicaragua that requires negotiations with that country,' he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
The Summit held a preliminary meeting of Union Defence Ministers to adopt an Action Plan for 2013 to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chair of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe on integration
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, really, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told state-run TV Perú that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which is supported by the member countries of Unasur.
"We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which is already taking place between the members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of backwardness that want to take us back to the past", he said.
Among other things, the Ecuadorian president said he agreed to the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision, because it did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time, 'there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing trial'.
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary for asking him to be interrogated on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, whereas 'Sweden's own legislation allows for the interrogation to be conducted by videoconference call, which could be conducted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London'.
Correa stated that there was a risk of Assange's physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I have not spoken to him since he has been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a minor lung problem, but nothing serious", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental health are in danger of deteriorating because he is confined to a small space with no access to fresh air.
It would affect everyone's health", he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that talks were under way with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We don't negotiate on human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there were constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings before different European bodies", he said.
He said that "if Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over".
And if Sweden can question Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as is allowed by the law there and has been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be solved".
Correa used the situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, making it clear that he would not tolerate "subversion, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of a free press are not us, the mean and depraved politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail", he said.
In this regard, he expressed joy that neither such journalists, "nor bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor bourgeoisie rule Ecuador", and predicted that if re-elected, "he will continue to carry out changes in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue maintaining Paraguay's veto on UNASUR membership at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état disguised as legality" because in fact "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also said that he considered "absolutely appropriate" the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries now, in the wake of the International Court of Justice ruling in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently admissible.
"It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly to overcome them and to be able to move forward".
He also expressed hope that the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile would be settled in the same court, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international jurisdiction if both countries commit to accepting the judgment, however harsh".
Regarding the possibility of running for a third term in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, he noted that he views the possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has stated that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
"I have never personally been interested in power, but unjust situations like the socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility", he said.
"If I win, it will be my last presidential term and then I will retire from politics.
If we lose, I'll lose the same.
I've made my decision", he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chávez has left for a scheduled routine medical treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It is not a relapse in the president's health", he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador today attended the sixth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like being struck by lightning", he recalls, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor tried to "soften up a little bit", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on himself and started to educate himself about it, and he did so with such dedication that he celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the longest-serving patients in the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he joined in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since he was 22, which was unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him "because he had a cut".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it's possible to live with this syndrome and live fully.
However, many people do not know they are sick and only come when the virus has destroyed their body and weakened their immune system, and then they fall victim to accidental infections.
Thirty-one years after the AIDS epidemic began, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great achievement that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment on time and in an appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara, adding that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious diseases specialist Andrade Villanueva, who specializes in HIV/AIDS, explained that as of 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of damage to the immune system of the patients diagnosed, with those who do not use drugs doing better: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and those with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can, according to this study, "live safely for up to 75 years if treated", the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS deaths has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of AIDS patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 as of May this year, but since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured.
Why do people still die from the disease?
"I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it is at my hospital.
The problem is that patients come in at a very advanced stage because they don't know the status of the disease, which is late in the disease".
It adds the compelling figure: "Nine out of ten patients come with a co-infection, and the only way to increase overall mortality is to diagnose the disease early, so that screening is widely available to all who ask for it".
His proposal is in line with the specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tested in a private lab just because his friend did, and despite his young age, he already had AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer disease that is one of the common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather deal with it three times a week", they say, but that's not my case.
The change has been for the better, I'm eating healthy, exercising, taking medication".
To this day, his parents only know that he had cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person", says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today on World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they've taken the risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, that's better. And if they've been diagnosed, let them know that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible".
This message sums up the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms at the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara who researches HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that do this, "the condom distribution has really increased, from one or two condoms to hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who don't have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"What do you want?" is a common question filled with irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers, and health-care workers that teens want to avoid, says a reporter.
He proposed to change this inefficient distribution, to make condoms not just on the counter, but in the 100 dispensers in public restrooms, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
Nor is it "paying for beer and motel", as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if he would approve of distributing condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex", he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This makes it the fourth-largest state in Mexico in terms of new and confirmed AIDS cases and the 13th-largest in terms of HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that some 50,000 people may be living with HIV, with four to five people unaware of the disease for every one recorded.
The judgment upheld by the US Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt resulting from the bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
The restructuring procedures that are permitted by Mexican law do not seem to be applicable in the Land of the Stars and Stripes, despite international agreements.
The approval of a ruling issued on June 15th of last year by Judge Harlin Hall of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies practically without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their assets across the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for the major Mexican glass manufacturer to appeal three irregularities to the United States Supreme Court.
It should be noted, first, that while the judge in this case claims that creditors are to be governed by United States insolvency law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main procedure is to set up bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would indicate a lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in the insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, designating the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without a vote by the branches from the internal corporate structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican law allows for this possibility.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
Moreover, even after the branches' votes had been counted, the creditors who had sued Vitro in the United States, i.e. the 'vulture' funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
In the vote, it would be about 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal disregards this.
On the other hand, the Court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the severe economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm of González Sady will appeal the re-examination directly to the Court of Appeal, so that the review will be conducted with full participation, that is, with the participation of five judges, because originally only three voted.
If he fails here, he will seek a review of the case at a higher level, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
The Court of First Instance, in its judgment of 12 December 2012, found that the Commission had failed to fulfil its obligations under the United States Bankruptcy Code by failing to adopt the necessary measures to comply with the requirements of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
It also points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
A blow to both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
The overall assessment
For months, the Mexican aviation unions had been lying on the table with a criminal complaint against former Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, a former owner of the company, who was accused of fraud, and the union says the tank had already overflowed.
A court led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, accusing them of obstruction of justice.
According to the Commission, the Office of the Auditor General systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which he collected 198 million pesos from the IXE bank of Fideicomiso F/589 on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares in the Hotel Professional Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mar
A group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens met at the Universidad de Caribe campus over the weekend to approve the creation of an association to prevent the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a huge commercial and distribution center with products from the "land of the great wall" targeting Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees of 150 companies at the bottom.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has already managed to unite the governors of the south-east zone to oppose a monumental site that would have partly devastated protected areas and that is the origin of all resistance to industry.
The ACTA document is over
The Senate's request, which the government did not consider, and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known in English by its acronym ACTA, has become outdated, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As you know, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, Homex, a developer, is putting 500 million pesos worth of investment certificates on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer interest repayments every 28 days.
Competitive is born
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has created an association with the trade name Competival, which will target the software services market in Central and South America.
The investment in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
World champion basketball player Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in the sport for more than 60 years, traveling the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of their local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was a fixture in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a National Basketball League player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón of the National Basketball League, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I have held many positions in my life in basketball, including several simultaneously, such as being president of the National Basketball League (BSN) in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and president of the federation", Reyes recalled when visiting reporters at the Primera Hora newspaper at his home in Bayamon, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house, almost all of which are decorated with photos and memorabilia from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest of all movements, he guards those that recall his tenure with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to play with the Los Vaqueros since 1967 and win eight championships, either as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship-- in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
"The team was then taken over by 'Cuco' Ortiz, who was an excellent leader", Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was the former coach here at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me, 'I have a six-foot-tall player for you.
You want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brought Bayamon a championship win, then Gausse would contribute to the next one".
Gausse enjoyed the championship while playing for the Los Vaqueros, but only remotely, as he was already acting president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At the time, he wanted to focus on his duties and enjoy Mincy's place on the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the Olympic qualifiers in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have won bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final toss", Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was pretty similar to the one that took us bronze at the World Championships.
This team not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramón Rivas, Fica López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had the perfect lineup but was able to win the gold medal and bring us great joy was the 1995 Olympic qualifying team in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players eliminated by a brawl at the Mar de Plata Pan American Games, we won gold against all odds.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
It was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers in international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved the results of Piculin at this level.
Not to mention his involvement in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which included Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work very much.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?
That I was part of the most glorious era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early '90s, the National League of BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What didn't you get to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
Like Ponce boys playing only in their area and only competing against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Kids travel a lot now and play too many games, which isn't necessary.
I also see the benefit of compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad to hear it.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos of music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". on the television series Dallas, in which he played a man who acted recklessly and was sly and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new series Dallas, died Friday afternoon from complications related to cancer, according to an official family statement provided to The Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas to reprise the iconic role he loved most", his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas with him for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who played Hagman's wife in both the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death in a Dallas hospital", her agent Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest", said Linda Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before Dallas aired, Hagman made his name on television as the good guy in the light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which ran on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to his home to live with.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film appearances included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that brought him to the top of the stars.
A CBS drama series about the Ewings and other figures around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Jair?" was intended to create anticipation for an emotional piece where the Hangman character is nearly murdered, and not only caused a huge amount of speculation from viewers around the world, but also risked millions of dollars at the box office.
That also helped the show to break the record for viewership.
The November 1980 episode, which revealed the answer, averaged 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most-watched entertainment program in history after MASH, which ended its run in 1983 with 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin got pregnant with J.R. and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had a reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a cunning businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, committed to a mental institution.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his tombstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the one thing he didn't do.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of fans around the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new series Dallas aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second series have been completed and a sixth is in production", the network reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner Bros. or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, Ben Hagman, a lawyer.
In the early 1950's, Larry tried his luck on the New York stage, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm anyone", he told the Associated Press at the time.
After a liver transplant, he became involved in organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to help fearful patients.
"I counsel them, I encourage them, I see them when they go into surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of, "Don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be fine".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
A course exploring "the end of the world" begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew that the temptation was insurmountable: The end of the "long count" of the Mayan calendar, which was to come on December 21, was taken by many as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what lay ahead in the months to come: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget deficit that some call "debt Armageddon", and the escalating conflict engulfing Israel, the place where, according to doomsday theorists, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If you look at what's happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad is good for the apocalyptic.
And he's not the only professor who's offering a course on the "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Vacker is teaching a course on "Means, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas spread over time", he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what was possible, probable, believable and impossible", says Vacker.
On the main campus of Penn State, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to run a course simply titled End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' because we always count on the possibility of re-scheduling the course if the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must study, create projects, and take final exams.
Penn State's final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very evening of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It spread out over two hours", Restall said of his course for high-school students, who enrolled 35.
Weeks and weeks before the semester started, we got emails asking if there was a vacancy.
The students themselves assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
So apocalyptic, secular, religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he's seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a classroom where this could be taught", he said.
"I'm enjoying this".
But no student interviewed, let alone the professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prediction, and we're kind of disproving it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar", Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back centuries, where people respond to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has given rise to this speculation.
"Nowhere else do people think about it", he said.
This is the case in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
When asked if Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, knew of a course there on "the end of the world", he quickly responded.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world", he wrote, suggesting an exception for the highest office.
We have a mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that there had been many talk of doomsdays over the years, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors alike.
A few said they were planning to go to the "end of the world" celebration.
"I think I'll call a few friends and have a laugh", explained 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
