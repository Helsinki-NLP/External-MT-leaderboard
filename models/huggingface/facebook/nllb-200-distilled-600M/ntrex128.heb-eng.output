Members of the Welsh parliament are afraid to look like puppets.
Some MPs were concerned about the proposal that their job title would change from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern was raised by plans to change the name of the House of Commons to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this will invite celebration.
A Labour MP said his people feared it would be a strain on the Twp and the Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means kinky.
A member of parliament from the Flemish Camry Party said all his members were dissatisfied and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his members were open to proposals for a name change, but noted that the name MWP (head of the Welsh parliament) sounded very similar to the word Muppet (puppet).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the way the letter u is pronounced in English in the Yorkshire accent.
The House Committee on Appointments, which is currently reviewing the name change legislation, said: "The final decision on any words describing the names of the members of the House of Representatives is, of course, the decision of the members of the House themselves".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh House of Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, in which broad support was given to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of Members of Parliament (AMs), the committee recommended Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the majority of support in consultation with the public.
Members of parliament are offering alternatives, but the struggle to get a consensus could cause a lot of pain to the chairwoman of the committee, Elaine Jones, who is due to file a bill on the changes in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the legislature works, including rules to distance members of parliament and structure of the committee system.
The vote of the members of parliament is that it will ultimately determine their title of office during the legislative debate.
Macedonian citizens are going to vote with the vote on changing the name of the country
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that its conquest of the North is in the form of a claim to Greek territory and a return and opposition to Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Georgy Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood.
According to Mr. Adams, the old neighbors say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner.
"Today there are no bars and no churches".
He says it's understandable that Bree's disappearance.
People's social lives today are different, you note.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis".
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders expect, and sooner or later they will find themselves back at the starting point".
He said the location of the churches would be captured by apartment buildings with shared homes that would house non-people who would help the neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people", he said, "and that would signal the closure of these churches, because most people who move into these buildings are unlikely to join these churches".
Both churches were built by women's faith communities, before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist belief community left in the 1930s.
A community believes a black woman who worked in the area became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community of believers under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a ban on merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the structure, but as part of the faithful's plans under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the construction of the Bell Crayon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and heir to his seat at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Crown the Poor Bells.
The expert who played the instrument in July called it another name: Cultural Treasure and Historical Instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell tower to be played by a black musician, Dionne A. Lind, who later played the largest bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marivoter said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's Church over the past few months was a complex story of architects and receptionists, some brought in by local church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The assembly - the governing body of a community of local believers - wrote a letter to the bishops in July expressing concerns that the bishops were trying to roll the costs of the assembly, although the assembly was not involved in the architectural and receptionist recruitment sent by the bishops.
Some of the faithful complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in a diving accident to catch lobsters
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as the boy went scuba diving to catch lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ancinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends since about an hour earlier Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then drove there with a group to help him get to the beach.
Hummel thought at first it was just a cry of enthusiasm about a lobster's capture, but then realized the boy was yelling "I'm bitten!"
I was bitten!
Hamel said that when he approached the boy he saw that his entire jawbone was torn.
"I shouted out to everyone: 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hamel.
The boy was rushed to Reddy Hospital in San Diego where his condition is classified as an ASD.
It's unknown which shark species attacked the boy.
Rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark was identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have blocked access to the beach between Pontoo Beach in Xpalade and Swami Beach in Assiniitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury's is planning to penetrate the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's starts out competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and develops a dog-shop-style crossing with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant effort to penetrate the UK beauty market, which is rolling in at Â£2.8 billion a year, and which continues to grow as sales in fashion and home goods are falling, the expanded beauty transfers will be tested at 11 stores across the country and if successful, will be added to additional stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes as retailers are looking for ways to use shelf space previously captured by televisions, microgalls and home products.
Sainsbury's reported that the company is expected to double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain additional territory with targeted brand areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The chain is also re-launching its boutique line of makeup products so that most products are environmentally friendly, a trait that is increasingly sought after by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop chain will be checking for affiliations at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the second in Slea Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift from buying small amounts of food every day in local convenience stores to requiring retailers to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the branches would become more like dog stores as the chain of stores tries to fight off the cheap Aldi and Lidl chains with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has added Argos's retail stores to hundreds as well as several Habitat stores since it acquired the two networks two years ago, additions that she says have increased sales of grocery products and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive its beauty departments and pharmacies have failed.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the connection ended after a dispute over how to split the profits from the pharmacies within the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business in its 281 branches to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Network for 125 million pounds three years ago.
She said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Sainsbury's commercial manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We've done the opposite in the look and feel of our beauty product vendors, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we've invested in highly trained staff who will be accessible to provide advice on the ground.
Our brand offerings are tailored to suit every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly and Willow cancelled a deal worth 11 million pounds.
TV show Dragons Den star Peter Jones has expressed anger after TV presenter Holly Willow cancelled a Â£11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marcus and Spencer and with ITV.
Actually, Willabie doesn't have time for a brand of home-made clothes and accessories.
The two's joint venture is thought to be similar to Goop's Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced her departure in an Instagram post.
Holly Willow left the show's Dragons Den star Peter Jones furiously boiling by cancelling her last-minute participation in the duo's luxury lifestyle brand - to focus on her oily contracts with Marcus and Spencer and with ITV.
Sources said Jones responded furiously when the TV star announced during a stormy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that following her new deal - worth up to Â£1.5m - she did not have enough time to devote to the brand's homewear and accessories Truly.
The pair's joint venture is thought to be similar to Goop's Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willamy's fee, which was estimated at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willow posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his resorts.
According to one source: "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income for decades to come.
The decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to drinking.
The company's warehouses in Marlowe are full of products for sale".
Experts believe that leaving This Morning, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to massive investments in a range of products, from towels and candles to homewear, and the potential for further delay in launch.
And that could lead to the end of a long friendship.
Willow, who is a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for 10 years.
Willabie founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The couple spent their holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willow will become the ambassador for M&S and replace Ann McCartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not responding to his business matters".
âª We had a hard conversation âª âª And then we fell in love âª
He joked about the criticism he gets from the news media about statements that some define as "un-presidential" and that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a newscaster's voice.
"I have made no concessions".
He noted Kim's interest in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step toward North Korea's dismantling of nuclear weapons.
But the negotiations on dismantling frozen nuclear weapons.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea saw no consistent response from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the summit.
"We're on a good run with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results -- halting missile tests, helping to free prisoners and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy being president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded stadium, we had about 200 people standing there", Trump said, voting straight in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have devastated an island and killed hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombo, for example, we told foreign NGOs that we didn't need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lumbok lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, a condition for international aid to be dispatched.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it's a bit of a challenge", Ms. Sombong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to fly to the Palau, it's still unclear if foreign envoys will be able to cross the field.
Mr. Sotofo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palo to see if more international services contribute to the relief effort.
In the face of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately not prepared enough for natural disasters.
While tsunami shells were built in Oche County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of warning signs probably warned of a tsunami in Palo Alto, although there was a warning, contributed to loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was built in Colombia to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
Indonesia's poor infrastructure improvement was at the center of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he invested a lot of money in roads and railroads.
But Mr. Goku is facing funding shortfalls to run for re-election next year.
Mr. Goku also faced the pressure of ongoing class tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious fragmentation of the country's Muslim majority.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs - using knives, bow and arrow and other household weapons.
Video: Daniel Stridge of Liverpool compares at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a call from McAnally Shakir about 30 yards from Chelsea's gate and his team in a 1-0 draw.
He jumped the ball to his left and then he turned it into the remote reef.
The ball is flying high above the width and landing towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball landed over the Cape of Good Hope gate that leaped towards it, and fell into the net.
I was just trying to get to that position, get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to make myself as much time as possible, Suredge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanta and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I just kicked".
Chelsea led 0-1 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Zar took the lead in the 25th minute.
The blue forward transferred a boat back to Matthew Koubachich that game, before turning near the middle of the field and running fast into half Liverpool's field.
Kubachitsch performed a fast-paced swing in the middle of the field.
Then he kicked a beautiful crossbow, leading the alien into the expanse.
The forward striker ran the defense and finished with the ball inside the top right corner of the gate, with a left kick passed Liverpool player Allison Coker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League home stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Vidatown in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the building collapses that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sotoufo Forou Naroho told a news conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was engulfed in the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police have opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Becknham, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. on Gwon Street as a mass grave, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on people in the area who've seen or heard something to contact her.
Search engine inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is underway, but I would like to call on anyone who was near Gwon Street in Birkhand and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a camera shot, to contact us -- because the footage may also contain information essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police announce they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Meuse recently tried to enter his apartment, but was told that the police forbade anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked to find out what happened.
The residents are now told to wait for hours until they have time to return to their apartments.
A police officer is being heard telling one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene when she died.
She comes back and cries. It's terrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were spotted inside the arena and another one outside.
A number of officers were standing inside the scene as they targeted people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and indicate the diary number 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell became the next target of attacks on memory situations in the struggle around the writing of history.
Removal of the statue would be poetic justice in light of the puritan supporters' purges of so many cultural and religious artistic objects in England.
But the Cromwell Foundation claims Mr. Creek's proposal is stupid and attempts to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current dispute over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell standing outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The excavation of the Civil War statues in England was not done on Cromwell's orders nor was it done by his own hand.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was a victim of the actions of one of his predecessors in the lineage, Thomas Cromwell, a century ago.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the pottery statue William Hammock Thornycroft is a testimony to 19th-century reflection and part of the historiography of a figure many believe still deserves to be honoured.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than he is today, as defending Parliament from external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is a completely accurate assessment is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
The fact that it's not surprising is that the struggle in the mid-17th century shaped our nation's subsequent development, and Cromwell is one of the most recognizable figures representing one side of the equation at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and victory".
A deadly pig that drove a Chinese farmer to his death
Local media sources report a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, whose family name is Xiuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery covered in blood near a pig's cottage in the Lufnshui Market in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject vaccines into a pig at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Chining, Qinghai Province, China.
Reports say he traveled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan County to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, a cousin found him dead, and found a door to a pigsty nearby open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were covered in blood and dirt", said my cousin whose family name is Wue, as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars and ran away to prevent him from attacking other people, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
It's reported that Yuan's family is negotiating with the market authorities for compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of human beings being attacked by pigs.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing human injuries to the owner.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig strapped a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife ran away from the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Goodwill told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood may be triggered.
They're just playing.
They're like spoiled, very curious kids... They don't mean to hurt you.
We just have to give them the proper respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains across a wide area of the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it moves over cooler waters off the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Tropical Storm Rosa will bring heavy rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The winds in the storm rose to 135 km/h, which is a Category 1 hurricane, and due Sunday at 5 a.m. eastern time, the center of the storm is located 620 km southeast of Punta Yugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tropical storm is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the east coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the peninsula in the Gulf of California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that combines with the approaching humidity will produce heavy rainfall over large areas of the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 meters of rain will cause flash floods and a risk of soil pollutants in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall to reach 50 to 75 millimeters per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the distribution nature of the tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could turn shopping malls into cloudy rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching producer will bring local rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
There may be total rainfall of over 13 mm, which could cause debris to drag and road parts.
It'll be the first rain in the area this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain meters will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and rain will intensify and expand over the next Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes across the United States, with the Arctic cooling but the tropics remaining fairly warm.
This condition sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there's a perfect example of extreme temperature changes across the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis to Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, prolonged Cayce fever will try to develop and spread again.
In early October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern U.S., ranging from 27 to 31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows a higher-than-average chance of temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Bert Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people on six television networks on Thursday watched the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blazey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued, with news anchors in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprise development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Geoff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Quano was smoking his body while drunk and tried to strip her during a high school reunion.
Kavanaugh, in confession, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
The number of viewers was probably even higher than the report of 20.4 million viewers on the Nielsen scoreboard.
Nielsen rated average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring people watching in offices.
By comparison, it's a crowd watching on a scale similar to a football playoff game or an Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose interpreters are enthusiastic supporters of Kavanaugh's nomination, led the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest levels remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the central character in a drama that premiered on Friday.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, he was photographed by CNN and CBS cameras as a group of protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to reach a hearing at the Judiciary Committee.
He stood in humiliated gaze for a few minutes as the demonstrations grabbed him, all of which was recorded live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power when so many women are helpless".
Flake said his office made a statement saying that before the elevator door was closed, he would say more at the committee hearing.
All the networks and cable broadcast live hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was about to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate.
But Flake said he would vote in favor of the nomination only on condition that it was understood that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority demanded.
Flake was partially convinced after conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Connors.
After talking to Constable and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was powerful, because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused her critics of playing politics on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused her visitors of leaving the EU as "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national Internet, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her that appeared alongside the idea on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson continued to attack her plan to "play the game" with Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU would counter this one's tariffs is "completely outrageous".
Police arrested Dayton Simpson as a suspect in the murder of an LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for LSU.
A 20-year-old man named Ditton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, police said in a statement.
Officials posted a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a report from WAFB, which is part of CBS.
After Simpson was investigated, police said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The bail was set at $350,000, as reported by the Advocate.
The Eastern Division of the Atonement Rose Pathology Institute released an initial report Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
Police have given credit to the task force to catch fugitive criminals in the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens who helped investigate the suspect.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alva has acknowledged to law enforcement in the area the "destruction and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
The forward, who rose to over two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, his average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was shocked and appalled by Wade's death.
"It's the thing you're afraid of all the time", Wade said.
The volcano is shedding ash on Mexico City.
Ash that escaped from the Popocatectal volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the volcano increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
There's a lot of noise and vibration in the center of the neutron.
Social media images showed minute layers of ash cover on the muscles of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as SochiMillo.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity on the volcano, located 72 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Guo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists approaching the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to disperse the protests, and thousands more joined the demonstrations against the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked thugs who were blown away by police to disperse the demonstrations threw eggs at the police and sprayed paint dust, creating black dust clouds on the streets that usually crowds tourists.
Clashes broke out later that day when police were forced to use their weapons to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups stood up and chanted, "We shall not forget, we shall not forgive" against the pro-unity group called the Spanish People.
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in pro-independence areas a year after the October 1 referendum was declared a legal prison by the Spanish government, but was celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become an independent state, although the turnout was low when those who opposed secession overwhelmingly outlawed the vote.
Catalan government officials reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the ballot from being cast in a violent clashes across the region.
Independence groups set up camping for a night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The protest took place but had to be conducted in a different direction.
Narcisse ThÃ©rmes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the dispute with his wife, said he lost hope about Catalonia's chance of gaining independence.
Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying joyfully that they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties won a significant victory, although a push, in the last December elections, they struggled to maintain the momentum of the year as many of their best-known leaders are in voluntary exile or prison awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and the ensuing declaration of independence.
Juan Foyge, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, said the riots were being waged by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
It's going to go away, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since her trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reaffirm the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government, he said.
Several men were arrested after a car crashed into the house.
Three men - aged 33-34 and 39 - were arrested after a car crashed several times at a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred in Blenagurg Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm CET.
Detective Bob Flemings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point an arrow was fired at the car.
A bang by Manga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mangan's first gate to Livingston promised victory.
Livingston, who had just been promoted, impressed Rangers and his friend Stephen Gerard with this being only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibercus.
Dolly Manga's beating was significant because Gary Holt's band moved up a level with the Hibernates in second place.
Gerrard's team is undefeated out of the postseason, and they're facing the eight-point lead Hart's team next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Wayne in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is extending the home-loss streak to six games, and head coach Holt hasn't had a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against a weak host team.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they captured the gate, when their stealth caused the Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson jumped forward but pulled his experiments before the gate, and then Alan Lithgow could only focus his efforts on the outside after slipping in to meet Craig Helget's swing in front of the gate.
The hosts were willing to let Ranger play in front of them, knowing they could make the host team harder with free kicks.
And that's how the decisive gate was built.
The Rangers were beaten free and Livingston created an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining to block Manga, who made a touchdown and took a gate from the center of the field.
At this point, the Rangers controlled the ball tightly but discovered the home defense was impenetrable, leaving the squad of Liam Kelly almost unthreatened.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnam was beaten by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow touched a wide kick from another free kick from Livingston.
Cross bullets continued to enter Livingston's grounds and beaten, while two penalty balls - after the Helicet's breach of the replacement Glenn Middleton, and one on the reaching arm - were removed.
Amazing from Livingston - Surgery
Alstyer LeMont, BBC Scotland at the Tony MacCrunney Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were great, and they kept raising expectations in this upward movement.
Their playing style and player structure have barely changed since their return to the lead position, but much credit must be given to the highlight of the way he has shaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holcott was formidable, leading a remarkably organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on high alert all the way.
But the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were quite good at it sometimes under the Gerrard, they didn't live up to those standards.
They missed the final ball - they only opened the home team's defense once - and that's a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Welcome to the Arduino in the Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - his goal was to repair relations between the two NATO members.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
From there, ErdoÄan continued to Kalan to attend the opening of a new massive mosque.
Klen is the largest city with the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police announced security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters flocked nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also voiced their voices, protesting both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him into the country.
The anti-demonstrations mirror the controversy surrounding the guest that some Turks in Germany hail as a hero and others defend as a fan.
Motorcycle rider killed in car crash in Dartford
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Streets at Stood and Evelyn, a busy road in the city of Dartford, south-east of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and the officers treated the wounded, but the man died on the spot.
The collision comes after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childer Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
City police said police are trying to identify the murder and notify his family.
Instead of buses and buses turning to alternate routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Ratin Prison: Six inmates were wounded in the riot
Six inmates were injured in the riot at a men's prison, the prison office reported.
The riot broke out at Long Rettin Prison in West Yorkshire on Sunday at around 09:30 CET, and it's still ongoing.
Special agents from the Tornado Unit were brought in to quell the riot, which included eight prisoners and a single gang.
Prisoners were treated at the scene for minor injuries inside.
A prison service spokesman said, "Specially trained inmates have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Larin Prison.
Six inmates were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that the criminals will be turned over to the police and their prison terms may be extended.
Long Ratin Prison houses 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police disruptors were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot where prisoners were attacked with sneakers.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It's rare for tropical rain to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the desert southeast and bring with it the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already declared a threat of flash flooding on Monday and Wednesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to make a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach the end of Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or tropical depression status within a 322-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
Recent models from the Arizona Hurricane Center observe 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm along the edge of the Arizona Mogul.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 m, with the possibility of isolated locations reaching at least 50 m.
For those outside the flash flood-prone area, the rain of a Rose storm may be a blessing because the area has suffered from rainfall.
Although flooding is a serious danger, some of this rainfall will be helpful because the southwest region is currently suffering from shape-shifting conditions.
According to the U.S. Flood Watch, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in severe flooding, the second-worst category, according to weather.com.
First, a path of the storm rose will land across the peninsula in the Gulf of California in Mexico.
The storm, which is still a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 137 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Yugena, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of about 20 km/h.
The storm encountered cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it weakened.
It is therefore expected to reach the mainland of Mexico in the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Rains across parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a risk of heavy flooding.
Rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected from the coast of California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm, reports weather.com.
Then, the storm Rosa will continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat from the storm, or its remnants, is heavy rainfall in the Gulf of California, southwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and streams of life-threatening waste in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Trace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday around 04:00 CST.
He was taken to the hospital where he was left in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset area, the mob said.
The police are asking anyone who may have a cell phone record of what happened to contact the police.
Trump said Quano suffered the convictions and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and shocking tactics", Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Quano has endured the convictions, the anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying the accusation of Christine Blazey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her indictment.
The president said on Saturday that the people of the United States saw the brilliance and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to approve the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to approve the appointment of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record of public service", he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president addressed Kavanaugh's nomination indirectly when he spoke about the importance of Republicans getting to vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks until one of the most important votes of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am, actually, a candidate, he said.
So I run everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed the Democrats were on a mission to resist and disrupt.
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by huge waves that hit the shores, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources reported on Saturday.
A crowd gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, when waves carrying up to 18 feet (6 meters) hit the beach at sunset, dragging many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were still doing their business on the coast and did not immediately escape, and they fell victim", said Sotofo Furu Noruho, spokesman for the BNPB Disaster Management Agency, at a lecture in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground, Noroho said, adding that the tsunami advanced over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people turned to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial footage released by the Disaster Agency showed the destruction of a large number of homes and shops, bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
Minor earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have devastated an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful quake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said the geography of the city, which sits on the edge of a long, rough bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as sudden and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Noroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along northern Palo with a 300 km (190 mi) long coastline, an area called Dongla, and closer to the epicentre.
The media is completely crushed and there is no information from the Dongola, Noroho said.
The Red Cross said in a statement that the area is home to more than 300,000 people, adding that its people and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy now, but it could get a lot worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting tsunami damage to the palace, although officials said the waves came as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, you can see a man on a high-rise building shouting hysterical tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water collapses on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the photo was authentic.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that shut down the media around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending convoys with assistance from Jakarta and other caves, authorities say, but survivors are still desperate for food and other essential necessities.
The city's airport will be open for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Jokowi and his team are scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo Alto on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's very difficult.
When the people of World Vision from Dongla arrived safely in the city of Palo, where workers were trapped in shelters made of brass set up in their courtyards, they passed through mirrors of destruction on their way, Mr. Dusseba said.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed, he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the sad efforts of disaster relief movements, there were complaints that you were prevented from reaching the pallo by highly experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesian regulations, it is only possible to start inflows of funds, supplies and people from other countries if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a provincial disaster", said Ulia Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster, we can open the door to international aid, but that status has not been declared".
With the second night's rainfall on Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family members of the missing clinged to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman buried under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body by her side.
Gannon Subundo, coach of the Indonesian relay team, coach of two relay teams missing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the hotel saw saw, including Mr. Mandzukie, were his students.
An old man in the field of stretch marks, I carry my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after the news of the hotel collapse saw a boom among the climbing slums, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors at the Palu Beach Festival.
But his messages showed only one gray criticism mark, instead of a pair of blue ones.
I think the implication is that the messages were not delivered, he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling a cash machine at Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Bronx employee who filled a cash machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, investigative reporter Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind a Bronx employee and stole a purse with money to fill in the ATM.
Until he saw a number of suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Any person with any information about their identity is requested to contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that was known as Kenya West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed "Love Ye" for some time and has used the nickname as his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on the Saturday Night Live television show, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who canceled her participation for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
Besides being the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the meaning of the word is 'you', and Seth said earlier this year, when he was talking about the name of his album with Big Boy Radio.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It's gone from Kanye, which means the one and only, to just Ye-- just a reflection of the good that we've done, the bad that we've done, or the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of the few famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs was known by the alternative names Pop Daddy, Pi Daddy or Diddy, but this year announced he preferred the names "Love" and "Brotherly Love".
West's former partner, Jay Zee, also switched between versions of his name with and without a pen and letters.
The Mexican president pledged not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, pledged never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Military forces fired on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the funding of AI.
With China's growing AI activity, the U.S. needs to double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His remarks come after various parts of the US government have issued statements about AI, even when the US government has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: It aims to be No. 1 in AI by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next AI breakthrough", he told me.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be achieved in the United States, I was told by CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in China's most prominent AI company, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the first graduate Rversa player in the United States, and later served as a senior manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
I was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the agency's robotics challenge to advanced research projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
It's not China that takes our top researchers from the academy, it's the business companies that do it, he told me.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years recruited university stars to work in AI.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the United States step up its AI efforts.
"I think we should automatically offer a green card to PhDs in AI", he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council published its next-generation AI development plan.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that provide research grants in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, I say.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, designed to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI initiative called AI Next.
And as for NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. law initiative to create an AI National Security Committee has been dormant for months.
The people of Macedonia are voting in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians vote on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented its joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its name of the northern province is in the form of a claim to Greek territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue the change will hurt the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a campaign of banning questioned whether the number of voters would stand at the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to pay so that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to signal the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us", said the 79-year-old Olga Georgizbekka in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will vote on the results to make it binding.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities at 1:00.
However, the percentage of voters was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of eligible voters got to vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Josha Tanbsky, 62, voting in the capital city of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zurica and son Dushko are casting their ballot in Stromitsa, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, in the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name, which will open the door to its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament House in Scopea, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavordekov prepared a small platform and chairs in front of tents that were set up by those who were obstructing the people's will.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a standing head, not through the entry of servants", said Coward Cove.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said companies in NATO would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is above 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will support that more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO", Zaib said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be to secure our future.
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the leading television network Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be at least 50 percent and one more.
The election's failure would be the first significant loss of pro-Western government policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player, Sergio Aguero, navigates through all of Brighton's defenses to crack a gate
The Aguro and Sterling brothers broke Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Ehtad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero had easily conquered the gate.
Argentine pilot got a ship in the middle of the field at the start of the line.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players before breaking into the open field.
At this point Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he could get a few more shields running over Brighton's broad border.
Then he kicked a boat to the left, and found Sterling.
The Englishman used his first touch on the street to deliver the ball back to Aguero, who hit Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a ball on the right side of the net.
Jaguar has foot problems, Manchester City's manager told reporters.
We agreed he'd play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he got a gate at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky contents their starting lead in the Super League.
This gate came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the bullet deep in Brighton's territory during this.
He sent a great cross-ball along the right flank to LeRoy Saana.
Sana hit the ball before leading Sterling into the far reaches.
The blue-sky player pushed the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
Manchester City will face the Champions League home crowd at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Nkarn Stadium in Zensheim, Germany.
Razor wants to play Spoiler vs. the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a very competitive roster hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it still has a playoff effect for the Rockies, who lead one game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least a spot on the opening card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they haven't promised themselves first place at home yet.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is with the spectators and the second team will play at the highest level probably at any point you're up against this year.
Why wouldn't I want to deal with it?"
The Nationals have not announced a Sunday starter yet, but they are reportedly tending to let the Foreign Minister serve in that situation.
Shrews, which will be his 34th start, trained on the stage on Thursday and served his day off on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander has an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump has a stop in West Virginia.
The president indirectly hinted at the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Bert Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we did was on the line in November.
Five weeks to the most important decisions of our lives.
It's one of the most, most -- I'm not running, but I actually am, so I run everywhere and fight for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible and horrible group of extremist Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you are determined to take back the power by any means necessary, you see the convictions, the contempt.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to resist and disrupt.
And you've seen it over the last four days, he said, and he's been calling the Democrats angry and evil and disingenuous and dishonest.
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee minority leader, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, in her name, which drew outrage from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you dump the document?
Oh, what.
No, uh, no, I waited until -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a Floralist place.
She's not tolerant of people expressing their opinions.
When momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in line of Labour MPs who were told they weren't wanted - and only because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Juan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was aggressively anti-Semitic.
In my case, the decision to censor me was made by me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe - ironically, for most of Europe, these are similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with with previous party leaders on.
The committee on the East Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday said that we wanted the meeting to be smooth and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the general committee meetings on Friday nights were just like that.
Fortunately, today, it's not the culmination of many of the meetings and the promise of a politer, gentler politics that's long forgotten, if ever started.
It's increasingly apparent that the Labour Party is intolerant of different views, and every opinion is judged on its acceptance of the leadership of the party.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who I once thought shared a similar political outlook began to expect him to make a profit and to take positions that I would never have agreed to otherwise - whether it was about national security or a single European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's a huge amount of abusive software on social media right now with calls for rejection, criticism of the Centre's politics and calls for me not to be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments that are meant for me tend to be political.
I am struck by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a wave of racial abuse every day but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become a common concern.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we're already in the same pluralistic place, and with every no-confidence decision or change in election rules, the party gets more complicated.
Over the last two years, many people have advised me to shut up, not be so loud, and then I'll be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, shocked by the failure of the Thatcher government that almost broke up my public school classroom, I've been looking for ways to fight for better social services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government official.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way confuse my political positions and issues of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who voted for the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country crawls toward a Brexit that will hurt our families, our businesses and our public service, I don't understand the urge to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the only message I have, in fact, is not to the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my elected public, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of rejection threats or political expediency will deter me from operating in a way that I believe serves the best interests of all of you.

Air 38-17 from Melrose: Unbeatable Air to the top
The last two strikes have slightly offended the final score, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the fun and wonderful game of the Scottish Super League today.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the tenth.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as taking a lot more risks, playing for the home team, and coach Peter Moretzky had every reason to be happy.
We've stood the test in our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose Group said, "Layer deserves all the credit, they took risks better than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, which was scored by Fraser Climue, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes released by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Bagot caught Terry not scoring.
Climone lifted Ayr's lead by one stroke, before halfway through, he won, then Mayor Trey Solo to make 17-5 at Ayr halfway through.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Patrick Angerson's Troy, who was hit by a goat, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Roderick Knut, who was taken from there at Elonca, and from the game resumption, Ayr widened the gap through the Stafford McDowell's tray, which was overrun by climate.
Air Force Captain Blair McPherson then took a yellow card, and again Malrose took advantage of the other person with Bruce Colvin's unhomered Troy, at the end of a succession of tremendous pressures.
But the home team recovered, and when Strawne Hutchinson got a yellow card for a no-ball climb attack, off the bench, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's forward line.
Climate the tide, as he did again almost from the return to the game, after Kyle Roy Ace kicked a box of David Armstrong and sent out the tight end Gregor Henry to the sixth try of the home team.
Still Game star looks set for a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kearnen seems poised to move into the restaurant business after it turns out he's been named manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Garvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and also stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Humphrey.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the show's final season, and it looks like Kearnan is planning life after Curling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source suggested Kearnan was looking for ways to get into the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
Bolivia without a way out of the sea hopes the court will pave the way for her to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are visiting the Navy Headquarters wrapped in a few ships in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a flag of sea blue.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to sue him back".
Across Bolivia, where there is no sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive - as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may have been in Xi'an for decades, as Bolivia awaits an October 1 decision by the International Court of Justice after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and it certainly expects a positive attitude to it, said Roberto Cazadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will protest the International Court of Justice's decision over large-scale disputes across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that after decades of disrupted talks, Chile commit to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic native president, O'Morals - who is facing a controversial re-election bid next year - is expected to make a big decision on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But commentators believe there's little chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if it does, it won't change much.
The United Nations Court of Human Rights in The Hague has no authority to grant Chile territory, and states that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling came just six weeks after the hearing of the agreed arguments suggests that the case was not complicated, but that it was Faz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's claims, it may even have been weakened by the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current government in Bolivia", Zarata said.
Morales' warlike rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile, she said.
Someday Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez VelÃ¡zquez, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's ruling was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of dispute for the benefit of both sides, he said.
Calladiella also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the issue of water as a political platform.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"A break is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Young, said that his country would never dismantle its nuclear weapon first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri delivered a speech on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United Nations to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of reopening diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that came to a halt more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Lee said it was a dream come true to think that continued U.S. sanctions and resistance to declare an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel down.
The United States is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea taking significant steps to disarm nuclear weapons first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
However, there is widespread doubt that North Korea is serious about abandoning its nuclear arsenal, where it likely sees the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new trend in giant hats that have been on its way to luxury stores everywhere.
We've got a solution for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get complete sun protection.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a line of huge, crazy headgear to their SS19 collection at a fashion show that set the stage for Paris Fashion Week.
Apparently, impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their outstanding creations to the fashion show circuit.
The highlight of Valentino was an over-the-top, yellow hat with wide edges that were feathered and covered the models' heads.
Other small-sized accessories included a peanut butter, a magic hat, and even pineapples - but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of weird masks - tested for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks included sewn lips and more blood for the hannibal than for the hotter.
One piece looked like a diving mask, including a snorkel and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream cup.
And for those who want to keep up with a trendy, dimensional statement, their time has come.
Fashion commentators watch the giant hills make their way to luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after the Bombah, a half-metre-wide, edged strap hat that looks over everyone's head, from Mariana to Emily Rtaikowski.
The label of the callet behind the highly impractical hat that flooded social media spawned another big creation on the track - a sea-gown bag almost the size of a model in a sea-gown that carried it.
The burnt-colored reliever bag, with white leather and white-colored grooves, was the highlight of Gucelin-la-RiviÃ¨re's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and big seaweed to hit luxury stores next summer - because the design made a huge impression and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which is reinforced by individual and group success in sport, the arts, music and other community-building fields.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for careers of their choice and place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, we're finding that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a sought-after field of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes into their head".
When you talk to a person in his language, it goes into his heart".
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the latest tests this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the list with the highest success rates in independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages got a high A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, the language field as a subject of choice is considered at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Council found that among the reasons employers cited for filling vacancies, 17 percent were linked to a lack of language skills.
Thus, as language skills grow, they become essential to prepare students for future careers.
Given the increasing demand for languages for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically establishes a person's advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to enable conversation, and French was the only language where the two-digit number of speakers was 15 percent.
That's why it's important to invest in teaching languages to children today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will focus on languages that are considered the most important for Britain in the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child's field of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a team of teachers who specialize in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, in the foreseeable future.
There's no denying that today, in a global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future of our country, so that fact needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, we must see in modern languages the international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish children.
It's a watch order.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Barron is scheduled to make his debut against the Maddie Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who were waiting to see Baron James play for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But we haven't decided how many minutes he'll play.
It'll be more than one and less than 48, according to the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Trump's arrest time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opened the door in the wake of tonight's election shutdown in Wheeling, Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump stops this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote approves his nomination to the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's stop in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's detention in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. eastern coast time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online on YouTube.
Trump will likely refer to the hearings that took place this week about Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh, which became tense around allegations of sexual misconduct and the subsequent postponement of the vote in the Senate during the week the FBI is investigating the allegations.
But the primary purpose of this stopgap is to help Republicans facing challenging elections in November get some momentum.
President Trump's campaign office said the goal of these five stops next week is to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible as the election season enters", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters who asked to remain anonymous.
The evening's rally, scheduled to take place at Wassbanko Stadium in Wheeling, could bring backers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage from the Pittsburgh media to assess West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican senator candidate Patrick Morrissey, who's a poll-defeated man.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come in to try to improve his polling status", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows willingness to fight to keep hope for their only games on Sunday
After three years of one-on-one play, the quarterfinals on Sunday afternoon might be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum-driven killer is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think we're gonna find the momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so you can see a little momentum in that", said Governor Spitzer at the end of the day.
Europe ahead of course, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as Spitzer says, feel they have a little bit of spirit in their boots, and they have a lot to encourage, and not the last one in the form of Spitzer and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one of them is down three points out of four.
Spitzer was a lethal slow-to-green and he's a leader by personal example.
The shouts of joy grew as his round continued, as he sank Pat Critic to win the all-square four game and Thomas fell two after two.
His fate that resulted in a 15on game win won a similar scream, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
"You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game", Spitzer said.
That's all any of these players have left to do.
18 rows to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Thomas and Spitzer over the past two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unrivalled lead story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird, but charming pair are four out of four and they all win.
"Mollywood were the only pair not to shoot the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and then nine on Friday morning.
That round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, underpins the fact that they are the winners on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player from Fleetwood or Moulinary to sign a potential European victory with the sun setting on Le Golf National.
It's better both at the same time in different heights.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bob and Tasson and Webb Simpson ended up with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he cheated with Alex Norne.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine brought the Spaniards and Swedes down to a hole they never got near.
However, on Sunday there's no one to help you out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four balls and the quatrains because of the interactions between the twins, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is significantly ahead of the last day, but this fourth-place finish showed that the American team is full of a fighting spirit that some, especially within the United States, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is in a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the quarter-finals on Saturday 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired Tommy Plitwood and Voroncesco Molinari pair led the change with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Byrne's European side, trying to defend the trophy they lost to Hazellitin two years ago, took over the Americans who missed the quarterfinals this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The American players showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but failed to close the gap.
To keep the trophy, Jim Forrick's teammates need eight points from 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European tyrant to win four consecutive points, while he and Millinery, who earned the nickname Mollywood after an exceptional weekend, are only the second pair to win four of their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they went on in amazing harmony together to defeat the weakened Woods and American champion Bryson DeCambaugh with an even more impressive 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself over two games on Saturday, showed random bursts of excellence, but so far he's lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-ball games, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who fell asleep during the morning four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals to defeat 2 and 1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copke - ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went well for the European players in the warm weather and the gentle wind that blowed southwest to Paris.
The three-time outstanding winner, Jordan Spitzer and Justin Thomas, set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won by a hard-fought 2-1 victory over John Ram of Spain and Ian Fuller in the quarter-finals and later came back to defeat Fletcher and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the quarter-finals, after losing the first two rounds.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team come back from a negative four-point gap to the single game, although as cup holders, Forrick's men only need a lineup to keep the trophy.
However, after being second for two days, it seems that the attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister announced on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the UN's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken significant goodwill measures last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing not to develop any more nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any consistent response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defense and under such conditions we will never unilaterally disarm ourselves first from nuclear weapons.
While Sheri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about the United States' opposition to a "degraded" approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded while taking incremental steps, his statement seems important in that it has not pushed the brink of nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to act toward a nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula while Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
The Arab League insists on nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can make us hurt our knees is a dream in the asymmetry of people who are lying about us.
But the problem is that the harsh sanctions deepen our distrust".
Lee did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president stressed in his speech at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the other side of the nuclear disengagement issue was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disengagement of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate".
However, the tone of Lee's speech was dramatically different from last year's, so he told the UN General Assembly that a US missile strike on North Korea was inevitable after President Trump named Kim as a Rocket Man who is on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a set time frame for it, and he added that whether it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with determination and unceasing until a complete and final nuclear dismantling is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left A Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but hours later North Korea condemned him for placing gangster demands.
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States takes appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the coordinated measures he's interested in include security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore, as well as changes toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the expanding Mazo culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea what the basic principles of how to care for themselves are.
Charles Kessler, a sleep science professor at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he estimated to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, one girl looked at me and said, "Why are you telling me this just now, my senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains the principles of how good sleep habits help students achieve academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Breyer, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of the university's health services, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
One section shows a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sportswear and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants were told how persistent sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know it won't change the behavior of students overnight.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", Professor Chezler added.
He said a culture of pride about sleepless nights still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of sleep deprivation to increase.
Concern for adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be every student's secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep transfers the brain to a state of hunger, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Chazler design the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course lit his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course on campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all advanced degree students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisel advised students to consider the possibility of setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to bed, not just when it was time to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from flashing electronic displays and LEDs, which can violate the rhythm of the dance and thus cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Manha's goal is decisive for Gerard's players
The Rangers suffered another attack of defeat in the away game when Dolly Manga caused Steven Gerrard's rebellious players to be defeated 1-0 at Livingston.
The Aybrokes were hoping to achieve their first away win since the 1-4 victory on February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerard's second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving the club eight points behind the persistent Harts side in the top flight of the Scottish Super League.
Manga attacked seven minutes into the half and it didn't look like the Rangers were getting any better off.
While Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is drawing to third and right behind Hibernian in the gate clearance.
And maybe waiting for Rangers to double up after the Calum Spence network needed treatment for a head injury after the object was probably thrown off the deck.
Gerard made eight substitutions in the team that went through to the semi-finals in the separate Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, climbed with the same 11 Livingston players who scored a point from the Hartes last week, and he could be satisfied with how his players beat their opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost won in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Patman who knocked on Alan McGregor's door, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Keegan Goku found Captain Craig Ellett, but his shield Allen Thutmose could only kick out of the basket.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been suspended for violating his probation after a quarter-hour game when he and Steven Wills clashed, but Judge Stephen Thompson took advantage of the Colombian player's punishments.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal just twice in the first half but Ibercus goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily derailed the swing of the LeSana Colliballi and the weak batting of Obi-Aggari.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute was contrary to how the game was played, no one would deny they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Again the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' deep free throw.
Scott Artfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool temper in passing it to the Mango to a simple finish.
Gerard made an impact in the half when he replaced Colliby with Ryan Kent, and the switch had an almost immediate impact when the wing-winger hit a ball to Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the host team to play exactly the kind of game she liked, as Lithgow and the pack continued to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to prevent Jacobs' experiment before a reaction got around the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was later charged with another offense against Jacobs, but Thompson again ignored.
Widow: The inventor of the Mona Geiger
And now to stand from the Sunday Morning diary: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and on... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method that allows detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Mona Geiger.
The device has since become a scientific intermediary, but in 1950 it also became a pop culture intermediary with the film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were portrayed as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
ROGERS: This is the Geiger Monon, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones together, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on atoms in minerals".
Oh, my God, it's really explosive right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells and kill them.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, and changing the cells in the lab.
Then the cells can detect a protein that's common to many types of cancer and then they're passed back to the patient.
Experimental vaccination has shown promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman who was given a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, cervical cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab so they can detect a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Brzezinski, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 is a driver of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, bladder and colon, explained Professor Berzowski.
A similar approach of taking immunosomes from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells was successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kenya West broke into a Trump-supported programming address, as his head was wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It wasn't well received.
Kenya West was responded to by a humorous reading in his studio during a mixed performance on the Straday Night Live show, while praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called August Town, during which he wore the Make America Great hat, he broke a speech against the Democrats and renewed his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, 'How can you love Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd be leaving America a long time ago, he said.
The episode on SNL began with a syndicated adaptation starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Burt Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault brought by Christine Blazey Ford.
Although the demonstration speech was not broadcast on the show, the episode was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to roll on West in the commercial.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind bars.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat on your head".
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the dark place?" They said he was wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love".
His remarks received at least two scandalous reviews from the audience, and it seemed that the SNL staff members were embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the newspaper: "A deep silence has fallen throughout the studio".
West joined the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-husband, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West mumbled many when he performed the song I love it when he wears a bottle of Perrier.
West received a response from TPUSA conservative leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd".
But the presenting act of the Acttalia program, the Hunter Foundation, tweeted that West was just who he was and that was absolutely wonderful.
But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) that I thought was an effort and spread an ideology that was damaging to my community.
He's free.
And we too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now a entity formerly known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Daddy, also known as Poppy Daddy, Poppy and P. Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, was called Snoop Lion, and of course the famous musician Prince changed his name to Sergeant and later to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder following a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Belshemwar.
The suspect is due in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the Game of Thrones, Keith Harington, attacks the poisonous masculinity of the
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as Snow White in the Middle East fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the heroic Matsuo, saying that such roles on screen often conveyed to young children the message that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisonous masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admits he is very upset about handling this issue.
Personally, I'm feeling very upset right now - where did we go wrong about masculinity?
What do we teach men when they're growing up, from the perspective of the problem we're witnessing now?
Keith thinks television may be partly responsible for the rise of poisonous masculinity, because of the very masculine characters it portrays.
He continued: "What comes from within and what we learn from outside?
What can we learn from television and the street that makes young children feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because there's no doubt something went wrong for young men.
In an interview he admitted that he would not participate in any sequel series or derivative series of the Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, saying he was done with battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepherd's play The Real West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so that's how the show gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on, he said.
Rose played Yegrit, the favourite of Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the courtyard of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are suffering from the disease, official health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV this way has dropped to almost zero, according to official Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Yet, in a year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose by 100,000.
HIV transmission from sexual intercourse is a hot issue in the Chinese community.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the state, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of insufficient use of these protective measures in intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and defended the dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the Senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Senator estimates that claims are being made by far-right websites and visitors.
"Lies, lies and other lies are detestable", Waters said in a Twitter ad.
According to reports, the information released included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday, and published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the hearing before the Senate Committee on Sexual Misconduct charges against Supreme Court Justice nominee, Bert Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the ads was linked to Waters' office and published the information about a member of Waters' team, according to the Hill report.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and utterly false", Waters added.
My co-worker -- whose identity and personal information were exposed and whose safety was compromised by these false accusations and errors -- was not responsible for any way of leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and utterly false".
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
"This is an angry denial", wrote Fleischer.
That indicates she doesn't have the mood Congressmen need.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't react with anger.
He can't respond with a harassment.
He must not question the accuser's motives.
He should be calm and his own".
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' response to a Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by a visitor who seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Novaro, a Republican candidate who is trying to beat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Great if that's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office has reached out to the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these false claims.
We're making sure that the perpetrators are discovered, and they stand trial for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my crew members.
Reviews for the film Johnny English 3.0 - A Spoiled Spoof starring Rowan Atkinson
It's now common to look for implications about Brexit in every new film from a British perspective, and it does seem to fit this revival of the action-comedy parody of Johnny English - which started somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will an ironic self-strike on how worthless we are become our country's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the full-blown English gentleman with his eyes wide and his rubber face had another chance to mess things up - and his name symbolizes more than anything that this is a broad comedy for non-English speaking audiences.
He's of course the stupid English agent, who despite his strange glittering face looks a little like a clown, a little bit of a master of the man who contributes a lonely note to the pleasures of the fire chariots in the opening text of the 2012 London Olympics.
It's also based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson portrayed in the forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, leaving chaos behind him.
There's a nice minute or two in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I loved the part where a young Englishman approaches a helicopter in medieval armor, and his pushy father rings for a moment on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his physical comic abilities, but humor feels rather weak and oddly unnecessary, especially since the serious genre of spy films like 007 and Impossible Missions themselves now include a comic component.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and because Johnny English's crazy, failed adventures are less brilliant and focused than Atkinson's silent film style jokes about Mr. Bean.
The plot of the film begins when great danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker broke into the top-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the chagrin of the chief agent - a small role unfortunately for Kevin Aldon.
This is the final challenge for a proud and warlike prime minister who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fill the role of Theresa May, but she has little to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy is exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that says a respectable, self-proclaimed English gentleman, now employed as a school principal at a prestigious institution, but giving informal lessons on how to be a secret spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a rock-school espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for emergency mentorship and reunited with his former assistant to Suffering Mod Boop, who is again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Boff is now a married man to a submarine commander, in the role of a boring class queen on whom Vico Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So in the time and in the rubin of Her Majesty's Secret Service, a terrible complication returns to action, when a beautiful Pam-Fatal is cast as the beautiful Opel who is played by Olga Corilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling for the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems - the evil Jason Volta at the age of Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey which is more of a two-man parlour: in the guise of waiters, they set fire to a quaint French restaurant; they create an endless amusing experience as they run off on the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English sets off a complete anarchy in his attempt to use the virtual reality of the house to learn to recognize the inner structure of Volta's home.
No doubt all efforts are being made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the likes and dislikes, it has a feel of children's television.
It's a pretty medium level.
And like the other British horror films, I couldn't help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan that the British will work four days a week - but get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company executives to pass on the savings from the AI revolution to employees in the form of additional rest days.
I mean, the workers have three days' weekends, and they're still getting the same salary.
Sources said the idea was in line with the company's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in the workers' favor.
The Congress of Trade Unions supports a shift to a four-day work week as a way for workers to enjoy the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the Party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party policy and the party does not consider it".
Labour's candidate for Treasury Secretary, John McDonnell, used the party convention last week to articulate his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to recruit the power of impartial executives and price-payers in service companies.
The Treasury Secretary candidate's plans also suggest that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make cuts based on disclosure of improper conduct.
He also approved plans to add employees to the boards of directors of companies and to create a joint stock company to transfer 10 percent of private sector companies' capital to employees, which would add up to a two-year dividend of up to Â£500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, told the TV show 60 minutes if the FBI investigation into Quano changes their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the investigation could convince which of the Republicans to withdraw his support.
With the idea being broadcast on Sunday's 60-minute program, writer Scott Fley asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to the South Carolina Party than his colleague.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kawano.
I called him after it happened, the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, and single-minded".
But it seems Graham's vote is stuck in the rock.
I've already decided on Bert Kavanaugh and there's going to be a need for a bombshell charge, he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Burt has vehemently denied this, Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
No one she mentioned could confirm it.
The case is 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change".
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
Saturday New York extended the Citizens of the World Festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars to appear and no less impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The World Citizens Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring tens of thousands of people to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mandes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), on the concert island to complete a series of tasks, or activities such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help raise awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival really been, with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert ticket really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of clicktivism -- people who feel like they're really making an impact by signing up for something online or tweeting on Twitter?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Organization says it has documented more than 19 million actions by its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said these actions have helped motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its operations, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or funded.
The group estimates that the funds allocated have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and businessmen committed to helping children grow to their full potential, and pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from people around the world.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social justice about undernutrition a marginal commentary on history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracy Allman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the subsidy for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on their website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The people of the world answered: It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B. and Janel Mona are among some of the performers who will be performing at this year's event in New York City, presented by Bear-Lee Forns and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for a sea blockade to delay Russian energy exports.
If necessary, Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia's intervention in Syria - which was made, it's important to mention, at the request of the legitimate government - would be a race to expand into new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
The United States is able, with our fleet, to ensure that sea lanes are open and when necessary to launch a siege to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market, he said.
Zincki addressed the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are indeed identical.
"The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is more or less leveraging and exchanging fuel types", he said, referring to Russia as a trickster of one, because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to increase its export of exhausted natural gas to Europe, while replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to drive pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position received a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, called on the United States to distance itself from EU energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dietter Kampf, head of the German Industrial Organization (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, said a senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for president during a meeting in the town of Holyoke, Massachusetts.
It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, there needs to be a woman at the head of it, she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential race.
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council meeting, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren has been harshly critical of Trump over the appointment of Bert Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
In a tweet posted on Monday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the Senate should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the Senate's intention to run for president.
The poll showed that there was more support for former Governor D'Abdel Patrik's run, with 38 percent supporting his run against 48 percent opposing it.
Related figures from the Democratic Party who rose to prominence in the context of a possible run for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision in January, according to reports from the FBI.
Sarah Palin is referring to the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a meeting of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident at 2:00 p.m.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and with some of the vulnerabilities that our soldiers are coming back to", she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his prisoner the elephant in the room and said about her son and other freed soldiers, they come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back and wonder if what they gave to the country their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military personnel, is honored.
He was arrested on Thursday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, disrupting the reporting of a domestic violence case and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new state asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia issued a "Friend of the Court" statement on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., to support the challenge to asylum seekers' policies, NBC reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Gray v. Schensson lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August has not been disclosed.
She said her violent spouse, the gang members, abused her but official U.S. government officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state senators described the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the recipients of numerous U.S. asylum applications, as nations facing many problems with gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. State of the Union asylum policy reversed a 2014 BIA Immigration and Naturalization Council resolution that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for state asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Carl Rusin, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
Federal law requires that all discussions on asylum applications be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the barrier imposed by the new policy violates this principle, the court's friend said in a statement.
Lawyers also argued in the statement that the policies that prevent immigration from entering the United States are hurting the U.S. economy because they tend to become entrepreneurs and provide essential work, they said.
Attorney General Geoff Schens ordered immigration judges not to provide more political asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"The political asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of a political opinion", Sessions said in a policy statement delivered on June 11.
The goal of political asylum was never to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts are failing in Palo, while the death toll is doubling, in a race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation got worse from moment to moment.
"There's a very tense feeling", said the 35-year-old magician and mother, who is having a baby with a fever in the ruined city's Palau shopping center.
The ambulance is bringing bodies at any moment.
Clean water is rare.
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, torn between water-spotted objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, were lying outside the Palo Military Hospital, where they were treated for severe subsidence that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wall's rubble, I think, Harris told the AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're in a safe place.
US ambassador accuses China of corruption with propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the American Daily, aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Monday referred to the paid circulation of the Chinese daily newspaper Zhenhua Daily, in the Da Wei Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, an allegation that China rejected.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US election marked a new stage, according to official US sources, in Washington's Islamist campaign to pressure China.
Despite the fact that foreign governments will issue trade promotion notices, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a Goa trade war in which each country raises and compares tariffs on imports from its rival.
The tariffs, which China imposed as a retaliatory move early in the trade war, were intended to hurt exporters from countries like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstad, U.S. ambassador to China, former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday edition of The Daily Mail Register, "has reinforced the acts of bullying by publishing ads in our free press".
In its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's precious tradition of free speech and press, and it runs a paid advertisement on the Da Moon Register, Bernstad reported.
On the other hand, in the Beijing street press box, you will find few opposition voices and you will not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on the economic path of concern, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
The Republican Party is removing women's voices before the midterm elections with the Kawano incident, analysts warn.
While many Republican Party leaders stand by Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh and defend him over a number of sexual assault allegations, analysts warned they would see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around the issue was particularly vivid, and most Republicans are officially expressing their willingness to move forward in the voting process.
"Things like this can't be turned back", Grant Rier, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Riehr said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute efforts to open an FBI investigation will be enough to appeal to angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget it tomorrow or November", said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Movement for Progress, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On the morning of the first day, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as we demonstrated in the Senate lobby, as the Republicans in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue advancing Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, according to a Mic website report.
"The levels of enthusiasm and democratic motivation will break new records", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say they've been tall already; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among the floating voices of women in the polls and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their dislike of the president, often avoid voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which exposed her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts argued that she would respond if the Republicans continued to push for approval of the nomination.
"The nomination has caused the Republicans serious trouble", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will accept the nomination, but how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", said G. Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic voting group.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about the extent of their belief in the testimony of Ford and Quano, with slightly higher support in Ford.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony to be certain or likely, while 35 percent said they believed Quano to be certain or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Quano was certain or likely to lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and the allegations made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Quano assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed his genitals to her during a party they attended while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Internet is planning to launch a new Internet to outpace Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who became a legend in the tech world, is the company that will develop Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where to store their data and who to allow access to the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to control the world.
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create a personal online database or POD.
The repository could include a contact list, lists of activities to perform, a timetable, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What unites the personal online database is that only the user can decide who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal self" using data.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the intention is that Inrupt will find the right resources, process and capabilities to help reach Solid to everyone.
Today the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code designers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create distributed applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether or not they agree to a complete change that would cause a complete and overnight reversal of all their business models.
We're not asking them for permission.
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solid network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet by founding the network's organization, W3C, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Also during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm particularly optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: An event to commemorate the World War I Victorian Cross winner
The only Anglican cleric to win, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I was mentioned in dispatches in his hometown, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Chaplain Bernard Van, was awarded the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the British top honours.
The statue was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a march in Bradden, Northampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that exposing the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award was incredibly symbolic.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his regiment across the St. Canton Tunnel through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and four cannons.
He then rushed to the line of fire and with the greatest of bravery led the line forward before rushing to take over one hand on the submast and knocked three of the crew down.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something I know I can never compare to but something that makes me humble.
He and his brother, Dr James Van, also put a stranger behind the march, leading the Royal Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said he was "very honored to take part in the march" and added "the strength of a true hero is shown in the support you've given to many people".
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night watching Blatter 206, and instead got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine you're up all night watching the action of the 206, and finally watching the main event is taken away from you.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live overnight on British Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Jagger Mosssey and Rory McDonald were preparing for battle, British viewers were stunned when the story changed to Peppa Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after staying up until the early hours of the morning to watch the battle.
One fan described the move to children's animation on Twitter as a kind of sick joke.
"It's a government regulation that says at 6am the original content was not appropriate and they had to switch to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Blatter, when asked about the broadcast.
- What? - What?
Blatter's president, Scott Cocker, said they're planning to work on their schedules to include British spectators in the future.
"I think when I think about the repeat, I think we can probably solve it", said Cocker.
But it's six in the morning on a day like that and we can't solve the problem until a day like that in our time zone, which is a day like that in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, there were a lot of text messages exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you this next time it's not gonna happen.
We're only doing five fights instead of six, as we usually do, trying to give more fans and just overdoing it.
It's a matter of lack of respect.
Tom Daley felt down because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, the Olympic water polo player, said that as a teenager he felt inferior to others because of his sexual orientation - but that feeling gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he was in high school that not everyone was like me.
In an interview on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Avern, he said he spoke out on gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running program, Christy Young, has been on a few months' sick leave.
In his appearance as the star of the first season of The Avern Show, Daley said he felt inferior to the others growing up because it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls.
He said, "Until today, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of different, were real things that gave me the strength and the power and allowed me to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they finally figured out what his sexual orientation was.
The two-time Olympic gold medalist became a close-knit leader of the LGBT community campaign and used his participation in the British Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to legalize homosexuality.
He spoke openly about the issue because he felt lucky to be given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time World Cup winner said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, caught me by surprise.
Daly married an Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year but he said age gap was never a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- he first participated in the Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone his age who had similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a white man named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that his whole point of view had changed.
If you were to ask me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal, he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - that he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be in the front row, Dad, he said.
I held his hand while he stopped breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing and really died that I finally realized he wasn't invincible, he said.
A year later, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the Ards medal.
I just knew that this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, it didn't feel so good, he said.
It's also what inspired him to choose his first song - Proud by The Small Stones - which his brother identified during the preparations for the Olympics and still makes him look like a duck.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15pm, British Summer Time.
Michaelson was disappointed in performance and was brought down during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade his performance so the event doesn't turn into a bad pass.
Michaelson, who is taking part in the 12th annual doubles event and set a record, was brought down by the decision of Jim Furick during the Pro Bowl and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he did in games with the U.S. team, Michaelson, a five-time major champion, spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his sideline game in hopes of fixing the sickness he suffered.
Even at the peak of his career, the player's performance suffered from setbacks and upsets. Therefore, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for the National Golf League, where long grass courses are not usually forgiving of shots.
And if the competition itself wasn't discouraging enough, Michaelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, competed against the accurate British Champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with starter Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the American's ambition, which was to lose four points in the first 12 games, was to make it through the first few rounds, Michaelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his actor, although we didn't expect him to say anything else.
He fully understood his role today, slapped me on the back, wrapped his arm around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow, Furyk said.
He's got a lot of self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Fame member and he's added a lot to these teams before, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it turned out and that's how we thought we should keep going.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never really matches his personal highs.
For Michaelson's win, there are 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence added some intangible benefits to the team.
He's funny, circus-like, snappy, he likes to make people laugh, and he's fun to be in the dressing room with, he explained.
I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
There's a lot more to it than the game itself.
European captain Thomas Byrne knows the big advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Byrne, European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day in the Ryder Cup's only games could turn for the worse.
The Danish player started his career at Waldrama in 1997, when his partner in the game, Grandpa Blustruss, had a 5-point lead over the Americans, which he almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a disadvantageous lead and won 141â2-131â2.
I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage at the Waldrama; we had a big advantage at the Brooklyn game, where we lost, and we had a big advantage at the Waldrama game, where we won but with a dismal advantage, Byrne said, in the photo, after watching the 5-3 victory at the 2018 tournament both on the day and the day and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 lead at the National Golf League.
Then history will prove to me and everyone on the crew that it's not over.
We have to give it all tomorrow.
We need to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, trying to win the Cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all the way, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those on the other side - the best players in the world.
Byrne was pleased with his players' performance on the tough golf course and added: "I thought I should never be late when it came to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything's going well, but when you're out there alone, then your full potential as a golfer is being tested.
And that's the message to pass on to the players: You have to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner behind and he needs to make the best of himself.
Unlike Bourne, rival team captain Jim Furyk expects better personal performances than his players, compared to their performance in the pair games, except for Gordon Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who won by three points out of four.
Furyk himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important finals days of such tournaments, having joined the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, as the European team miraculously managed to win the final match, as recorded in the film Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players toward the end of the day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but I want to win the first few rounds, like you saw in Brooklyn, and like you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We make our car accordingly and put the guys on track according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and he will face Rory McClurey in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
"I chose the cast of this series because I think he'll be able to get us to the finish", Byrne said of his single selection.
The receipt of the new German warship was refused once again.
The new German Navy frigate was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but was rejected at least a year later, due to faulty systems and declining costs, local media reported.
The acquisition of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but worrisome issues after the supply shut down the floodgates on the ambitious project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, which the Navy had ordered as early as 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include high-powered cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as evasive technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the newest frigates can be laid up to two years away from home ports.
However, the implication of recurring delays is that the new ships - which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas - will become obsolete by the time they enter service, Di Zeit noted.
The F125 F-125 Frigate came to the head last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a ship to build ships after it was retired.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of software and hardware flaws that made the warship useless for use in combat.
The program's shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half the crew used on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have a dramatic excess weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, and is twice the weight of similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty software, the price tag for the entire project - including team training - also becomes a problem.
It reportedly reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming especially accounted for in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's security committee, confirmed that today, the Navy will ship the first ships capable of launching.
The official source said the problem has accelerated and worsened over time, as old ships have been decommissioned but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be added to the Navy.
The National Trust for Scotland listens to the secret lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is trying to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow European bats and bats as well as brown and long-eared Dobbinton bats in the Inbrio Gardens at Westeros.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the bats' activity throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual monitors.
A specialist sound analysis of all the tapes will determine the frequencies of the bats' calls and who among the species is responsible for them.
In the next step, a map of the living areas is mapped to create a detailed, orderly picture of the landscape, of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dwar, a conservation adviser for the Scottish National Trust (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the herbivores and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as creating sibling farms and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Butterfly populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by development and construction works, which affect the formation and loss of habitats.
Wind turbulence and lighting can also be a risk, and this is also true of fly traps and certain building materials chemotherapy, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, bats' ears are more useful when it comes to prey hunting.
They use sophisticated HD tracking techniques to spot insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, treats the cattle grazing industry very seriously.
She has 10 trained specialists who run surveys, kidney tests and sometimes rescue operations on a regular basis.
The organisation also established the first and only bat reserve in the T'ribe area of Dembridge and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, said the property was the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Tribe we have an excellent area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitats.
But there's still a lot that's not known about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of testing to find bats before performing maintenance work inside the property, as the unintentional destruction of a single population nest could destroy up to 400 females and pigs, and it could also destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and killing, harassing and disturbing their prey or destroying their nesting areas is prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish butterfly conservation fund official, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said, "We have a lot more to learn about our bats and about many of our species we just don't know what their population status is".
Ronaldo is dropping the rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", and said people wanted to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Fidel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese team pioneer Viventos was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mirga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 later to keep quiet about the incident, Dr. Scheegel reported on Monday.
Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million followers on Instagram in a live video a few hours after the allegations were made and called the news "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no, no, what are you doing?
What they said yesterday, Pike News, told the camera the player who won the Ballon d'Or five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
- It's all right.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well. " The actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Schwiggel for the charges, which they have treated as unacceptable reporting on privacy suspicions, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the actor will seek compensation for Mr. Zanzibar's moral behavior in the amount that matches the severity of the violation, which is arguably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Morga reportedly returned to the player's room and the player allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nova.
Mirga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was a good guy at 99 percent who failed by one percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple had sex, but they insisted on the agreement.
Mirga also claims that she turned to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court because she felt resentful of revenge and feared being humiliated in public.
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the arrangement because she's still suffering from trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and he spent the summer on loan to Italian club Juventus for a deal worth 100 million euros.
Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will regret for ever losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said UK Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that a Toyota Britain interview with the BBC, in which he said that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnston, near Derby, was a concern.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit could increase jobs.
The plant in Burnton - which makes Toyota's Oris and Aventis models - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and 90% of them are exported to other EU countries.
From my point of view, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we'll see production shut down at our factory", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's CEO at Barnstone.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mining plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what carmakers call "supply chain risks" in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "time-accurate" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British and other EU suppliers, to make cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it could cause border breaches, and sector officials say they could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota can't keep a fuel tank worth more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May's ZCACs plan, detailing Britain's future relationship with the European Union, is being accurately scaled up to prevent these border checks.
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to seize the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The testimony of Toyota and other carmakers is that the ability to continue to use the successful network of supply chains that we have had up to now is absolutely vital.
Toyota did not say how long the shutdown would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the cost increase would hurt the company's competitiveness and ultimately lead to layoffs.
Peter Zuballeris, who worked at Barnaston for 24 years and served as Unite's president at the plant, said union members were increasingly concerned: "Mansion, if jobs are cut, they will never be returned.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, on which much depends, may be postponed for another week as the battle for Supreme Court nominee, Burt Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and a possible resumption of the investigation by the president.
The Washington D.C. mob has been negotiating for months whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and endanger Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein denied the possibility of carrying a wiretap device to record conversations with Trump and cause the president to be impeached by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day of the month, he arrived at the White House, and according to reports, he was about to resign.
Instead, a Friday meeting was scheduled with Trump, which was at the time of Rosenstein's arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein but at this point the meeting was canceled to avoid a conflict with the hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, testified.
On Wednesday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and again rejected the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "We have not yet set a date for the meeting, it may be this week, I can see a further week of postponement given what is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to keep the press informed.
Some journalists will object to this determination: Sanders has not had a White House press release since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of the rallies was not due to the TV newsstands' stance, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are taking a stand".
She then proposed to strengthen the direct link between Trump and the press.
The president holds more Q&A meetings than any president before him, she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at the numbers".
The press trail will still stand, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this on many occasions, and you've seen that we've done it on many occasions in the last few weeks, and meetings that will allow us to talk to the president of the United States, will replace the press guidelines.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during visiting honors.
His journalistic reasons alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a loose and sometimes bizarre performance to reporters gathered at the scene.
The Health Service writes to EU NHS staff in Scotland and refers to the concerns about Brexit
The Health Service wrote to the staff from the European Union, employed by the Scottish National Health Service, to express their gratitude to the country and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament member Jane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to holding permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in the letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, and it is moving towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the British government has also increased its readiness for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this may be a very worrying time for all of you.
So I wanted to come back and say how much I appreciate the contributions of each of our team members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and the world bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christian Abercombe is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
University of Tennessee Tigers quarterback Christian Abercombe underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from a 31-27 loss to the University of Tennessee Commodores on Saturday, said Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of the University of Tennessee football team, told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercombe oxygen on the edge of the field and then lifted him to Elonka and took him for another test.
A University of Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercombe was being moved to surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no details on the type/scale of surgery and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercombe is a student athlete and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee since moving to Illinois.
He made five total appearances before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the additional income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Conservatives' plan.
The move will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting new voters.
The stamp tax is levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move appears to be an attempt to derail the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract younger voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income households.
The stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the revenue increase will strengthen the government's move to help the old ones in harsh conditions.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp duty, including higher tax levels on secondary housing and real estate investments for rental purposes - could reach a height of three percent.
The Treasury expects the march to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are being bought by foreign residents, a situation that causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for first-time property buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the city - have become drug-free because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help young people buy their first home.
He blamed large building companies for expensive property prices, because they hijack land but don't use it, and urged Ms May to drop her coverage of affordable housing and fix Britain's housing shortages.
Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and a no-fault eviction ban.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my priesthood to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies that are based in foreign countries, can buy houses as easily as hardworking British residents.
The dream of becoming a homeowner has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping under harsh conditions is too real.
My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points ahead of the top-flight.
He moved to the Lighthouse in the summer after leading St Mirren back to the top spot in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I played an international game once and that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But growing up, I watched the Scotland team play a lot of hardball with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team.
Sunderland's previous directors include Dick Adduct, David Moyes, Sam Alderdiss, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Powe, and Paulo de Canto.
The former manager of Aloha Athletic says he wasn't afraid to come after established names at a big club like this, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success will be measured by whether I can get the club back to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it's definitely Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.
Ross started his managerial career only three years ago, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as the team coach of the Hearts.
The next stage he helped Aloha out of the Premier League and elevated Saint-Myrne from the bottom to the championship title position the following season.
Verus says he's more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkkirk, St Mirren and Milton Academic.
It was probably a real crossroads, he recalled, about taking command of Eloah.
I really believed that the management position was right for me, more than the game.
It sounds weird because I played well, earned fairly, and enjoyed some fairly good records.
But an actor's career can be tough.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with you guys about all the stress and work pressure, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to run and now I do, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound, on Sunday 30 September, on Scottish Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, British Summer Time.
The perfect time for a pint beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to the survey.
The summer heat wave increased the profits of the British pubs struggling to survive, but it caused pressure on the restaurant networks.
Pubs and bars enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July -- but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, CGA Business Consulting, who compiled the data, said: "The significance of the continued clear weather and England's long-awaited participation in the World Cup is that July was a similar pattern to June, with pub revenues up 2.8 percent, but restaurants hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales seen in June only worsened in July.
Beverage-focused pubs and bars recorded the strongest performance, with higher revenue growth and decline in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their situation was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the percentage of beverage sales rose 6.6 percent over the month, and the percentage of food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's director of leisure and climate data analysis, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important sporting or social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoor retail market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from last year would be particularly painful in addition to all the halving of fixed costs.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring about a breakdown of what, her, they need so much.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launch.
The sales regulator for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups, with a combined turnover of over Â£9 billion, and is a benchmark of performance across the sector.
One in five kids has social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children - some of them only 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a checking account that they showed their parents.
One in five children -- some of them only 11 years old -- creates social media accounts that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts -- as a reminder to the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old teenage daughter's secret account found out she was asking others to rape me.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of UK Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's troubling that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eylind Doyle will serve as a consultant to the Scottish Athletics Directorate.
Aylde Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the world's most successful athlete in track and field, and head coach Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from a rich international experience over the past decade.
Aylind has gained a great deal of respect from the Scottish, British and international athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from her coming to the board, Betty said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in total, and now regularly serves as a commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it's only time that will tell if I'll recover or to what extent.
It was a daunting task, but I recovered completely, I learned how to walk again, and today I'm doing quick and quick reaction exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement!
Advertising for milk supply comparison between mothers and cows opinion party online
A dairy company is filing opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of what is supposed to be the world's first wearable silent milk supply, private-use technology company Elvie has released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new source provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a cowshed full of a barn to the sounds of a song that included words like, "Well, I'm breaking myself, but you can't see a tail, and in case you haven't noticed, it's not the ticks, it's my breasts".
The song goes on to say, "Shoot, shoot, I feed the babies, shoot, shoot, I beat my girls".
But the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of reactions, the video received engaging feedback from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they too must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within days of their miscarriage, someone wrote.
Elvie's milk pump is discreetly incorporated into the baby's bra.
Another reaction was: "Traumatically, the cow and the circle are one".
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?
Another response said: "Advertising is completely off".
Others defended the ad, and one woman confessed that she thought the song was funny.
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still a nanny.
The rush made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I've been looking at its contents.
It's a genius product, someone wrote.
Another comment said: "This is a funny ad for mothers who are greedy (often at their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like a "spoof".
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women's group finds out that they were all dancing with the discreet inputs in their foreheads.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, without pipes and wires, it discreetly integrates into the cleaning scene and thus gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out during labor.
Anna Blaine, partner and head of the Early Childhood Development Department at Mother, said: "Elvie's resource is such a revolutionary product that she has earned a bold and provocative audience.
In creating the comparison between self-expressing women and transgender women, we wanted to highlight the milk intake and all the challenges it poses, and to show in a humorous, identifiable way the amazing sense of freedom that the new source will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's source has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the track for designer Martha Jacobosky using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention is on the rise despite the fact that the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, and one reason is that the Trump administration's speech and policy has made it harder to move children to foster care.
Usually, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared risking their ability to stay in the country by nominating for child custody.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult households would be required to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior official at the IRS, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had filed for custody of unattended minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the asylum seekers or their families are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we keep chasing these people, Mr. Albans said.
In order to address solutions for children more quickly, officials introduced new laws requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as agreed under previous regulations, the shelter staff reported.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those not found eligible for release will be promptly deported.
The longer these children stay in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this condition can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, said the shelter staff and reports released by the system in recent months.
Advisors say these fears are overcome in larger facilities like Turinello, where signs of the child's difficulties are likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to part with friends could aggravate the trauma that many already face.
Syria is telling the occupying forces, the US, the French and the Turkish, to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'mil also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mahom, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and were treated accordingly.
On them to withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said stop.
Maulham argued that the war on terror was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until the Syrian lands are cleared of terrorist organizations and all illegal foreign presence that it is all together.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the land of the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Maulham said the conditions for their return were good and blamed certain Western countries for spreading irrational fears that had prompted refugees to stay away.
We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return, he said.
They're politicizing a matter that's supposed to be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be sent to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel outpost, has created an opportunity for political negotiations to progress.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has three million people.
However, the pressing elements of the agreement were clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would focus on jihadist fighters, including al Qaeda-linked frontline fighters, who would be destroyed.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, made up of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
The UN General Assembly has set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, said that the work of the panel should be limited to the provisions of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the rejection and scandal finish his presidency before his term ends.
During what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic end in the history of the presidency!
Right now, there's no sign of tiredness among the viewers.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly doubled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers per prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and Ms. NBC's Rachel Maddow's show topped the cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news outlets.
"This is the fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series, "The Appropriate Shadow", which deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the beer.
Lenel Scoble, a longtime comedy writer and author of funny pieces: ...and some hard truths about falling into the Hollywood male circle...
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why?
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Ms. Scoobel told me.
Chaos has a permanent value.
Of course, unlike any other program on television, the lines of contention coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Warrant v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Channel switching or disregarding are concessions that only the most skilled viewers can afford.
And yet, you're pushing the boundaries as educated citizens when you find yourself watching for six hours in a panel of Danish experts using Bob Woodward's confidential mod as the source for his book, Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather bombshell, and the consequences of Hurricane Daniels' horrific accounts of, and sorry for the expression, Trump's anatomy.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does, which gives a feel like a reality show, is that he feeds you something every night", said Bert Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "History for Sale", about the team's changing at Trump's show and the daily appearances of the NFL.
You can't afford to lose one chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kauai Island, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, and he recorded CNN at the same time.
He couldn't break up, not when Bert Kavanaugh was preparing to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
I remember the times we did all these crazy shows before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Funds from outside sources flood the race for the midterm elections closest to Congress
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is facing a financial crisis, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which has led to a two-term race for the same seat.
The district, a Pittsburgh suburb whose boundaries have recently been redrawn, has placed Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th District, which largely borders the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous district divisions had misled, and unconstitutionally, the outcome in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th District sparked a battle of financial strife in the campaign between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election, which garnered wide viewership, for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by a margin of 20 points.
Political commentators expected a slight advantage for the Democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with slight resistance from Washington.
Trump held a hot meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varla in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners fired the Trump company's management team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan any more, the department's spokeswoman, Heather Norbert, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only applied against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the U.S. in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visa-only entry, could hurt a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rejected an emergency conference that was supposed to focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the convention, and ended all deliberations on the sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is set for mid-October, as a symbol of the government's importance, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussions described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions, provided they remain anonymous.
Their claims were confirmed by an outside analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously.
They're learning history.
The next clear thing may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the alleged disruption of Trump's investigative process, for which there is now significant evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly directing his investigation to the question of whether Trump's campaign was cooperating with Russia in its attacks on our election system.
If the control of Congress changes, Trump will find himself holding this body accountable, just as soon as he prepares to face the electorate again, and perhaps a jury.
There are many questions here that start with the PM and I don't mean to argue that Trump's downfall is inevitable - not even for those who have similar roles in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that affect the length of time the fight may last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to wage a coup against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported the Germans in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of murder that resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy is unstoppable, accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported last year that he proposed secretly recording the president and speculating about his inability to run for president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
What if the FBI's investigation into the recent request for Bert Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if his nomination to the Supreme Court is approved despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections and congressional delegates who will blame Trump for the blame?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter's rush.
But I believe we didn't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who also took over my luxurious home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light a candle on Saturday on the same table that carried the crucifix.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of the nonprofit organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of the book The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Durrance of the Rangers optimistic about the battle in Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and know that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw against Real Madrid in Spain earlier this month, will position them strongly to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durans from making his first appearance of the season to tie 2-2 with the Warriors, but he believes the Rangers could use this result as a leap forward for better performance.
"It was a good point for us because Real are a good team", said the 31-year-old footballer.
We went out to the game believing we could achieve something and we got a point.
We could have maybe won in the end but, overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of the fridge in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team's good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind us and make it work.
Women stay awake because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of Nationwide respondents said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking steps to keep the conversation going", said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare the family for treatment unless you express your wishes long before the appointment.
Help your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Employ your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find a way to pay for expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital - as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: find an early resolution to legal disputes at this opportunity.
They found and provided a health care provider, a trusted person who would oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals would fulfill your wishes in case you couldn't communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney in respect of your money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will guarantee payment of bills if you are unqualified.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
We'll put these details in the written plan to be prepared.
The financial side is not the only important point, but who are the doctors?
Where's the medicine?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been found dead in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster caused the media to shut down and the official aid agencies could not get information from Dongla County, a region in northern Palo Alto that was closer to the noise source itself of 7.5.
In Palo, over 16,000 people fled after the disaster struck.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dungalla, in Sulawesi Bay:
Palo is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when it was hit by a tsunami and an earthquake.
Dongla is a province stretching along over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the county, an administrative region within the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the economy of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Dongla.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, which is concentrated mainly in Morvalli, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongla have been hit by tsunami waves several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongla.
A tsunami wave also hit western Dungalla in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and has been permanently damaged by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunami waves of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami wave to hit 14 countries and kill 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and over half of the dead were found in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake itself struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island and caused a tsunami wave to strike the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude itself struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake itself hit one of the islands of Manitoba, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami wave up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Pedi Ghaiya district of Baja, causing devastation and panic, as the locals remembered the devastation after the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami in this case, but over 100 people were killed by the buildings that were destroyed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lumbok, killing over 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska and former vice president's nominee, has been arrested on assault charges.
Pailin, 29, of the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disruption of domestic violence reporting and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a saleswoman tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Preventive facility on $500 bail, according to a KTUU report.
According to the network's reports, he appeared in court on Saturday, pleading not guilty, to be sure, when asked to dismiss his claims.
Palin was charged with three counts of Class A misdemeanor, and could be sentenced to a year in prison and fined $250,000.
He's also charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Paelin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Phelan.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Soldiers' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with the reporting of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Groups of released soldiers criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on the same day.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks have been cut off and the loss rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social media, show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami wave hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Cipulo Cipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare penalty that hasn't been carried out for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saypov, 30, allegedly used a truck rented by Hum DePau to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, and drove pedestrians and cyclists who had been stranded on its path in October.
To justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Sipoub first intentionally killed the eight victims and first intentionally caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent in the death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court's filing, the death penalty can be imposed on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury struck down a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of assisted murder and extortion, which typically used federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required significant planning and deliberation first, the prosecutors said, and described how Sypobe carried out the attack as humble, cruel and fragile.
Seppoulio Habibitsch, a Sypobe, has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angellini, Nicholas Klabs, Anne-Lor Decca, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlig, HernÃ¡n Proche, HernÃ¡n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damayne Paniko, the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York sued for the death penalty in this case was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal case was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express any feelings of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saypov told authorities he was inspired to attack after watching Deas's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked for Deas' flag to be hung in the hospital room where he was staying.
He pleaded not guilty in response to the 22-clause indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Sypobe, said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a guilty plea that would lead to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events on all those involved", Patton said.
Saypov's parole team has previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farragut should be appointed as the negotiator for Brexit.
Nigel Praga has called for the People's Army to be mobilized today during a protest at the Conservative convention.
The former UKIP party leader said politicians must feel pressure from the Eurosceptics - as Conservative MP Theresa May claimed he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham, UK, he would already be out at this point if Prague were to be Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing May, a split in the very divided conservative line, was highlighted by the joining of conservatives who supported staying in the EU to a different protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan, the Czechs, on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, staying-at-home supporters and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try and reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her agreement and the chaos and the chaos.
Boone said at a Leave Means Leave group meeting in Seoul that he wanted to break up with the KKK.
He claimed that Prague should be accepted as a member and be in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
Member of Parliament from Wollingboro added: "I am defending Brexit but we must say goodbye to the KKK".
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: "We did not fight in the two world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone has denied claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative and Brexit supporter parliamentarian Andrea Genkins was also on the march and told reporters: "I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Czar's plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please, drop the charms and start listening.
In a critical message to May, she added: "Government heads keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Prague said at the congress that politicians should be made to feel the pressure if they are to betray a resolution passed in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them you can't avoid implementing it.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: "I want you to make our political standing, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
We call upon the people's army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.
At that moment, the Conservatives marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference in the city centre.
A handful of activists were blown up in conservative protests against Brexit after the group was formed over the weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the opening of the Conservative conference on the security issues they had with the party app.
"These are people telling us that they could have IT systems and all the technology possible to make an agreement like Canada plus plus, a border crossing without restrictions and free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is totally ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator made a statement about the future during a meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently visits President Donald Trump, is running in the November midterm elections against Republican Jeff Deal, who served as a co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of the rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The July event, which took place Saturday afternoon, was the 36th meeting of voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the presenters asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and for a woman to lead.
Arrested in the shooting death of Sims from LSU
Police in the Louisiana capital of Baton Rouge announced Saturday that the suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Monday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during an 11 a.m. news conference ET.
Police posted a video of the shooting on the day and asked for help identifying a person seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early this morning.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died from it, police chief Murphy G. Paul told reporters Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was investigated and admitted to being on the scene when he had a gun and a gun in his hand at Wide Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Prefecture Police Department.
The nearly two-foot-tall junior played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Louis Hamilton finishes with a world title after the group stage gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Woolter Butas went down to the next stage before Louis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team standings would play a big part in the race.
From the first moment, Butas got off to a good start and left Milton almost alone defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Wattel to attack his teammate.
Wattle pulled out the middle stop first and let Hamilton fit in the movement behind the competition, a decision that was apparently decisive.
The Mercedes team came off a late-inning mid-round stop and returned to the race behind Wattle, but Hamilton moved forward after a close wheel fight that ultimately forced the wild driver to leave the inland track to hold out risk-free after a double-run in the third corner.
Max Worstafen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh in the first round.
He then led for much of the race and did not change tyres to get a quick finish and bypass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually dropped to the interim stop in the 44th and failed to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps as Racon took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
The team did an extraordinary job of getting to Dublin, Milton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein in a convention on Saturday, in connection with her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blazey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were mean and mean and liars.
The only thing that can happen and the only good thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and lying, he said.
When you look at the ads and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you have a fling?
Remember her answer... Did you just drop the paperwork?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't do the digging.
So, wait a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't, he added in a senator's imitation.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not cover up her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to reports in The Hill.
She asked me to keep his confidentiality and I kept the confidentiality of the letter as she asked me to.
But the Senate denial doesn't seem to have been accepted by the president, who responded to it during a conference call Saturday night: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe it's not [leakage], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to return to power at any cost.
You see the convictions, the outrages, they don't care who they hurt, who they push on the road to power and power, the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars with a 5-3 win against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee's stars recovered from losing the Elite League on a day and a half to the Belfast giants and won the next game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Clouds had an early advantage over the two goalkeepers Patrick Dwyer and Francis Wheeler had.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Caoney put their team back in business until Dwyer put the business back in the lead.
Francois Boucher was the benchmark for the Dens until two goals from Lucas Landwald Nielsen promised the win.
This is the third losing season in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat the Dendans 2-1 in Belfast, on the day and the weekend.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won their last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 by Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford cooked Wheeler's goal when he doubled the score four minutes later.
In the first full quarter, Sullivan brought the home team back to play at 1:10 p.m. until Matt Marquardt cooked up Coney's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer promised the Giants' lead on the first pitch when he hit his second home run of the evening, at the end of the first third.
The home team was reorganized and the remaining scorers again tied the game at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nelson give the Dunners a lead for the first time in the game, at the end of the second quarter, and Nelson secured the Dunners' victory with the fifth goal, which was scored from halfway through the final quarter.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes on home soil in the next game on Sunday.
An airport inspector sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board could escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian airport inspector was hailed a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure a plane carrying hundreds of passengers would take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on the afternoon and caused a tsunami.
Strong subterranean quakes continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But although many of his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gnavan Agong refused to give up his position, in a strongly rocking control tower at Motera Sis airport to Ghofri in Palau.
He's been in place to ensure that flight 6321 of Atlantic Air can take off safely.
Then he jumped from the watchtower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Seret said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news network ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the Ellican airport in Clementon to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palo.
"Our hearts were broken to hear the gospel", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands as the Indonesian disaster relief agency says access to Dongla, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
According to the report, the death toll will continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible, said agency spokesman Satopo Forou.
Waves up to six meters high destroyed Palo and the city will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Reesa Cosma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-market shops are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelpand, who heads the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working fast to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy already, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who came to Palau on Sunday and told the state troops, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN report.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in the country of Lombo, which killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after a plane crash in Laguna
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, after previously claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely disembarked from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement starting Saturday afternoon, it was not able to say what happened to one passenger.
The airline said it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water, while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuc.
Officials said on Monday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all others are in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed its course.
American traveler Bill Gaines said the plane hit a very low orbit.
"It's a very positive thing", said Gaines.
Gaines said he and the others managed to make their way to the emergency water exits at the height of the mast on the sinking plane.
He said the plane crew was stressed and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the sink also helped with the rescue operations, using a floating boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the Air Safety Network (ASN) states that 111 people have been killed in airline crashes in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst describes the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution proved its case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of the defendant, Quinton Teles, 29, and her movements by the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she was murdered.
According to the Calorie report to the editor, Roult said he received location data from a number of cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, and thereby hiding his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another objection was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records say they only knew each other for a week.
Roult said that shortly after Chambers died, Telis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
He erased her from his life, Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
What is hip hop conscious?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinion of the genre and fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed Triad from Bristol, claimed that hip hop has moved away from its origins as a tool for expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to get back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fuji and Commune have recently been brought back to life in the UK by artists like Akalla and Okie.
Another black man?!
New York nurse suing a couple for firing after a racist text message
A New York nursing home is suing a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving an unintended text message from her mother who complained that the nurse was still a black person.
The couple denied being racist and likened the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lynsey Flasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giles Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There is no other black man", Ms. Flasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris, twice.
According to a report in The New York Post, after noticing the mouthwash, Placebo-Plexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nurse, who was of African-American descent, had done a bad job and that she now expected to hire a Filipino woman in her place.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for firing, asking for $350 a day for six months of work and residence in the place she originally rented, though without a contract.
I want to show them, look, we don't do things like that, she told the Post in the day and she added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple fought back over claims that they were racist, saying that Morris's deal was being called off, out of fear they couldn't trust her after they hurt her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists, her husband, Joel Placebo, told the Post.
But would you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your soft baby?
Come on, you know.
Placebo compared the lawsuit to extortion, saying his wife was due to give birth just two months before the incident and was in a very difficult situation.
You want to go after someone like her?
It's not nice to do such a thing, the investment banker added.
The legal case is still ongoing, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Gankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the position of someone reading the book for the first time before it's published.
It's very exciting to know now what we know about Paddington's enormous success.
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before he was inspired to write the children's book Little Bear, was becoming bloodthirsty about his rejection of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was Jammire-Thaker, after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of the eventual success of Paddington, whom she described as a very important friend of our family.
He was a quiet man, not a proud man, she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like you had a kid who achieved something: you're proud of him even though it's not really your fault.
I think he saw Paddington's success more or less like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself.
My daughter was a jerk and I had to say hello on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed in panic to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly and said she was in a really bad situation, not expected to last, Mrs. Adnan-LaPros said.
I got a call from Mandy, and he said she was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her stage going slowly disappeared out of her system.
She died sometime before that and it's over, it's over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't lick or scream or cry because I was surrounded at this moment by families and people.
I really had to hold on.
Eventually, Mrs. Adnan-LaFroux, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who were unaware of her ordeal.
No one would know, she said.
My head was slender, and tears were pouring all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a wonderful sense of identification with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women mourn virgins on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones who committed suicide, work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hemprez hung posters on the Walsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel like I do every day, she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leiden, said her son was a promising chef with a sticky smile.
Everyone recognized him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the whole room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid of a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis created the bulbs so people would know there was someone to turn to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk.
Mrs. Harris, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her life partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say he was depressed or depressed or anything, she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of the stairs on Christmas Day -- when the kids opened the presents he didn't make eye contact or anything like that.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they overcame it:
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Bert Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought, if we can really get what he asked for - a limited time and scope investigation - maybe we can bring a little bit to the Union", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be torn apart by the party's deep-rooted cover-up.
Why weren't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters interested in an FBI investigation?
Their discouragement is all about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail to win them, they will be very weak in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to hire them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and approve his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of herons in North Korea.
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seok, quoting data from South Korea's Union Ministry, said the number of kidnappings last year was 1,127, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were the more severe border criticism between North Korea and China and the increased amounts of people being forced to flee.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean Kurds eventually acquire South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than the well-maintained military zone (DMZ) between two Korean states.
China treats the refugees as illegal immigrants and not refugees and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the negotiations on dismantling nuclear weapons.
The meeting followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to act generally toward an era when the Korean Peninsula will have no nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally dismantle our weapons first", Lee said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bart Kavanaugh a historian, and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee "Historian" and said his character did not allow him to serve on the Supreme Court.
Flossie responded to this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever appeared like this, they would say "historical", Flushy said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that Dr. Christine Blazey Ford was sexually assaulted when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kawano was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and choked when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also denounced the Democratic nomination to the committee and called for a plea against him for a "matched-characters murder" and a "Grotsky" murder organized because of the anger of the Liberals over Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Flossie said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed a previous view against the Democrats.
"I think he's sculpted himself with these statements and the way he's chasing the Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Flossie hesitated when asked if she would try to expel Kavanaugh if his nomination was approved, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
Put it this way -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI then he's not fit, not just for a Supreme Court justice, but for the court he's currently serving, Flossy said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Flossie added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kwano's possible objections to Obama's health reform or the verdict in the case against Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided wishes about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
There's no reason for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and watch someone say, "No, that's great", Flushy said.
And women should use it.
It's a harsh criticism, months and years of anger rising to its limits, and she can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stineam told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, is it?
She kept on, and I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, and she said that she cried when she got excited, too, but she developed a technique, and every time she got excited and started crying, she used to tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept pulling.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears take the rest as the source of anger, among other things, because they are not understood at heart.
One of the most significant memories of my early days at work, in the office with most men, is that I once found myself crying in an unspoken rage, and an older woman grabbed my neck, and it was a cooling system that I was always a little afraid of -- and dragged me upstairs.
Don't let them see you ever cry, she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy they've managed to suppress you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Art was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason she wouldn't consider running for president herself.
It wasn't a decision I thought about well, she told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because she joined the campaign late, she broke the fundraiser, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
They think I'm getting a discount?
During the speech, in which she announced that she would not run for office, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that was so silent about fundraising and focusing on voters instead of representatives, and anger at gender discrimination - that she was drowned in tears.
"You could have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Roder recalled the way the press reacted to her.
You'd think I was sponsored by Clintons.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write about my situation?
She's crying in class?
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening pitfalls of the US-China trade war were daunting, and while the war is far from over, a split between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when he imposed taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar, steel and aluminum collectors.
The most significant uptick came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded to the same currency every time, and recently raised tariffs by five to 10 percent on US $60 billion worth of goods.
China has pledged to retaliate against every blow to the United States, and it's unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to return means a submission to its demands, but a public appeal to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to handle it properly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could positively support China in the long run, and reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic disruption in either country is actually far more dangerous than what India has seen in the past", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia, at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is willing to return refugees willingly and calls for help to rebuild the country destroyed in a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'mil said conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the war on terror, he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to return the situation to normal.
All conditions now exist for returning the free-will refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures designed to harm their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'mil said the Syrian regime would welcome help rebuilding the ruined state.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the USA by a final score of 16.5-10.5 at the La National Golf Course outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when captain Thomas Byrne's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who wrestled for almost the entire tournament, sent his batting from the T-shirt to the water on the 16th floor of PAR-3, losing the game to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari brilliant in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to reach 5-0-0 since the tournament's inception in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spitzer was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbivorn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's number one ranked player, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may be the last Ryder Cup player.
With a record of eight Ryder Cup appearances, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European player with the highest number of victories in the tournaments with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team, and I'm glad I could help, Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the cap to his hometown's legendary Gwon Ram who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the only game on Sunday.
"The great pride I feel, defeating Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record is now 13-21-3, a career Ryder Cup record.
These are some weird statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, with only Jack Nicklaus in front of him.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find its way on the turf, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinnaeus who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
All the credit to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
We need to take off the hat.
We were defeated.
